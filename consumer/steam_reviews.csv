105600,Terraria,"You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun. You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.   It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.  Terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.  Building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.  The game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.  Plus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.  Watch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.",1,1
105600,Terraria,The fact that people call this a copy of Minecraft astounds me.,1,1
105600,Terraria,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"When I first saw my friend playing Terraria, I thought it was a 2d MineCraft. Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft.

Hopefully, I can do this right:  Exploration   Terraria    2d side-scrolling   Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 38)   You can find loot and ore, without even going underground   Minecraft    3d world   Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 61)   You can find loot, and bars or metal above ground as well (Minecraft Wins)   Spelunking(Mining/Underground Exploration)   Terraria    13 ores, plus an additional 4 ores once in hardmode   Generated caves, as well as, other aspects of underground like Abandoned mineshafts, houses, temples, etc.   You can dig straight down to hell!

105600,Terraria,The best casual sandbox game out there. Other popular games just fail to stand up to what Terraria has become,1,1
105600,Terraria,"  This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.  The essence of  Terraria  is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.   Pros      Customization : There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.     Exploration : The  Terraria  world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see 'The Creation of the Guide' painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the  Terraria  world, you discover something surprising.     Creativity :  Terraria  is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors.  Terraria  features innovative design at its finest.     Progression options : Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.  You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently  had too many options  and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.     Balance : A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into.  Terraria  manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.     Diversity :  Terraria  promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.  I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.     Automation :  Terraria  would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.     Performance : Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements.  Terraria  is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough* Starbound *cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy  Terraria  in its full glory.     Quality of life : Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is  Terraria 's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.     Continued updates : It would be very easy for  Terraria , as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.    Cons      New player friendliness : The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in  Terraria 's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.     Grinding : While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet  Terraria  is not above this issue.     Moddability :  Terraria  is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.  ",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I always thought that terraria was a great game, but after 1.2 patch it became one of my personal favourites! This game is a 2D RPG-platformer in randomly generated worlds.

105600,Terraria,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the 'crafting' genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Before you read this is NOT LIKE MINECRAFT! These are the only similarities: -They both have mining and exploration -They both have zombies to fight -They both have bosses -They both have Hell (an underworld)  That's all i can think of at the top of my head. Now, let me tell you about Terraria's advantages: -It has 13 (I think) bosses, unlike Minecraft only has 3 (I think) -It has TONS and TONS of enemies -It has over 3,000 items and weopons -It has Heaven and Hell -It's caves are more fun to explore and easier to find  Now, Terraria isn't all good, in some peoples eyes, in someways like: -It's 2D (I don't find it a problem) -It's too 'confusing' or 'boring' (again, I don't find it confusing nor boring) -It's a 'copy of Minecraft' (no it isn't btw) So, I hope you like my review and I encouraged you to buy it. *Add me if you need a partner for co-op gameplay* (NEW CHARACTERS)  EDIT by arachnid14 1. terraria has over 3900 items 2. they both have some form of electricity/circuit building 3. both are blocks (duh) 4. terraria is cheaper to buy and goes on sale occasionally 5. 2D is good since minecraft is already doing 3D and it would be kinda boring for the games to look so much alike 6.terraria has like 12 pets 7. minecraft has a useful pet 8. terraria makes light come from you when your holding a torch",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo, rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been. The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite.   While the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode. This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update. The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion.   Another issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage in and so on in standard RPG fashion.   While the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends. I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Before you read, Terraria is NOT a copy of Minecraft.  In my opinion, Minecraft is a fun and really good game for building, but I stopped playing it of boredom a couple months after getting it. I did not play it every day. Now, Terraria is good for Building, Exploring, Fighting, Destroying, and is rewarding. Minecraft is very unforgiving; When you die you lose all your stuff and you usually can't get it back in time. In Terraria you can choose to only drop your money (It's easy to get it back.), you can choose to lose some of your items, or you can make your character die forever so you need to make a new one. I have been playing Terraria for +150 hours and I am still not bored of it the slightest bit. Also, if you still think it is a 'Stupid Rip-off of Minecraft' I am fine with that, BUT notice Terraria has 14 bosses... in PC. Minecraft has 3. ( Thanks for telling me =-=TheDragonBorn03=-=! ) Terraria has +70 Swords And +50 Armor sets while Minecraft has less than 10 of both of those. I hope this review helped you chose wether to buy this game or not, And thank you for reading this far!   So, in my opinion, Minecraft is the superior for building and has almost endless worlds horizontally. Terraria is the superior for Fighting, Exploring, And looting. It is also very addictive and it is hard to pull yourself away from it.  Honestly, I get on Terraria for multiple hours a day and I get on it every day.  Also, The bosses are hard, especially during Expert or Hardmode, and they give you a sense of achievment when you beat them.  Just noticed that I am comparing not reviewing -_- Well, Here's a bit of a review. Terraria Is fun and when you kill a boss they drop some pretty useful Items, and there is really progress because as a beginner stuff like crimtane and shadow scales and demonite and tissue are pretty good. When you advance that stuff is considered garbage. Killing the Eye Of Cthulu is challenging... until you kill the wall of flesh or some others. Once you kill the wall of flesh for some reason... (COUGH) progress (COUGH) All non-hardmode bosses become easy.. Byyyyeeee",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam. I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play. The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago. All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary. I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag. I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time.   We've all been kids; kids love to explore. Exploration is the foundation of Terraria. You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there. Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.   There's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper. It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you. Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake. Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister. Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see.   Terraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be. It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) &amp; moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best 'graphics' but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania &amp; 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!",1,1

105600,Terraria,"'This game is a Minecraft clone' -A Suck-up Minecraft Fanboy/Fangirl, May 16 2011-Present  The only reason they claim it's a clone is because it's open world, and has a few similar weapons (which technically, a lot of games have swords, and Minecraft wasn't the first) but overall, the un-modded version of Terraria is actually better than most modded Minecraft games, in my eyes. Some people complain that this game doesn't have enough content or doesn't get updated enough, and then claim that Minecraft is better (even though Minecraft only has at most 1/4th of the amout of items Terraria contains). Minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game! There are only a few things I find extraordinary in Minecraft: Creepers, anything involving the Nether, anything involving the End, and anything involving the Mushroom Islands. The list is so much bigger for Terraria! There are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semi-original or 100% original. In fact, the only thing I wish Terraria had that Minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators. This game isn't even 'endless' like Minecraft claims, and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years! I strongly reccomend this game (if you can't already tell). This game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games: lots of items, the developers stay in touch with the community, and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like: 0_0 WOW.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a small 2D adventure game. I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.  [Gameplay] In the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. 'The First Night'-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10  [Crafting] Ah.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch. The coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some 'speacial' position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...  [Bosses] This is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard. If you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!! On Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is 'The Twins' The one have 20k, the other 23k HP. Good luck! 11/10  [Multiplayer] Oh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.  [Final Review] 'Terraria' is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!  *Sorry for my bad english!*",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I NEVER expected this game to be as complex as it is!  At first I checked it out and was like 'Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D' and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected.   In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it. I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely! If you don't mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you!  PS: There are some pretty amazing items inthe game, if you get far enough! :D",1,1

105600,Terraria,"I Myself enjoy building, mining and open ended games. This is something different though. It combines the adventurous feeling of 'path of exile' and the 2D yet amazing type of art of 'starbound' and 'edge of space'. This came as a gift from my brother. He noticed that I was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and I didn't have it, so he spent his own money, or steam credit, to buy me this game. It is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment. Thanks bro.  Many people would call this '2D Minecraft' and 'pointless, silly and plain rubbish'. I however disagree, as this game has more enemies, bosses, items, biomes and many more. This game is out on many platforms and I simply love this game. 9.5/10. I would like to give my thanks to re-logic and the rest of the group for this game. It is astoundingly beautiful.  I shall now talk about the gameplay. You may customize your character's original look, and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh, allow double jump, save you from from injuries by dodging, etc. You also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour, therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style. You have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items, too. You can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat. I personally collect hats as a hobby, so I could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm. The multiplayer allows pvp, and it's own version of ctf (capture the gem). It also has teams, allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other. This game has a wide range of NPCs, ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl. The nurse can be a bit rude though... But I don't care. She gets the job done. You can build a condo by the ocean, or a mansion in the roots of a tree. You can hollow out hell, or reside in the clouds. You could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool. The crafting is fun, you can make potions easier than in minecraft, and the traders don't go 'HMMM'. That is an automatic upgrade.I just love this game, and if anybody says that it is bad, then I have a tear run down my cheek. Just joking.  I would like to thank: Redigit, D-town, Cenx, Crowno, Will, Aaron, Jim, and anybody else who helped make this game. I have changed my rating from earlier: 10/10. Terraria has a lot of potential, yet is still a FANTASTIC game.   Anyway you look at it, it is full of colour and beauty. Thanks. This is a true game.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.  Terraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.  One of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.  Of course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real 'story' to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.  Firstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in 'congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements'. I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.  Now, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.  Speaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this: - Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt. - The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot. - The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself. - And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier.  What I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.  Enough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are. - Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that - Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that. - Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that. - Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.  Finally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the God damn Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long.   Look, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!     Enjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one.   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation ",1,1
105600,Terraria,"  Holy hell. What a ride this has been.   I first recieved this game when I was selected as the winner of a giveaway. I thought, 'Whatever, I've played Minecraft. This game is probably the exact same as it.' After all, there are certain similarities between both games. Find yourself stranded in the wilderness, mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win.  But the similarities end exactly there.  Now, this game, in the starting phase, is actually quite bland, and I nearly quit because of it at first, but with the help of some friends, I stuck with it. It was pretty generic stuff. Mine some boring ores, build a boring house, feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon, or dying and dropping your money. You'll die quite a bit as well, but don't let that discourage you. The moment I realized the exact depth of the game (and realized Iactually loved this game) was the moment my friends and I summoned what is to be considered the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. The intensity of the battle, especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor (hint: armor is your best friend!) made victory all the more satisfying. The adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses Minecraft in it's entertainment value. Yet I believed that was all the game had to offer, that one bit of awesomeness.  WRONG!   Excluding event bosses, there are over 14 different and unique bosses of Terraria, each with their own unique powers, and in Expert mode, their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack, from the Eye of Cthulu's blinding fast rushes to the Skeletron's deadly skull spin. No two bosses are the same, nor can they be approached in the same way. Nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building. But that's not all. because you know what's better than killing a boss?  Sweet, sweet loot.   Emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration, but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better. From shields that allow for bash-like charging, to a scarf that reduces damage by 17%, every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot.  Now, about now is where you can pick your specialization, especially if you're playing with friends. Will you be the hulking tank, absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates? Or the looming mage, casting deadly spells from behind, or an archer, raining down death from above? It doesn't matter. After all, in Terraria, you're free to do what you want.  And right when you think things are getting bland again, hardmode hits you. All of your weapons and armor's effectiveness is quartered. Enemies are a challenge again. Venturing out at night is a near death sentence. New enemies will spawn, and new loot along with it. But again, don't be discouraged. You'll die quite a bit, after all. Build your strength up again, and go kick some ♥♥♥.     ",1,1

105600,Terraria,"The most used comparison for this game is Terraria/Minecraft. I shall explain the difference between Minecraft and Terraria (edit: terraria is better) Exploration- Minecraft- 3D world, practically limitless, several biomes, intresting underground areas. Terraria- 2D world, you can control the size, several biomes, deeper underground areas. Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc. Building- Minecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily. Terraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get. Combat- Minecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon. Terraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability. So Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft. So there. Shut up about this game being a rip off, you Minecraft-F-N-A-F-fanboys-who-will-rise-to-protect-'the-best-games-of-all-time'.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Adventure game that's all about building and fighting giant monsters. Sounds like another popular game, right? I assure you, it's nothing like it.  In Terraria, you are the player. A custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace. Not to say that the game doesn't have it's fair share of building, aswell.  The combat is sort of simple, yet charming. I always love going on expert mode with my end-game character and fighting a bunch of bosses. It's always good fun. And while I may not be the best at building, I enjoy it too.  Terraria has to be my favorite game of all-time. Period. Just throw 10$ USD at the screen to get it, seriously. It's dirt cheap.  If i missed anything in this review, don't tell me. Go make your own review. I'm sure you can make something that's much better than what i can do.  ..What's that? You already own the game? Well what the hell are you doing here, go play it!",1,1

105600,Terraria,"You can nuke waves of zombies with explosives bunnies. You can pelt Santa Claus to death with rotten eggs. You can murder enemies with bananas.

105600,Terraria,"*EDIT* 6/30/2015  Steam Multiplayer has now been added!  When I first saw this game, I thought of it as another Minecraft clone. Now that I played about 100 hours on record, I now know it isn't a clone of Minecraft, it is better than Minecraft in my opinion. Its a 2D adventure game, with alot of bosses and crafting. One thing I don't like about it, the Steam multiplayer. In most games, Steam allows you to play with other people using Steam, in Terraria you have to host your own server. At the end of the day, Terraria is a great game, and I recommend it.  10/10",1,1
105600,Terraria," Introduction:  Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.   Pros:  -Customisable characters with cloud support.  -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from. -Various mounts and pets to choose from. -Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour. -Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers. -Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses. -More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying). -Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.   Cons:  -Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).   Overall:  Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game. I personally rate this game a 9/10. :)",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This game is like a time machine, only that you can only go foward.   For example, start playing at 8 pm. Blink. Now its 4 am.  See? Magic.     I would rate this: my time played/10",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I remember.  Started to play a bit more games than just CS:S and CS 1.6. My brother had found this new awesome game that could be a potential minecraft, but for slower pcs, and with a hell lot more content.   Back in 2011, you had to hammer crystals. You had to use a wooden axe to cut wood blocks, not a pickaxe. You couldn't get past a 1-block tile withouth jumping. Background was ugly, so was the sun. Rocket boots needed mana. Liquids were buggy, so were walls, there was no expert mode. The Twins were awfully hard, so was the destroyer. Star Cannon was OP. Making a bridge to fight WoF was tedious. I had pirated this game, i'll admit that, but even then, even with those annoying things, even with the sluggish gameplay it had, it was one of my best times of my childhood and the most fun i've ever had with a game, so beautiful seeing it develop like a great Indie Game deserves.  Thank you Redigit. You've made my childhood brighter.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"What is Terraria? Terraria was a game that, often mistaken as a 'Minecraft clone' and often seen as '2D Minecraft'. Even after all that nonsense, Terraria was still a unique and a very young 2D adventure game that dragged many players into its world. After 1.2 update, Terraria became even larger, selling millions of copies, but then just after 1.2.1, it began to slowly die off. Fans were crying for it... Not until something wonderful happened. Terraria was released on consoles, slightly extending its life, and then, there were rumors about a big update for Terraria on PC. The 1.3 update was litteraly an explosion of new content, and yes, its true, +1000 items were added into game. This has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history. Free updates are still coming, adding more and more content, together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun.  If isn't obvious by now, Terraria is much better than Minecraft in all aspects. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too, but Minecraft alone will be never as good as Terraria currently is. So, what does Terraira feature that makes it such a great game? Let's start from what you can do in Terraira:  FIGHT! From smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with, to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe, you will learn (in a hard way) how dangerous the lands of Terraira really are. You are nowhere safe, not even inside your own home, as during certain events, swarms of enemies will break into your house, attempting to turn you and your fellow NPCs into a pile of mangled corpses. Hell, even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness (if you haven't defeated them yet). Even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies, your world is still in danger. There are biomes, seen as 'evil', that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world. You are only one who can prevent this, so you better get a move on!  You will come across thousands of enemies, as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them. There are so many weapons to choose from, that everytime you start from beggining, you will find different set of weapons and armor to use. This is what makes replayability in Terraria great. From weapons, you have: swords that are ten times larger than your character, swords that shoot swords, bow that makes arrows rain from sky, large variety of machineguns, launchers, pistols, laser weaponary, craziest magical items you'll ever see, lots and lots of ammo types, and much, much more... Once you got yourself a good gear, its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating. Gain their loot, and progress deeper in world of Terraria, eventually unlocking the 'Hardmode' in your world, where real adventure begins and where only real heroes (your characters) shall become champions of Terraria!  BUILD! Hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from, Terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there! Most of blocks have their own theme (e.g. Marble represents acient Greeks), as well as their own set of furniture, such as bathtubs, tables, bookshelfs, lamps, etc. Some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building, meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items. Once you got everything you need, its up to you what you want to build. A house made entirely out of bones? Slime? Glass? Honey? Or make it steampunk themed, alien themed, have golden toilets, garden full of large glowing mushrooms, color shitfting blocks, beds made out of flesh... I can go forever like this, the options, are truly endless! You can even shape blocks with hammers and/or color them, build traps with wiring system, wall tappets, decorations, paintings... Remember, you world... Is your canvas! You can get NPCs to live inside your marvelious creations, and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful.  Oh, and also, you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground. These blocks are made for pixel art!  EXPLORE! A small world of Terraira contains everything you need, but just imagine what large worlds offers. All you have to do is explore them! You will find large variety of awesome loot, accesories and weapons for your character to use, statues to collect, and most importantly, ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health. But beware, as I said, nowhere is safe. Underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist, as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches.  If you have hard time exploring the underground, try fishing! With fishing, you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground. All you need here is bait, good fishing rod, patience and with enough luck, you will be swinging fish-swords and shark-pickaxes at your foes!  COLLECT! Collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun. Being able to own everything that exists in Terraria is satifaction at its best! If you like collecting stuff, you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings, hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again, just to get that one item that you don't own, only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again. Or a throphy to decorate your walls with. Ah, lovely!  CUSTOMIZE! In order to customize your character in a way you really want, it needs a lot of effort. You will need to fight and explore a lot, as well as get NPCs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them. Terraria also features 'social slots'. With these slots, you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives. In-case you find one armor likeable, but you don't want to wear it because you already own a better armor, just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it, and your actual, better armor, will still provide you its perks and abilities. Social slots are made for cosmetic purposes. You can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors, as well as using hair dyes for hair. There's an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft, as well as rare dyes that glow, have animations, reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects.  Should you buy this game? Why, of course! Its worth every single copper coin. And has multiplayer too, which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddy/buddies to play with. It has holiday events during halloween and christmass, where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events.  I gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun, as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that Terraria can offer. Well, will you?",1,1

But believe me, when I started crafting better gear, fighting new mobs, and building my home, I became immersed in Terraria. There's an endless amount of content here for only $9.99 and if you were like me thinking this was just a 2D Minecraft rip-off, you couldn't be more wrong. Definitely a must play.

105600,Terraria,"Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.  The game has 2 stages :  1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer 'tutorial' where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.  2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).  There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.

105600,Terraria,"Well I think it's about time to review this gem.  Terraria is one of the best value-per-dollar games you can buy on steam. Period. Obviously some of the free-to-play games can match that value (because you spend nothing) but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous!  Ever since 1.0, there have been 3 absolutely game-changing updates, for completely free. The game was already worth it just at 1.0, apart from bugs, but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game. 1.0 got the basics right; satisfying combat, fun exploration, lots of sandboxy things to do, but as I just said, it's sandboxy; there's a lack of an appropriate ending besides 'get the most powerful stuff.' 1.3 gave us the Moon Lord which is the equivilant of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft; it doesn't end your game after you defeat it but it's something tough even with the gear you get from him, so it feels like a climactic end.  You'll start off small with your copper shortsword, or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it. After many hours you'll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you, from bows to guns to MAGIC, and from simple 'take less damage' armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends.  On top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding. There's so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing, and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun. On top of those cosmetic things you also have the (as of a recent update) fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or opening/closing doors.  And on top of THAT you have the massive variety of enemies to fight, some of which will completely obliterate you and you'll enjoy every minute of it. All of the bosses have their unique elements and you'll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out (like the first time that the Corruption boss comes out of the ground).  AND ON TOP OF THAT you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesn't have enough content. Whether you just want more content or complete overhauls, the modding community's got you covered in user-friendly mod managers and easy mod installation.  So basically I'm saying the game's pretty good and you should buy it if you haven't already with how often it goes on 50% and 75% sales.  EDIT: Also you guys should totally nominate this game for the 'Test of Time' reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and it's one of those games that pretty much every person on Steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"'2D Minecraft' - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.  Terraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an 'ocean' with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems.   Terraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.  Throughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.  And when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.  So is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with! (Co-op always makes games better).",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Massive creative time sink. Dig like a boss.  This is one of, if not THE best values on Steam for the amount of time you can play it vs. the money you will spend.   Terraria has had two massive updates for free already, as well as both a Halloween and a Christmas update that added many more items, enemies, events, and bosses as well.   The game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game.  Exploration, mining, and item collecting is a big part of the game. With the 2 major updates, and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find, get from bosses, and simply craft. For the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50-100 hours searching for all of these alone. You can find and craft armors, melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons. You will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others. You can plant gardens for potion ingretients, find special keys to unlock more chests, banners, paintings, statues, etc. for decoration. You can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks.  Boss fights are for the more action orientated players. The game has 2 modes. You start in the normal, or 'easymode' we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldn't be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons, armors, and accessories. After defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into HArdmode. This is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear. You also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find.  The real longevity of the game, however comes in the crafting and building aspects of Terraria. AFter you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores, found your gears, etc. you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures. The game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport! The building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game.  Not only can you do ALL of this alone in single player, but Terraria has CO-OP/Multiplayer! You can do everything you can in the single player mode, but with friends! Share and trade items with others, go and fight bosses together, or join together and create a massive art project, or city. Look around the net for Terraria artwork. There are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the Terraria players out there.   Terraria is one of my favorite games I have on Steam and is one that every STeam gmaer should own. The game goes oon sale regularly at 75% off so you can get it for $2.50 regularly. It's a steal even at full price.   Also, don't forget to check out Terraria Online for the wiki and the modding community. This game has a very nice and active mod community. So even after all of this you can still get mods too!  The game also has trading cards.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. Old old Terraria.  I used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server, it appears I played almost 140 (138) hours of this game and it was pretty darn good.  Terraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie RPG with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is NOT a Minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination, no no no. To some, it could even be better.  Terraria features a huge amount of enemies, items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed. It also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome.  First off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason I love the game are the amounts of items, there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse. Let's just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed.   Next off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses! From a giant worm to Cthulu's old eye, there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game.  However, Terraria still has it's flaws. And one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why I don't play anymore.  There is a large amount of grinding involved. Certain enemies drop certain items (Skeletons and Piranhas used to/still do drop hooks, but only Skeletons and Piranhas) and some have very low drop rates. Again, this might have been fixed. However, that was merely one floor amongst many positives.  Back to the positives: One thing I forgot to mention was the housing system. Whenever you make a compatible house (You can't just make a random crevasse and expect it to work, you need to create a proper actual house) an NPC will move in, but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the NPCs respect, such as kill a boss which I think you needed for the Dryad. There are many, many NPCs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things, especially the Nurse who seems to have a crush on the Gunslinger, but again nothing is done with that. Don't expect cute Guide X Dryad crap to happen, sorry shippers. That'd be cool, if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more NPC's.   There is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns, they're all unique and it'll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies, and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is INSANE. It'll take estimated 200 hours and over (Don't quote me on that) to see every little tiny bit of content, if not 300 hours. But once you're done with that I'm not sure if you'd want to come back to it.  And finally... The combat system. It's very basic, especially melee wise. But once you get late into the game you'll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items that'll mix everything up.  And the final verdict for Terraria is... 6.5 out of 10. I feel bad for not ranking it higher, but the grinding (and the fact that it's not really my kind of game altogether) causes it to be a 6.5/10, which is a 'great game!' to me.   Until next review :) Bye!",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.  One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.  As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.  There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.  As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.  Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.  That is what this game is about.",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ♥♥♥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever.  We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.  I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.  Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?  The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. 'SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON!

107410,Arma 3,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D",1,1

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg.

107410,Arma 3,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.",1,1

Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group.

107410,Arma 3,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.  Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.  At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.  Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.  For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here’s me trying it anyway.  The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.  I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I’ve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.  What you don’t get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you’re in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you’re sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing.   The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.  Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more? Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.  Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn’t the game you’re looking for. Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign – those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don’t expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before – the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.  Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players.   So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I’d certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.  I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I’m not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I played this game about 90 hours which is more than any of my friends at the moment.  Can't really compare it to any other game. Arma is just Arma, period. xD If you haven't played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles, but no, not really. Most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out. Then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds. Repeat.  Playing this game requires strategic thinking - you can't just take gun and take enemy out, no, it doesn't work that way. This game features two maps: big and huge, including towns, forests, mountains, flat fields and graaaas grass grass. Yeah, i love grass in this game - looks fantastic. xD So... Where was i? oh, right, the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles, civilian vehicles, helicopters or planes... You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods. Repeat.  Anyway, this is nice game(yet you need some great rig to run it) with limitless editor and mod support. Best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends. Team Work is necessary.  Pros: +Limitless warfare simulator +Graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time +in-game editor allows you to create your own missions +Steam workshop support: download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles. +It's not CoD +It's not BF4 either +Bugs are fun  Cons: -It's probably boring for players from other shooter games -Limitless CPU usage: your cpu will cry like a вitсh during the 100 vs. 100 battle with tanks and helis. -Graphics doesn't look beautiful 20% of the time. -Not so big default weapon arsenal(but there are mods, hey) -Multiplayer performance sucks sausage -Campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in Arma 2 -Bugs are still bugs even if they're fun -AI has IQ equal to chair.

Casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as Wasteland and King of the Hill.

Besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources. Feel free to do your own research, check out the Zeus game mode, as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found  https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi .  tl;dr Game is awesome, very moddable, hours of gameplay.

107410,Arma 3,"While the animations, graphics, lighting, and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the ARMA series, I miss the ARMA 2's setting, units, and mods. ARMA 3's 'future-istic' setting doesn't make sense, and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd. While I appreciate the new vehicles such as the MRAP 'Hunter' or the newly updated 'Ghosthawk' (Blackhawk), or any of that sort of updated feel. I'm not saying change is a bad thing, I'm just saying sometimes too much change isn't.  A great addition to the ARMA series, was the much requested 'stances' available to you during the game. Whether it's leaning from standing, crouching, or even laying on your side in the prone position, it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks, windows, and walls that you're either too short or too tall for. There are 3 standing stances, 3 crouching stances, a sitting position, and a prone position. Every stance except for sitting, allows you to step out to the side, or lean around cover. From the prone, you can peak a corner, or lay on your side. This vastly improves over ARMA 2's restricted movement. It would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls, or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well, but that's just wishful thinking.   Another thing I noticed, is the sound of the weapons. A lot of the weapons have similar sounds, which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you're getting into. While some of the sounds such as explosions, vehicles, and other small ambient additions are nice, I feel like I'm often confused and lost with the sounds. Hopefully, a good soundmod will fix this later down the road.  AI. . . AI. . .AI. . . One thing the ARMA series hasn't been able to nail down, is the AI's movement, pathing, communication, and skills. I realize that it's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this, where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective, or how, but often you'll either find your allies falling behind, running out of formation for a second, or asking 'Where are you' after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves. It would be nice to see AI being able to figure out things based on other AI, and not almost strictly from you. Combat awareness. Something I noticed in ARMA, is that no matter what situation, the AI in combat are lacking, whether an enemy soldier, or a friendly, you'll notice them not finding cover, running into the middle of a street, or from behind cover out into the open. On one of my first 'showcase' missions, I was instructed by my AI squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover. 'Neat' I thought. He then gave me an area to suppress, as I was an automatic rifleman. I began laying fire down from my position, my own squad leader walked next to me, and as he gave an order, ran right in front of me, bushing me back, and causing a bullet to hit him in the head, resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing. Note, the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second, leaving me no time to react. Their aim isn't that great either. You could be standing across a room and they won't be able to hit you, or they'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of-guard yet, not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it. Now, this goes both ways. To combat them being 'too easy', you could set the dificulty to Expert of Veteran. The problem with this, is that the change is too extreme. Setting your game to the highest difficulty, results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily. You could be concealed at night in a bush, and taking you out. That, or you'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley. My advice? Find some friends or a group to join, disable AI teammates for the mission, and only play with a team made up of human players, 9 times out of 10, you'll be able to accurately cover teammates, move together in a more realistic and effective way, and it will increase your expierence 10-fold. Here's an example of the Helo AI in this game.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203646487   Another weird problem you may notice, is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer. You may or many not have issues, and to top it off, it's really sporatic and without a known cause. In singleplayer however, this is not the case, and the game runs a lot smoother. and it is quite confusing, and frustrating when trying to set your settings. Here's an example. You go to singleplayer, and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering. The game looks great, and you're real happy with it. Now your friend hops on, or you want to go play on a server. You select one with the best player/ping ratio, and join it. You notice right away your frames are a lot worse, and you sit the tinkering with your settings again, mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game. Not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game, but when you join back to singleplayer, the game looks worse, and you either have to deal with the settings again, or get stuck with lower graphics. Now, changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either, so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration.   Overall: If you're a fan of the ARMA series, or any realistic shooter, I'd go for ARMA 3. While I still play ARMA 2 more, ARMA 3 offers enough change when I get tired of the former. Improved graphics and lighting, vehicle handling, weapon handling, and the use of different combat 'stances', really improves over ARMA 2's static and prohibited movement. While you won't be in the deserts of Takistan, or going through the dense city of Zargabad, the Islands of Stratis and Altis, are sure to give you the variety and fun you'd want. While the AI isn't improved much, some of the futuristic units, and factions don't fit well, and the sounds can tend to be confusing, ARMA 3 is definitely a step in the right direction, and a giant leap towards success.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I rarely rate a game this high, but this one is a perfect 10/10 for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.  Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic, there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc. However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC, then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.",1,1

107410,Arma 3,"I've owned and played every single Operation Flashpoint, Arma and all their spin off's, and this one is sheer perfection!  Pro's -Insane level of Graphical realism at all levels. Such as terrain, textures, facial animation, destruction of enviroment...right up to bots that look all too human.  -Very forgiving game system that allows players with out of date gaming rigs to still be able to play. -The most realistic shooting system bar none! Employ the Ace 3 Workshop mod and be the sniper. The kit includes everything the modern military sniper has in his kit. Such as wind direction compass, ballistic charts, and this all comes into play with true real world ballistics. Buildings come down, certain cover doesn't provide cover. Bullets go through multiple people. With mods in play it gets very bloody.  -Unlimited number of workshop items, maps, scenarios, servers etc already out there and tons more coming.  -The best, most real online gaming experience.  -A full sandbox mode that is so good that I have not been playing anything else but Arma 3 for months. Pretty much expect to see me living in this game in my spare time. This is the best game I've ever played!!!! -Thousands of weapons, vehicles, attachments, bot types, nationalities etc. EPIC!!! -Gigantic, fully sandboxable maps that stretch miles upon miles in all directions. There must be 100 maps. I have at least 60 dowloaded and that I am playing with already. -ISIS, Taliban and other scumbagery to put hot lead into. Buckle up soldier...you have tea bagging to do!! -Here is the biggest one of all. The mods in the workshop, that are totally free, give you every single mission and map...from all the other Arma's and Operation Flashpoints. So if you liked the Arma Gold Edition and loved playing with the vehicles and different units, then Tada....SURPRISE, there in here too! So own one Arma, and own them all if you have 3 and the Mods. Just check out the mods I subscribed to and go nuts. I am! -Stupid hillarity. When you see the first guys reaction after you smoke the guy he is healing. Make sure you have the Bloodlust Mod and The Head Popper Mod on. :)  -This is a crazy one. WWII units!!!! Yes, you can have ISIS taking on an SS Panzer Division if you wish. One decision? Which scum bag to play as? There are several mods that bring WWII units, tanks, and aircraft to the game and WOW, does it make this a game and a half to own. 4 words, Moisin Nagant sniper rifle. Nuff said! -There are too many positives to go on about. The game is everything I ever wanted in a first person shooter. 10/10!!!! Cons -You down own it yet and are stuck reading this. Go buy it you cheap bugger! :P -Very few. -Still thinking.... -Stop PRESSING ME!!! -Ok, a few things. Load times are long. -The servers are filled with gaming Gods.  -Some mods will get you Vac banned, so turn off the ones that apply to getting you banned. Their pretty darned obvious and it's simple enough to do with turn off all mods button. Then just click on the few that are allowed on servers. No biggie.  -Some mods have issues with other mods, so it's like Skyrim. So expect a few crashes here and there as you figure out what works with what. However with me having over 150 mods in play at once, I'd say this is beyond minor. You are looking for gripes right? I don't have many.   So in the end I am going to say this is the FPS you always wanted. If you didn't know you wanted it and you are a gun nut, a blood thirsty nut, and overall fan of seeing heads coming off at the seams, then luck be a lady tonight...this is your game!!!",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"*sigh* where to start. It's 2015, why is a game of this caliber is being locked at 30fps? While the frame rate cap is editable, you have to go into the config to do it instead of the main menu. But that doesn't matter, the game is terribly optimized. Whether it's capped at 30 or 60fps, you'll get major framerate drops. A single GTX 970 isn't even enough to keep it at a stable 30fps, which is completely ludicrous. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing a game like this.  What makes it worse is that, at the very last hour, they edited the Steam sub for the people that got the free Nvidia copy for buying a GTX 970 or 980 so that they wouldn't get the Harley Quinn pre-order bonus. Why do that? You already give away a free game, why take away a little pre-order bonus that everyone else who pre-ordered would get?  It just ends up making a lot of people angry. For months now people have been asking whether or not the people who got the Nvidia free copy would be getting the Harley Quinn pack. They were completely unclear on it, just beating around the bush.  This is no way to treat your fans.  At this point, this game isn't worth buying because of technical issues and such a terrible practice by it's publisher. Even people who got this game for free must feel like they got betrayed right now.  Save your money, wait for updates and play something else in the mean time. I recommend the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a game that is much more optimized for PC, developed by a group of people who actually care about their fans.  Update 1: No patch yet, but after some tinkering in the config file. I've gotten the game to run at a somewhat more stable frame rate. If I stand still or move slowly I can maintain a stable 60fps, but as soon as I hop into the Batmobile or start gliding around, frame rate will start dropping anywhere from 50's down to the low 20's. The worst part is every now and then the frame rate would tank so hard it would go down to single digit, like several other people have noticed. So I guess for right now, maintaining a stable 60fps or even 30fps is impossible unless you want to play Batman: Walking Simulator.  Update 2: I got a chance to play the game a little bit, so this post will be about the gameplay. The combat and control are great and responsive, You never felt quite more like Batman than you are in this game. You feel powerful. The entire Gotham City is your playground and it feels amazing to traverse it. The only problem I have with the gameplay is that driving the Batmobile in 'Pursuit Mode' felt pretty bad. It was hard to turn around corners without smashing into something, combining with the terrible frame rate and let just say I rather just glide across Gotham City than drive the Batmobile. I really hope they tweak the control for the Batmobile, it's my least favorite thing about the game right now. 'Battle Mode' however is great, only because it's alot easier to maneuver around with it on.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Updated 10/29 for the PC re-release that happened on 10/28:  Many of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved, but if it came out as-is today I would still say the port is pretty disappointing. Many people who couldn't play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now, but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience.   The texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone, but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene.  Image quality is all over the board, but is improved quite a bit by turning off AA, CA, and film grain effects.   Speaking of effects, there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of post-processing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at. The most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered. In 1080p, lens flares look more or less as they should. At 1440p you'd think Batman just had LASIK surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on. Considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a JJ Abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating.  If you're a huge batman fan and you've been waiting to play this game, I'd say it is definitely playable now. If you're on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease, I'd say wait until it is heavily discounted.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Original review of initial release version:   One of the worst PC ports of all time.  This game had some incredibly misleading advertising. In the Nvidia gamework promo reel, posted to youtube by Nvidia on June 6 (only a few weeks before the game was released), they show ambient occlusion and rain textures - both of which are present in the console versions, and entirely absent from the PC version. The same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps, but the game ships with a 30fps cap. By editing an .ini file you can remove the 30fps cap, but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level (they look pretty similar to the textures from a Nintendo 64 game).  Aside from the false advertising, this game can't even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that FAR exceeds the recommended specifications. For example, despite having the game installed on an SSD, and running a 980ti with the latest drivers, I still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations. For example, any time I get in the batmobile, I am watching a slide show for a few seconds.  Save your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed (if it ever does get fixed).",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Edit 30/10/2015 People are still commenting on this review so I'm making this edit to let people know this wasn't updated to reflect current patches in the game. I returned the product shortly after it was released. There has since been two performance patches which reportedly improve things. I decided not to purchase it again as it's so close to November when other games launch and my time is limited ATM.  *** If your interested in purchasing the game look for more current reviews. ***   ---  Played it for around an hour so far.  The combat is fun and responsive, the gliding is great and the game looks okay (AF is set to 4 by default which makes some textures look awful). That's the good parts.  The bad parts are the framerate issues which are all over the place and the batmobile. The game will frequently pause or dip to sub 10 fps on a gtx 970 when entering or approaching new areas. Cutscenes have similar issues to witcher 3 in that while in engine they run at even less fps (by default the game itself is locked to 30, tweakable in the ini files) than the normal game making them stutter or appear stilted.  Summoning the batmobile causes major frame rate drops. At one point I summoned the car to try the batmobile takedown move. By the time the frame rate recovered the batmobile had crushed the pack of guys I was fighting including the Riddler henchman I wanted to interrogate.  The batmobile itself handles awfully. There are forced batmobile sections which involve chasing targets such as tanks or vehicles. The handling makes some turns difficult to pull off and the vehicle feels clunky. Some have recommended turning into a tank for a small amount of time for more precise control but this kills all momentum. Tank mode is really boring but necessary to take out armored vehicles. If you eject while under attack from armored vehicles batman will get upset someone is wrecking his car. There doesn't appear to be a way (yet) to deal with vehicles without the batmobile which ruins the feel of the prior batman games. Hopefully the need for the batmobile is limited later in the game.  Unless this is patched soon it's definitely a refund. I bought the game based on the prior Rocksteady Batman titles which played well on launch but this is a terrible PC port. Never really expected the game to turn out this way but I guess alarm bells should have triggered when there was no PC review prior to launch.  Edit:   For those commenting my PC is below min specs. It's not  Win 7SP1 i5 3570k 8gigs ram SSD  970 GTX  If you want to see what the gameplay was like for me see this video by RPS.

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"POST PATCH UPDATE  My did this take a while, well the game has now had a major patch and things are...better. The game is still by default held at 30fps but now an option in the menu has been added that lets you choose between 30/60/90 fps although they do say if you put it above 60 you may experience some issues with the performance. In my experience the game runs much better than before I get a solid 60fps on maximum settings (not including NVIDIA crap) during fighting/walking/gliding/grappling with almost no hitching, however I must say while driving the batmobile you can get 60 around the outskirts of Gotham but in the center where its busy and there are more npc's and other cars it does drop to around 50fps quite frequently. While this is not great it is certainly better than the 20fps it used to be when driving the batmobile.   The options menu has had loads of changes more suitable to PC with texture settings actually having an option for 'High' this time rather than just medium which brings me to the games graphics. The game looks marginally better although not really in any significantly noticeable way. While batman games always had that shiny polished look to all its textures, I find that the moody lighting and glossy textures tend to hide the fact that some of the textures just aren't that great meaning walls, backgrounds and such; but they are good where it matters I suppose such as the batsuit, batmobile and generally all character models.  So should you buy it? Sigh this is a rather hard question but let me try to expand. I feel like this game is in a playable state, not perfect...but playable. However, I urge everyone not to forget the disaster that was this games launch. In my opinion such a terrible launch and treatment of the PC community requires that we show WB and Rocksteady that this is not ok by voting with our wallets and not buying this game. By doing so, showing them that this is unacceptable and if this is the state in which you release your games and it takes you like what 3-4 months to fix this then you don't deserve our money and support. So if you don't have any strong reason to buy this game then please don't. There are better games out there that you can still buy, if however you are intent on buying this game then at least wait for a sale because working or no this game is not worth its standard price. Take note of this games launch and please don't preorder and keep an especially keen eye on WB games since its clear whatever they may be publish to PC will likely crash and burn since they don't give a damn about PC and PC should not give a damn about them.     ORIGNAL REVIEW  - Performance issues everywhere. - Had to use ini files to uncap the default 30fps lock. - I have drops to around 23fps on a rig that supersedes the recommended system requirements. - Do you have an AMD graphics card? lol good luck m8  It's a shame because there is a good game somewhere in here but the performance issues make it unplayable, I strongly advise against buying this until it is patched and begins to work properly. As it stands right now DO NOT BUY IT",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"This is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. - The framerate is capped at 30FPS - There are barely any graphical options.  - You can uncap the framerate in an ini file but then the FPS is all over the place even on my Titan X. - The PS4 version actually looks better(!!!) than the PC one becuase the PC is missing some shaders and effects  For shame, WB, for shame...

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"'Gameplay' video - real fun starts at min 6.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKy2BEHKeyE&amp;feature=youtu.be  Note: This review is a work in progress, as a PC gamer my first couple of hours of any game is playtesting and seeing the performance on my rig. I am using a 970 on stock settings and 3570k overclocked to 4.5ghz with 8 gigs of ram, just for a frame of reference. Game also uses Denuvo DRM which has been reported in previous games that used this such as Dragon Age or Lord of the Fallen to have performance problems associated because of the processes behind the DRM. It is my hope that this title doesn't see any performance impacts because of the DRM implementation, but sadly I think it is...once again. Seriously, do we need ANOTHER layer of DRM on top of the already existing DRM (Steam?) Ugh.  PC PORT IS LOCKED TO 30 FPS BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT. 'TURTLEBOATS YOU DONT NEED TO SHOUT MAN, NOW YOU ARE MAKING ME SHOUT!'  -To change the ini files go wherever your game is saved and go to: Knight\BmGame\ Config\BmSystemSettings.ini and change the parameter for 'MaxFPS=30' to 'MaxFPS=60' -To delete the intro video files go to Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Movies and delete StartupMovie and StartupMovieNV.  Graphics Impressions: The game is really hit or miss at times and while the game can look good, some textures arent as crisp and tight as you would hoped it would be. At a distance the graphics look servicable, but once you get close to even some of the thugs, they look like reused assets from the previous games. The graphics settings in this port are honestly bare bones (you cant even tweak how high you want aliasing to be set at!) The game looks a bit outdated in areas but that should not come as a surprise since the game is using the same engines as the previous Arkham games, so while they have probably maxed out what that engine can do, it does not have all the bells and whistles you would like to hope for in a next gen title. It looks as though without the nvidia settings, the max settings on this pc port is on par with its console brother. There are a limited number of specific Nvidia exclusive graphics tweaks that seperate it from the console version, so in that sense it is dissapointing.  To me the best way I can describe how the game looks is: washed out. The textures aren't crisp, enemies float above the ground after you knock them out, pop in happens quite frequently. The best parts to me graphically are the parts where you are soaring down around Gotham and seeing all the vibrant lush neon lights.  Gameplay Impressions: Combat feels better than ever, it feels a bit more faster and fluid than the previous games (got through playing the series recently so its easy for me to compare.) To me I loved how the combat worked in previous games, but felt it was just a tad slow, nice that its sped up here. No more walking through tight corridors or seeing the same locales like in Asylum or even City to an extent, this games world is massive. Zipping from building to building with Batman's arsenal makes you wish a Spiderman game was only this good at its 'web slinging' action. There is a great sense of speed while you coast from building to building and is quite fun. One moment you are on top of building, next moment you are flashing toward some thugs and blistering their bones. You can now also interrogate your victims and make them spit out some pertinent information to your mission. Launching in and out of the batmobile in pursuit of some random street thug or being propelled in to the sky all work seemless and make me excited to play with my new toy any chance I can get.  Its too bad the best moments and the highlight of the game - the gameplay - SUFFERS because of the shoddy port quality. I have had my fps drop to as low as 20 in some cases. Something I have never seen happen on my 970 before running a game on its max settings (this is without the nvidia effects toggled on.)  Performance Impressions: The games open world looks good, not great. That said for a game that looks like this it should not have my framerate stuttering all over the place at times. Other open world games like the recent The Witcher 3 actually look more impressive in many aspects compared to Batman Arkham Knight, and perform way more stable. I think the stability and the game being locked to 30fps is a very telling sign that this port was - nay - IS rushed without all the bells and whistles you would hope for in a next gen PC title.   I will update this review later with a video with my gameplay performance using the 970. Thanks for reading and I am hoping to have more detailed impression as the night progresses. As of now I feel a bit bamboozled out of shelling out money for this, yea you can fly and punch baddies like before and its open world.... but it just doesn't look or perform like a next gen title should even with the Nvidia fluff on. The Witcher 3, really made my standards of PC gaming high, not only in a gameplay aspect but graphically speaking as well.  Game feels really good when its WORKING and smooth. Heck I even had tons of fun just doing donuts and seeing the smoke effects in the batmobile at 20fps glory. For what its worth, I quite like the batmobile segments. You can cruise through walls, call it in to literally steam roll a group of bad guys, and it doubles as a freaking tank with eye popping particle effects.  The combat is tight and responsive as ever, however the performance just bogs the game down way too much for me to say that this game is an instant buy right now. Couple this with the widely known game hindering DRM Denuvo, it is just mind boggling, companies continue to support DRM practices that hinder their own game and risk the games integrity in order to make another buck or two. All signs point to Rocksteady rushing this port out.  Update 1: Game port was outsourced to a company named Iron Galaxy. Well, there it is. Update 2: Last update for the night its 4am! Uploaded a quick video of the gameplay, take care for now my fellow Dark Knights. Update 3: Supposedly new Nvidia drivers are out today - will try them out and let you guys know if anything changes. Update 4 June 24th: Thanks for everyone being informed gamers and doing their research. It is my hope as well not to only get a better product I paid for and was eagerly awaiting for just like you, but to help set a precedent for future PC titles from big pubs/devs. PC gamers should not be treated like second class citizens. We pay for digital titles that we can't sell back unlike console players, and are often left mercy to the corporations (its what they are) to fix their games. We aren't guaranteed anything, thankfully Valve is now accepting refunds and reports of customers from thid party vendors like GMG are now willing to process refunds.   This is great news for us PC gamers. We have no excuses anymore but ourselves if we continue to support faulty products even if we are given the chance to get a refund. While I am dissapointed with this port, without problems like this, we as customers would continue to be treated in such a manner and there would be no progress.   I am willing to give Rocksteady/ Iron Galaxy one chance, since they know and openly admitted to screwing up this port - thats a lot more than what Ubisoft ever did for their scam on Assasins Creed Unity for many of us. I will continue to post my impressions of the game and keep you guys up to date, as well post a follow up to the performance after the next patch. Iron Galaxy/Rocksteady, take your time - please don't rush the patch just like you did with this port. For myself personally this is your last chance. Update 5: Rocksteady has issued a public statement saying they are pulling the game digitally. In the meantime I plan on finishing the game for the review, and will post my impressions on the patch when it comes out.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Terrible port which runs like crap:  * Textures looks way worse than their console counterparts. * Ambient Occlusion missing on PC port. * Locked frame rate (30fps) * PC port developed by third party (12 employees)  This is one of the worst releases I have seen , this should stand as an example of what happens when you trust a third party company.  Unfortunately since I ordered the game from GMG I can't get a refund but I strongly suggest that people that got the game from steam should apply for a refund.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"As much that i hate downvoting a great game, this titel deserve it.. I'm running a 970 with a i7 4790k and getting 30 FPS and alot of problems (stutter, soundbugs etc). I have waited and was really hyped to play this game and it saddest me too se the PC port be so bad this time around.   (Please read the updates i do in this review if you have some questions or disagreed with me)  Pros: Looks like a great history (only 3 hours in the game) Fun combat system with amazing cool combos  Driving the BATMOBILE :o Really huge world to play in. Alot of things to do.  Cons: Bad performance.  30fps LOCK Stutter, soundbugs, etc. Bad looking textures. Really bad PC port.  Buy this game? If you dont mind the problems atm, i would pick it up BUT not for full price.  Thanks for reading the review. :)  Update 23-06-2015:  Okay, you can remove the 30FPS lock, by going to your go to this in your steam library: G:\Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\Engine\Config  Then double click on 'BaseSystemSettings'  Then press ctrl+f and type in 'fps' and now you can change that to 60 but i dont recomend going over 60 as it will most likley crash.  I still stand by the review even tho you can remove the 30FPS cap. This is 2015 and a game that release on PC should not have been capped at all.   Update 23-06-2015:  I know my english isnt good, but that should not stop me from doing this short review. :)  Update 23-06-2015: I have now talked to a support @nvidia becaruse many have told me that the game have some problems with the GTX 9xx series. Nvidia says that they have a few problems with the cards and i should be fixed ASAP.   Update 23-06-2015: After i removed the CAP and turn Blur off im getting a steady 60 fps while running around etc. Sadly the FPS drop quite alot when im driving the BATMOBILE or flyving around in Gotham. Textures are still looking bad &amp; many soundbugs still is there. :P",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"1. Horrible stuttering where the framerate is anywhere between 60 and 3 FPS when I glide or drive on my Radeon 290x.  2. 30 FPS Lock on a PC release is unforgivable. 3. NVIDIA Game Works things hammered in that makes the performance of AMD cards worse, Thanks for being a part of the team NVIDIA and Rocksteady. 4. Price of the Season Pass is too high for the amount of content that has been revealed to be included. 5. The native Anti-Aliasing in the game options still gives the game horrible jaggies. The option is either on or off for it. 6. Not many graphical options, and those there are makes little to no differance to the performance.  Cannot recommend at it's current state.

Seriously though, I've got sli 980 Ti's(I'm only using one with Arkham Knight because SLI is broken atm...) and the game installed on an SSD and the performance is woeful if you unlock the framerate. It's the year 2015 ffs a 30fps cap is not acceptable, especially for one of the biggest releases of the year on PC.   SLI is broken, along with the low-res textures/assets, streaming issues and stuttering, there is NO Ambient Occlusion in the PC version at all, rain effects/shaders are also missing that are in the console versions, just check some comparisons that are starting to pop-up. The bloody game crashes after exiting, every time. The PC graphics options are woeful, not to mention all you get are 'Low' and 'Normal' textures, that's it...really? Even at 4k there is aliasing/shimmering, and it just emphasizes the other graphical anomalies. I've never had this many technical issues with a PC game.   Also, for a game that was heavily plugged by Nvidia and makes use of Gameworks, why is there no Arkham Knight 'Graphics, Performance and Tweaking Guide' that Nvidia routinely does for all the big game releases on their Geforce website? They did one for GTA V, Witcher 3 and Dying Light, so surely Arkham Knight warranted one? They obviously knew this PC port was a steaming pile of crap and they've tried to hide it as much as they could before release. There were no PC reviews before release either, all reviews were on the PS4 version apparently.  Do not buy this game in it's current shape. Cheers.",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Yet another AAA title that fails actual playtesting and is shipped out to unsuspecting consumers who hoped it might not actually run like balls. Given this game runs on Unreal Engine 3, an engine pushing over 11 years old at this point, it has performance that makes GTA IV run like any Source game in comparison.  Rocksteady have in the past demonstrated great optimisation in previous titles. My old laptop, which ran a GT 555m graphics card could maintain 60 fps in Arkham Asylum on the highest settings. This game, on my GTX 970 (which is one of the top 10 best graphics cards currently on the market) can barely push 40 fps stationary, and between 5-30 whilst moving. Good thing we got that enhanced NVIDIA driver to improve our performance!  I think the worst part is that graphics wise, its not really much of an improvement over its predecessors. The post processing effects look really nice, and the rain effects are pretty gorgeous, but the overall texture and model quality just barely look better than Arkham Asylum, and that game came out NEARLY SIX YEARS AGO.  I cannot recommend this to anyone until they fix the performance issues. Also, you can tell its probably a shoddy console port because the left the 30 fps cap in the .ini file.

Plus, with this video card, there should be no reason for these low framerates on 'normal' settings in an Unreal Engine 3 game.

This game is the industry in a nutshell!  Well Kotaku and IGN gave it a 10/10 so at least it passed the SJW test somehow! Thank god i got this turd sandwich together with Witcher 3 when i bought my new Graphics Card and didn't pay any extra money for this pile of Dreck!",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Months ago this game was bashed by every PC user for the horrible launch. Since then I've watched and read dozens of reviews of both PC and PS versions and it was still getting mixed bad opinions. Therefore I had low expectations when I bought it a few days ago, only expecting the tech issues to be fixed.  Now that I've finished the game I can safely say it was a great and very enjoyable experience. I won't spoil anything here, not a big fan of the ending but it was a great story. All the little touches and details you would expect from the previous games are here as well. Never had a stutter or crash and I'm on a slightly above average PC.  Won't go in detail, just want to say this - if you were put off by the fail-launch and negative reviews since then, give this game a chance. I love the previous ones in the series, but this is the first one I almost completed at 100% (only riddler trophies remain and they are really a grind). And the top point of many reviewers that the CAR is shoved on you and takes away - I was afraid of that, but no, really no, it adds and takes sometimes but it's not in any way obtrusive.  If in doubt - buy on sale!",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"  SPOILER-FREE REVIEW    My specs: Windows 10 with 8GB RAM and an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.  There is a lot to be said about the final chapter of this trilogy, and while not all of it is good, I still definitely recommend the game. Let's get the BAD out of the way so that we can focus on the GOOD.  First, every time I entered the game I was warned that I only had 4GB of RAM, and that the game recommended six... *looks at my specs mentioned above, then back at warning* :\ Yep, I'm pretty sure that EIGHT gigs is not the same as FOUR, but I digress... This did not seem to affect my gameplay.   GLITCHES:  I only saw two actual game glitches. One was where a character mysteriously appeared OUTSIDE of the compound where I'd been fighting his crew, and the other was that the bat signal indicated a quest item being over the WRONG building. Not bad, as far as glitches go!   TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  They are many, and could be game-breaking if you are not comfortable with adjusting some files. I had no troubles in the beginning, but then the problems started: Lagging, crashing, and even completely shutting down my computer with zero warning. *cries* Lagging I can deal with. Crashing I can deal with. Shutting off my computer over and over again? WHYYYYY??? It started happening so often that despite how much I was enjoying the game, I was beginning to think that I'd have to stop playing...  ... and then I found the   Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT   thread here at Steam, and my hope was rekindled. It turns out a couple of files corrupt over time, and all I had to do was delete one file and one folder, then verify the integrity of the game cache (very easy on both points), and voilà -- WORKING GAME! *cue angels singing*   GRAPHICS:  If you don't have a new enough graphics card, the game won't even start for you. The plus side of the high-spec card is that the graphics are amazing. From the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers, Gotham City truly feels  alive . Every crack in the sidewalk, every fierce tattoo, each choppy wave, an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know MORE. The people may not be as attractive as in previous installments, but they are more realistic, and they truly have  character . The devs have introduced a photo mode, where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360-degree rotation to get just the perfect shot... Just use the Steam shortcut you set up (F12 default) to take screens, and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot.   THE GADGETS:  We do have a couple of new gadgets to play this time around: A voice synthesizer which allows us an extra layer of tactics by giving orders to assailants, plus the Batmobile, which I'll come back to in a bit. The gadgets are by and large underutilized and not really explained, bringing back my recommendation to play the games in the order in which they were released: Asylum, City, Origin, Knight. Not only will these previous installments give you a feel for the story, combat, gameplay, and general useful knowledge, but you'll get to play some GREAT games!   THE INTERFACE:  Most of the controls are the same as what we're accustomed to, though they had to do some tweaking in order to include...   THE BATMOBILE!  What a great addition to the series! Not only can you zoom around Gotham City like a boss, you can destroy half the city as you go~! I had great fun running down criminals (literally... Muwahaha), blowing up cars, knocking down trees, fences, support pillars... you get the idea. *evil grin* In addition to a new form of transportation, we have a great many quests, riddles, and fights to win using the Batmobile, which is not only a car, but a BATTLEmoblie! At the touch of a button we can transform it to a highly-maneuverable tank in order to kick all ♥♥♥... We can even do Batmobile-assisted takedowns with Wayne's patented non-lethal rounds. 'It's like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla!'  Many of the Batmobile quests are optional, but you will need to develop some proficiency in driving it, as eventually you'll have to use it to progress in the story.   COMBAT:  As usual for the series, combat starts off deceptively easy, then amps up in difficulty as you progress. We have the new Fear Multi-takedown ability, which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds... provided that you can come upon the group by surprise. There are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once, and during this time you can do multi-character takedowns. Those are great fun, let me tell you! ;D  We have some new attacks that we can do whilst gliding, plus the items mentioned above, but nothing really game-changing about the combat. We've got our guys with riot shields, cattle prods, brutes, guns... and a few little extra things that I'll let you discover for yourselves.   THE STORY:   When the game started, I felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline. I went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was, but why we were being attacked... Absolutely  positive  right up to the moment of the unmasking, and then... Everything changed. That which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating. My mental shift was profound, as far as such things go, and it pulled me into the story in ways I had never considered. Although one aspect of the story I had totally nailed, there were several real surprises throughout, something which I really cherish. A good story is something that I truly appreciate, but you have a good story with great gameplay, and I'm in heaven!   THE ENDING/THE RIDDLES  (Still no spoilers!) :  You must secure a certain number of criminals in order to view the final sequence of the game. You do not have to 100% the game to see the ending, BUT, to get the FULL ending, you have to defeat The Riddler, and THAT means solving, saving, maneuvering, finding, and destroying a total of 243 riddles, people, courses, trophies, and destructible items.  The riddles are the one thing I won't be doing 100% on this time around, though I did get 100% on the rest of the content.  If, like me, you don't plan to solve every single riddle in order to secure the post-Riddler portion of the ending, then NEVER FEAR, YOUTUBE IS HERE! Although some may feel that it's not really important to see that extra tidbit of story, one little sentence during this scene completely changed how I felt about the ending of the game. I'm not gonna add a link, since that's just too tempting to click, and I want this to be spoiler-free.   THE BOTTOM LINE:  Batman: Arkham Knight is flawed. The devs have no plans to fix that which is broken, but you CAN fix the problems yourself! If you're a fan of the series and can problem-solve enough to follow the instructions in the   Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT   thread, then it is ABSOLUTELY worth your trouble. I enjoyed this title immensely, despite the frustrations with the technical difficulties. I would even start the game over again right this minute if it weren't for the fact that I have so many other games that I want to play.   IN CLOSING:  I loved this game, and if it weren't for the technical problems that I encountered, it would be my favorite of the series. As it stands, I rank them as follows: Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum, and then Arkham Origins. Definitely a MUST-play!   I am Batman... I am the Night! ",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"At this moment in time, the game is broken, and not just a normal broken, but broken in a way that some people will find it very unenjoyable.

I have a 2gig GTX 960, it's obviously the biggest regret of my rig so far but I'm waiting for the next line of GPU's to come out before I waste my money on a 980ti. I have stuttering when turning the camera, when driving, etc. It's crazy bad even on the lowest settings. I do get 60 fps in a majority of areas, but as soon as I turn the camera or drive it dips in the 40s. It's sad because the game stutters even worse when I lock it back at 30 fps.

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"*Edit* 2015/09/04 My game actually runs worse post-patch...  First off, this is an inexcusably terrible port, especially from a developer whose budget vastly exceeds the million dollar mark, I find it ironic that they delayed the Limited Edition due to quality issues yet were perfectly content with releasing this broken, incomplete mess as it is on PC. The FPS is locked to 30 by default and suffers dips to the single digits when moving fast due to what I suspect to be a texture streaming issue, while there is an option to unlock it, it's best left on as it creates instabilities and the constant drops from 60 FPS to 10 - 20 FPS make for an annoying experience. I hope the Steam refund is used in wide effect, this trend of games launching in such state is getting rather tiresome.   The game itself is mediocre - featuring the same overly simple, monotonous combat from the previous installments and most of the same gadgets only this time you get access to the Bat Mobile, which does create a few cool moments but soon becomes extremely repetitive when you're forced to use it on nearly every mission in the game. The voice acting is horrible, beyond the 'so bad it's good' mark, it comes across as tired and uninspired where the characters in-game sound like they care little for the current situation with a stiff, almost sarcastic tone and hardly ever fits the mood of the moment at hand. The world features some nice design choices and looks pretty good in my opinion, the aesthetics of the game are not too shabby either.   The plot is laughably bad, this is lower grade writing defined - not that I care much for it in most games, but in a game like this that's heavily narrative driven it's... bad. The characters are pretty dull and generic too, along with their cringe worthy dialogue that makes for plenty of moments where you're likely to let out a sigh, it's as if they read a few comic books, watched some of the movies &amp; cartoons and took the cheesiest, most generic lines they could find and threw them in there.  While this is essentially the same Batman game as before and you're likely to find some enjoyment out of it if you don't mind the monotony of being forced to use the Batmobile for a good portion of the game and if you really liked the other ones and are a fan of Batman in general, I'd recommend waiting atleast a year for them to iron this mess out and get a version inclusive with the swamp of DLCs planned - I,myself, will never buy anything from this studio again, their attitude is awful and they clearly shafted PC gamers to the bottom of the pedestal, like most AAA devs of this era do.",-1,1

My system excceds the recommended specs...all drivers are current and it still crashes 9/10 times it tries to move from a cinematic into game play. Rocksteady's response to my inquires was 'We regret to inform you that at this time we are no longer supporting or adding material to the PC release.' So Rocksteady can kiss my business good bye. They have had a year to fix this...they put it back up for sale and the game is still broken. Don't buy it. Give your money to someone that makes games that are working on release and offers support to their customers.  Update: Finally got this game working on 9-25-16. Took a lot of efforts going through forums on steam and on other 3rd party sites. I appreciate the input of so many commentators below. That said I stand buy the review and the recommendation. A player should not have to resort to the player forums, mods and the fan community to get a product to work. It is poor customer support, planning and product management. Rocksteady provided no help in their communications. Steam support actually refered me to more resources and they followed up. Rocksteady dropped the ball on this product. I called them on it. I stand by it.  Update 2: 10-18-16 After months of trying to log on to WBPlay Forums to get the Zur En Arrh skin I brought up the problem in the WB Forums. Was their reaction to provide support? Was it to unlock the skin for me? Was it to apologize for their poopr infrastructure and almost 60 day delay in being able to access content I was promised? None of the above. Instead they banned my account and access the the WBPlay site for life. Not just Arkham Knight but ALL WBPlay forums, community access and other information.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good. Yet, it's so incredibly easy.  Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective. Dark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you. It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.  Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.  In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.  Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying 'clunk' sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!  The world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that 'adventure' experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.  The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.  Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called 'Humanity' to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to 'invade' the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.  Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of 'honor' code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What 'honor' or 'etiquette' should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.  Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.  In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years. My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay. It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong.  This game is not a bully or a menace. It is not unfair. Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard. Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues. Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple. You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another. The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up. Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first.   Now you can give up whenever you want. Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time. Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove. The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed. He's teaching you by showing, not by telling. He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead. Don't fight it. He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it. Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is hard. That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned. I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use. We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen. We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome. We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death. If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player. I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator. If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless. Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience. If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up.  Another claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true. The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect. We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper. The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design. We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges. The way the lore is delivered reflects this. Does this mean that it is light on story? Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives.   Dark Souls is/was a bad pc port. It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live. DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues. There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue. Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer.   Subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games. Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction. Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind. I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles. I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to PC. I've since played through seven more times with another three characters. I suppose you could call me a fan of the series. I obviously recommend it.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself. Death is not failure, but it is common.  First, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it. I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar). I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around. I had to buy a controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&amp;K combo didn't work out. The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive. All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it.  And then I actually PLAYED the game.  And it's amazing.  Let's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own. Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons. Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game. I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die. It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival. Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits. The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out. It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head. Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing.  I don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault. I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it. This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard. Of COURSE you're getting punished. If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment.  In summary, though, this game is not for casuls. This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base. This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person. Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first. Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I was always afraid to play dark souls. I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game. And I went through all of that. And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played. And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game.  I could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game. I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it. If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will. Its almost a guarentee. You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game. And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works. There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design.  I think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses. If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine. But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated. And admittedly I did that for a long time. But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think.  Dark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point. You owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation.     Buy At Full Price    ",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"In this review I'll try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game. (°ロ°)☝   ♦ The difficulty ♦ The graphics ♦ The gameplay ♦ The lore    ♦ The difficulty  First of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty. This game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death. I often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies.  It's not true.  This game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can 'easily' kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck). I said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).  It's a challenge.  No more words needed.   ♦ The graphics  The graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful. Maybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty. The textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly. But the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect. The light is not that well done but when it's dark, for God's sake, it's really dark. Not dark like 'meh, i can barely see stuff', dark like 'Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?'.   ♦ The Gameplay  This game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps. It gives only two directed suggestions: -'In Lordran, level up and kindle at bonfires'  -'Ring two bells and GTFO' STOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses. Every single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon. Don't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without estus (potions). This game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can convoke players. Last but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the souls and the humanity you had. You can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara souls.   USE A CONTROLLER.     ♦ The lore  Some people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on. But items, ambientations, enemies, will scream out loud what happened and what is going on. Quoting the director of the game:  'A well designed world could tell its story in silence.'   Watch  THIS  video. NOW.   Like a moth, fluttering towards a flame   10/10",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls isn’t an especially hard game, it’s just a lot harder than most mainstream games today. I like to say it’s an early 90’s action RPG with modern 3D graphics and controls, in every aspect.  The central thing that sets Dark Souls apart (as well as Demon’s Souls before it) is that it actually tries to respect the player’s intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices today’s mainstream games adopt. It doesn’t hold your hand. It doesn’t constantly prod you in the right direction. It doesn’t spoon-feed you the storyline. It won’t try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do. The developers at From Software aren’t even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game. Dark Souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do.  In terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player I personally would say Dark Souls is about in line with most Super NES games. It actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic Mega Man and Mega Man X games. While playing you have to accept the fact that you’re going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation. Most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game, but From Software doesn’t care.  Dark Souls is definitely a punitive game. When you die you lose “souls,” a resource representing both your experience points and currency, which you get one chance to retrieve. Checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game. Though you can save and quit literally anywhere, the game auto-saves after pretty much any action, so every single decision you make, big or small, is final. Many people have called Dark Souls the ultimate example of “tough but fair,” in video games.  Even the tutorial manages to be at once smooth, enticing, and a bit challenging. The first time I tried Demon’s Souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls (which are basically the same in Dark Souls). It’s a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand, (on an Xbox 360 pad) the B button representing dodge, and the management of a stamina meter. The rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground, immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper. The tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesn’t ever stop you to talk your ear off.  Dark Souls even manages to stand out among action RPGs by nailing a unique balance between RPG stat-building and action game skill. It’s not a twitch game at all -- its action combat is rather slower than most games, requiring good timing, patience, and attention to enemy patterns (a lot like old school game but in 3D). As an RPG Dark Souls is about watching equipment stats (your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game), resistances, and a few other base stats, but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills. In fact, with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior, it’s possible to beat Dark Souls with a level 1 character.  Another part of Dark Souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design. It takes many hours to realize it, but Dark Souls is basically a 3D Metroidvania. Its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal, each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design. Oftentimes a “checkpoint” in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didn’t even know was there.  One of my favorite things about Dark Souls though -- what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten, is carry a dark sense of mystery. Its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity. It’s a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like Ultima Underworld. From Software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction.  Dark Souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself, never really giving you much of any clues as to what you’ll encounter next -- only just enough warning for ever-vigilant players. At the same time paying attention to environments, item descriptions, and NPCs starts to reveal what’s going on in the story as well as some of the game’s lore. Things like this are pretty much the game’s only storytelling devices.  Those environments show Dark Souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics. The game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles PS2-era games, but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies. It’s all medieval fantasy, but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy. Dark Souls obviously doesn’t pull its looks from other RPGs, but rather straight from actual medieval architecture, clothing, armor design, and fables.  Dark Souls isn’t a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the PC port’s rushed development cycle. Unless Durante’s DSfix is applied, the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second, and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended. Furthermore, your performance is highly dependent on your CPU’s base clock speed. If it’s under 3.0GHz you’re going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads you’re running.  Dark Souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation, but if you’re tired of AAA games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually let’s you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment, Dark Souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values.",1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is an incredible experience that challenges you in many ways. It can be difficult, but outside of one mid-game boss fight, it never seems ridiculous. Dungeons are extremely well-designed. I have played a lot of RPGs in my life, and this seriously has some of the most interesting, huge, incredible set of crafted dungeons I've ever seen. In addition to this, the game is beautiful, and the boss battles are intense and memorable.  For the uninitiated, Dark Souls is a combat-oriented RPG. The world is beautifully designed and rendered. The aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous, breath-taking vistas to eerie, haunted locales. The sparse NPCs are laconic, have their own agendas, and come and go despite your desires. There are no random, unimportant NPCs in this game. The world of Dark Souls is dangerous, mysterious, and lost. The game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps.  That said, this game can be very frustrating. I die a lot. I have fallen off cliffs. I have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character. I have been killed by other players repeatedly. I have been poisoned. I have been ambushed.  So is it fun? Yeah, I think so. There is something exciting about exploring your way through a booby-trapped fortress that would give Indiana Jones a run for his money. It is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness, beat him to a pulp, and walk away with his magic ring. It's exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when you've come way too far to go back, but don't want to dare fate and push ahead. It's exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you. This game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes.  I recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.  I really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I was a bit afraid of trying this game because of its reputation of being difficult. After 200+ hours of playing, I think that yes, it's challenging and it will test your patience (first time in Sen's  funhouse  Fortress) but it's not as difficult as some people make it seem.  What I liked: - Melee combat - I usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun. - Gameplay - The pace of the game play is on the slower side, and involves a lot of trial and error. You'll die quickly if you try to play it hack-and-slash style. The more you die, the more you learn. - Level design - Interconnected areas, hidden areas, shortcuts. Sen's funhouse :p - Loading screens - Only a few loading screens (when loading your save, when you die and respawn, and when using fast travel). - Skippable cutscenes - Most cutscenes are skippable. - Visuals - It doesn't have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful. - Weapons - There are a lot of weapons in this game, with different movesets for each kind of weapon. - Armor design - This is usually my pet peeve in RPGs. I was surprised that a Japanese game had practical-looking armors, and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many RPGs. There are ridiculous-looking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them. - Jolly cooperation :D  Meh: - The trek from bonfire (spawn point) to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times. - No pause (probably because of multiplayer). Not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards. During boss fights, if you have to take care of something for a short while, you can't pause so you'll have to repeat from the start. - Lag during invasions (fixed by Alt+F4 :p )  Other stuff: - Using a controller is highly recommended - Use DSfix to fix the resolution, remove 30 fps lock, use texture mods, etc. - If you've seen 'Edge of Tomorrow', that's basically how Dark Souls plays like.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Short version : One of the best RPG games EVER made, that's coming from a gamer who's played over a hundred RPG titles in his life.  Dark Souls - 9.5/10  [I myself put in around 400+ hours on my PS3 version until people stopped playing Dark Souls on the PS3, that's when I bought the PC version and the rest is history.]  Long Version : Darks Souls..... so much to say about the title. It's not your average day game, that's for sure. The game throws the player in a very difficult world, not just by gameplay standards, but plotwise as well. The narrative is played in such a way that it's never speaking to the player, but rather to your character, it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it, only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining, and from then on, you're completely on your own for the rest of the 50+ hour journey. Unless you get a co-op partner or go through some guides on the internet.  Dark Souls boasts a great online system that originates from it's spiritual predecessor Demon Souls, one that was revolutionary when it came out. You can invade other people's world, like literally, their own game world, just like they can invade yours, but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances. You can also allow other people to summon you to their world, so you can help them fight tough bosses, or protect them from other players who invaded their world.  Dark Souls has covenants, which are ingame clans. Different covenants has different attributes, you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses, abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it. Dark Souls' online system is great, but it's connectivity issues are still poor as of today, but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun!  The story of the game won't be told to you directly, you won't get cutscenes where NPC's tell you stuff and action scenes occur.... no, that's now how it is. You'll learn the story through character dialogues, item informations, the appearence of an area and boss battles. Yes, boss battles gives you a great deal of story, you learn why their fighting you, aside from demons, no enemy in the game is actually a villian, they're fighting you for their own reasons.  Dark Souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay. A lot of people say that the gameplay is broken, but if you play it for some time, you'll understand how beautifully crafted it really is. You can perform so many movesets, no other game that I've played has such a thing. To kick, to jump attack, to jump, to parry, backjump, to roll, to attack with your right or left hand, to heavy attack with your right or left hand, to block, to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage, to backstab, to use bows, crossbows, magics, apply magical effect on your weapon and many more. So many elements, it's literally the perfect gameplay for me, it feels so real, and so technical. When you defeat a tough enemy or a boss, you feel like the best dude there ever lived, like you've achieved human perfection. That's how satisfying the gameplay really is. It's simply magnificent, totally worth buying, truly worth playing.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"- Personal Rating - 'Must own Instant Classic' - Traditional Rating - '9.5/10'  This game... currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and Video Games in general. Dark Souls, storywise is what's considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a 'Find it Yourself' and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in it's design, it drops you in a huge expansive world, where you, as the 'Chosen Undead' are tasked to braving the world of Lordran to either save or destroy an age.  I personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever, and is one that's mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards. The game starts you out at an Asylum as you escape from it, the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from (at the time being) as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead, enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the Character Creator. What you do with this information here will carry out through the ENTIRE game. As soon as you defeat the Boss and escape the Asylum, your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go, you're given a goal - Ring two bells, and that's it, it's up to you to find out why and what for.  The game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses (this also holds true to bosses). There are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them. After you kill an enemy, you collect their 'Souls' (that save as the game's style of currency) that is used to not only level up, but to buy items, weapons, etc as well - enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be. The world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further re-inforces the 'Figure it yourself' type of story; pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on, from villages, to rotting bridges, to an area mostly populated by dragons, to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim - there's no shortage of level design to be found here, and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so, as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way - as you make your way to the nearest bonfires (checkpoint system for the game).  The leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything. What the game won't tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat (50 generally) those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways. These stats are essential to building a certain character, similar to an MMO. By leveling up a stat like, Intelligence for example, you'll be building up a Mage, like building up a stat like Strength or Dexterity will most likely build a melee style character. There's no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day.  As far as the Online Multiplayer goes - this game has one of the most inventive systems in place. If your character is undead, you cannot summon other people (or NPC Phantoms) to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded. Invasion is, in my opinion, what makes a game like Dark Souls the game it is. Invasion is when another player (and in some cases an NPC) comes into your world sporting a dark red aura (in certain other cases a Dark Blue aura) and attempt to kill you, as well as you can invade another player's world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity. Humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general. Humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire, while 'Human' is when you can be invaded or invade others, and summon other players or NPCs.  There's a bunch more details to this game I could go on and on about, but if you're reading this, you're most likely either looking to continue supporting Dark Souls or buy it. If you haven't bought this game, and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance, get this game. It sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons, it's a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls, perhaps more than any other game on the market, is preceded by a reputation. From its ultra-imposing, ultra-intimidating bosses, to the alienating community mantra of 'git gud', to the game's own subtitle of 'Prepare To Die', the message seems clear: this game is hard, and you're going to die. A lot. The reality is, thankfully, quite a bit more complex than that. While Dark Souls seems destined to make an appearance on nearly every 'most difficult games' list ever compiled, to place a disproportionate focus on some sort of perceived insatiable sadism is to sell the game far, far short of what it truly has on offer. Consider the whole picture, and it's little surprise that the Souls series has essentially spawned an entirely new subgenre unto its own.  At its core, Dark Souls is a game that demands to be respected. Every step you take, every swing of your sword, every swig of life-giving Estus is subject to an assessment of risk. New players quickly learn that while sharp reflexes don't hurt, it's caution, calculation, and preparation that make the difference between 'VICTORY ACHIEVED' and the infamous 'YOU DIED'. Button-mashing and face-rolling will only see you sent back to the last bonfire, but with a bit of patience and a cool head you'll realize that towering demons and seven-headed serpents aren't quite so scary after all.  For as much respect as this game requires of the player, it returns it in kind. Save for a select portion or two of the game where it seems to momentarily forget that it's not actually part of the Uncharted series, fights are fair and frustration is shockingly minimal. While I won't go so far as to suggest that 'no death is ever the game's fault', I will say that this game emanates a general ethos of measured punishment. Believe it or not, Dark Souls honestly  does  want you to succeed. It goes to great lengths to ensure that with enough observation, adaptation, and perseverance you will always have at your disposal every tool necessary to do so, even when your situation initially looks hopeless.  In addition to its punishing-yet-rewarding gameplay, there really is a lot to love about Dark Souls. For a game of few conversations and fewer cutscenes, its lore is surprisingly deep. While some exposition does exist as a more direct means of world-building, much of it must be pieced together through a combination of lore-bearing items and reasonable inferences made about the world around you. Much of the game follows a similar philosophy of content delivery, where there is always something new for particularly-astute players to discover. To this point, the game is perfectly content to allow even entire portions of the game world to be passed right by if a player doesn't happen to stumble upon them by chance (or by wiki).  Level design (for as much as 'levels' exist at all in this game) is another area in which Dark Souls stands head-and-shoulders above the competition. Whereas many games seem to be satisfied with horizontal expanses of isolated chunks of content, Dark Souls has crafted an intricately-interconnected and startlingly-vertical world. During the course of my own playthrough, it was not uncommon for me to be suddenly taken aback at the realization that the passage I had just discovered had opened up an alternative route back to a previously-visited location, often in a surprising and pleasantly unexpected way.  Enemy design is varied and interesting. Few games have so effectively inspired within me such a mixture of wonder, awe, and intimidation as this game has with its enemies, especially with its area bosses. Combine this with the fact that each boss has its own dedicated (and often hauntingly-beautiful) audio track playing in the background as you take them on, and boss fights tend to be as mesmerizing as they are terrifying.  The way that Dark Souls implements its multiplayer is particularly interesting. Rather than a discrete mode of play, multiplayer is integrated directly into the core game. Players broadcast messages to the greater community by placing them into the environment, like graffiti on a wall. Through certain actions, with the aid of specific items, a player may even find themselves directly crossing paths with other players themselves (for better, or for worse), without even leaving their own play session. As far as I'm aware, all of this is (or at least was at one point) completely unique to Dark Souls.  Now, because I feel as though I've done nothing but gush about this game since my fingers hit the keyboard, I must note that there are, of course, flaws. As I mentioned, there are a few encounters in this game that feel rushed and cheap, and some that feel as though they would be more at home in a 'high-octane' action-adventure game. A number of enemies are obvious near-carbon copies of one another with differing coats of paint. Some latter segments of the game suffer from level design that just doesn't stand up to what you've come to expect of it by those points. While the game's systems are generally refreshingly hands-off with regards to mechanical indoctrination, they can at times feel unnecessarily opaque, to the point where you'll be tempted to keep your web browser open to the Dark Souls wiki in the background while you play.  Finally, because no Dark Souls PC review would be complete without this mention, some light third-party modding is borderline-necessary here. The ubiquitous DSFix is such for a reason, as the game constitutes a pretty lackluster PC port. Frame rate improvements, a wider array of video resolutions, and a number of other graphical and performance-related options are likely to add immensely to one's enjoyment of this fantastic game.  What else can I say about this game? What else has already been said a thousand times over? If this game sounds at all intriguing to you, especially if you're somebody who has shied away due to its menacing persona, I'd urge you to try it anyway. With a bit of 'can do' attitude, you may surprise yourself at your ability to push through a steep learning curve to uncover an experience that makes you feel rewarded in ways that most other games seem almost afraid to do. Play this game, and you may find that most other games just don't  quite  do it for you anymore.  If you've found yourself on-the-fence about purchasing, give Dark Souls a fair shot - believe it or not, it'll do the same for you.  To anybody who enjoyed this review, consider checking out the following commentary video by Matthewmatosis. It's six-and-a-half hours long, but I found it quite informative and insightful, and it inspired my own review pretty heavily.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls has a reputation for difficulty. Git gud, they say. But it's not that Dark Souls is necessarily difficult, more that it has a steep learning curve. It can be intimidating for newcomers, as it was for me when I first played it. I got as far as Gaping Dragon and hit what I thought was a brick wall. So I shelved it for nearly two years.  With the release of Dark Souls 3, I thought I needed to give the original another chance. Boy, am I glad that I did. This time I had encouragement, and some determination. Again I struggled at the beginning, 'f*ck this game!' being uttered on more than one occasion. But then it suddenly clicked. I don't know what it was, perhaps I genuinely started to get better at the game, perhaps I upgraded my first weapon, but I know that by the time I encountered Gaping Dragon again, I knew - this time - that I would succeed. First attempt. Fist pump! That feeling when you beat something you'd considered a massive difficulty spike, there's nothing quite like it, and Dark Souls serves them up on a regular basis. It gives you such a sense of achievement, it's like a drug.  But it's not all about combat. Dark Souls rewards exploration. Not just with trinkets, but with real, tangible benefits. Those 'holy crap, I can't believe I just found this awesome thing!' kind of benefits. It's a remarkable game, the level design is inspired (ok, there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little 'tacked on'), the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent, and it grabbed me so hard I could think of little else for the few weeks I was playing it.  Absolutely grab dsfix, which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps. It's easy to implement. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, it's almost a requirement, that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face. Even now (May 2016) there's still plenty of multiplayer activity, people willing to help, messages to guide you, and the occasional invader to challenge you. It just feels right.  Gush, gush, gush, yes I know, but I don't care because Dark Souls really is that good... once it grabs you.  What? Oh. Yeah, ok. I should, shouldn't I? Ok, just because it's you, Dark Souls...

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is an action role playing game, developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games, releasing in 2011 on the console market, and 2012 on the PC. This is the second game in the “Souls” series, the original game “Demon’s Souls” was never released on the PC format. The series is set in a dark fantasy universe.   Game play in Dark Souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play. Whilst this is true, the game’s difficulty is also fair at the same time, with the game relying primarily on the player’s skill, rather than how they are geared and what level they are. At the start of the game you get your character creation segment, you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like – choosing options such as sex, appearance, name and class. You play the game in a third person perspective, you have access to tons of different weapons, and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety. Weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas, which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting Souls; this is the game’s currency system as well as experience points. The combat system in Dark Souls is one of the game’s most positive features, with system that is easy to grasp, but pretty hard to become a master of. With a lot of enemies having different attack routines, you are never quite sure how you should react, should you dodge this attack? Should I parry this attack? Am I just outright dead? Dark Souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know, you will die….a lot.   Graphically, Dark Souls upon released looked like your typical PS3 release. By today’s standards it would be considered very dated. Thankfully with the game being on PC, we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game ten-fold. If you aren’t a fan of modding games, then the graphical side of Dark Souls may be something which puts you off a little, with low quality textures, and an even worse resolution cap in place. With mods not only can you make the game look beautiful, but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want, as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps. Dark Souls has some really good sound tracks too, and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters; something just doesn’t sound right about them. Whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie; I am not sure, but there is something very different about the voice acting in Dark Souls.   The game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in. There are no loading screens, or “levels”. If you have the balls, you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game, that’s one of the games really difficult parts – making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order. Throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies, equipment vendors, and loot. The game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route.   As you can see from my play time on Dark Souls, 73 hours is a lot. In fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game. Your first play through Souls will probably take you about 30+ hours, depending on how you are with the combat system. Beating this game is no easy feat, and when you finish it, you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so. Achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand, with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully. There is also a large amount of replay ability factored into Dark Souls. You can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience, as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class.   Technically, on PC Dark Souls released in a poor state; thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed. First of all, don’t even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights. The most important mod you will need to make Dark Souls playable on PC is DSFix which can be downloaded here -  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?  – The mod is very easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod.   Dark Souls is a real test of a gamer’s skill and patience. It is difficult, but fair at the same time. If you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there, Dark Souls will be for you. I had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it. If you want the full experience of struggle, try the game without the use of wikis or guides! Dark Souls will not be for everyone, and that is fine, but I strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action RPG genre to attempt to beat this game. The game’s regular retail price on Steam is £19, 99 – whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012, you are getting a monster of a title. Sale season has been known to bring Dark Souls down to less than £5 though.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"For the past year or two, gaming lost it's touch to me. I found myself starting up games, and getting bored within 10 minutes, even new games I just recently purchased, I thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old. But still, I continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling I had when I was 14. The feeling of deep immersion, losing myself within the game, wanting to find out more, and improve myself. Then, this game happpened.  I heard about Dark Souls first about 1 year ago, mid 2015. Nothing about it seemed interesting to me, I heard it was incredibly hard, the story was confusing, and I felt like gaming was past me. So about 6 months pass, and I hear about the hype of Dark Souls 3, something about this series now seems intriguing, I still pass it off as something I'm not going to ever play though. Then it comes out, I see all these youtube videos about it, people going crazy about how amazing it is... alright I've got to at least try one of these games, where do I start?  $60 for a game I don't even think I will like? No thanks. Alright lets see number two, $55 for a game I'm not sure about? No thanks, once again. Ah, lets check the first. After a few minutes of pondering, I decide f**k it, I'm buying it, and here starts my journey.  I'm new, I don't know what the hell is going on, but this game, something about it, every time I die, I want to go further, figure out how to fix what I did wrong last. It's not Skyrim, it's not some boring repetive game, it's just... different, nothing like I've ever experienced. Then after a while, a few hours past, wait what? I'm actually... getting into a game again, I want to play more. I want to improve my character so I can kill that Black Knight and get whatever is behind him, I want to finally find a new cool piece of armour, I want to figure out what the f**k is actually happening in this world and where the story is going.  This, is a f**king game done right. Just buy it, try it out, you wont regret it. Ignore all the ♥♥♥♥ about people saying it's insanely difficult scaring you away, that is exactly what makes this game fun. It's a breath of fresh air to me, I'm only 5 hours in, and can't wait to keep playing the rest of this series.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,Probably the best game ever.,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation. There’s a wildly prevalent belief the game’s extremely hard. People presume the developers, From Software, sat down and looked at the history of videogames, cherry-picking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration, only to cause perspiration for others. Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins and Battletoads would likely be in there. In there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than, well, than anything you have ever played before. This just isn’t the case. It’s just misunderstood.   You see, dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of Firelink Shrine through Darkroot Garden and onto Blighttown is part of the game mechanics, part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve. You move a few feet, meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso. You try again, make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure, this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you. You think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option, or maybe a long-range effort if so endowed. You’ve learned what not to do. Now you teach yourself what to do. It probably still isn’t enough. A third, fourth, thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature. Each time you died you were that little bit wiser, that little bit stronger. Regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable. There was no stopping, no waiting. Just the desperate need to keep on trying, learning and eventually succeeding. It was incredibly hard work and around the corner there’s more to do, different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover. You have no idea if you’re going in the right direction, the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger. The compulsion is there though. It’s not a hard game, see, it’s just a game with a deep, long-lasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process, rather than the end as in the majority of titles today.   Dark Souls is essentially a third-person Elder Scrolls game for the self-hating. Like Bethesda's masterful series, Dark Souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet, classes to choose from, factions to join, magical spells to learn, a huge world to explore, and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find. But unlike the Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls doesn't reward your failures with generous helpings of EXP and leveled-up abilities, and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving. Dark Souls kills you over and over, and then punishes you for dying. If you want to make the game a little easier, grind to improve your character. If you don't like it, go play Skyrim with all the other wimps.  At its core, Dark Souls is a game about animations. You need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to, and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion. If you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you, you'll probably get hit. If you want to take a swig from your health flask, you need to know that your character will take his sweet time, leaving himself vulnerable. And when you get knocked down, your character won't scramble back to his feet; he'll lie there for a second, just tempting bad guys to move in.  You need to take each enemy type, dissect their patterns, and figure out what works through trial and error. It might be as simple as blocking, strafing, and attacking when you get the chance. Or, you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them, or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield can't handle, or use a certain type of magic. You're prevented from button-mashing by your stamina meter, which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up. The upside: When you finally get a hard part right, you feel… well, not good so much, but relieved.  Of course, there's more to an action-RPG than just the action. Killing enemies earns you souls, which you can spend (if you don't lose them first) to improve your many attributes—and RPG progression is the only way to make this game less difficult. You'll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor. You also earn a resource called 'humanity,' which makes you a little less undead, allows you to return to your human form, and offers a variety of other perks, such as the ability to 'kindle' a bonfire. (Bonfires are this game's checkpoints, and they refill your health flask; kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you.)  The visuals are well-crafted, for the most part. Dark Souls offers impressive environments, detailed and frightening enemies, and fluid animations. The creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere, too.  As for the controls, they're easy to get used to, but you'll definitely want a controller. There is a default keyboard configuration, but it's incredibly clumsy, and the developers don't even pretend there's a chance you might use it—all the on-screen instructions pertain to the gamepad. (No, you don't 'Press A' to pick up items when you're using a WASD movement setup.)  There's ten hours of new content in the 'Prepare to Die Edition' as well, making it the definitive version of Dark Souls There's a new chapter of the story, including fresh areas, bosses, enemies, and NPCs. As I said above, most players probably won't finish the game—which was up to 100 hours long to begin with—so it's not that big of a deal that this version has more of it. But if you're a hardcore Dark Souls fan, or if you're confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game, the Prepare to Die Edition is the way to go.    A Must Play ",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition," Dark Souls  changed me, as a player and as a person. But changed me a lot more as a gamer. I want to review this masterpiece but I'm afraid mere words won't do it justice.   Dark Souls  is an RPG based on a world where humanity lost the right to a final rest, as they become undead when death is upon every and each player to adventure itself out of the Asylum. There are plenty of information about the lore and such around the web, but I still feel the need to say that each story has a side, and between legends and fables, it's up to the player to uncover the truth... But what truth can be found, if not within our selves? This is the perspective that I have, and I'ts remarkable that to each, their own. Each player must accomplish his own journey to his own path and conclusion.  Dark Souls  is an open game, not only in design, but in the path's of the lore, where there are plenty of clues and perspectives to guess upon.  Even with such rich detail and character personality, it's very unique the way you'll enjoy them, therefore I must focus on something that everyone share as common belief; The amazing level design, worthy of genius appraisal. The areas, from Undead Burg - a city collapsed by despair and plague, to Darkroot Garden - a fearful and mysterious woods, to even the glorious Anor Londo - A beautiful large city covered by the incandescent sun. Among many other's where the design remains bound to a rule of commitment: All areas must be connected, and they generally are through a well placed shortcut. All levels look like a new challenge, but they end up making a certain sense where the player can only admire how well done they are. Such a logical and practical path makes advances in the game so much fun and entertaining. Each area is covered with a atmosphere that marks the player, and it marked me in ways I can't entirely describe... It's an overwhelming feeling acquired by the details of light, flora, and even sounds.  As everything above wasn't enough, we have another well common appreciation; the gameplay.  Dark Souls  is in my opinion, the game with the best character movement of all times. I know it's pretty arrogant to claim this, but I never experienced anything so complete, so responsive, so detailed, so so good. Of course, there are issues at times, but this is a game after all, it's not a science.  Dark Souls  is an abstract game when comes to in-game beliefs and theories, but it's almost pure science when moving and fighting. The controls feel natural and extremely responsive. Attacking, blocking, parrying, casting magic, everything makes me feel so special... even more when enemies are down. Anyone that enjoys defeating Boss's will love  Dark Souls , and those who don't will start to!  The game being hard isn't a lie, it's tough, but I found it to be more obtuse when come to use specific items. I believe this is no issue, as old games use to be like this, especially a game made for consoles where players use a controller. It's not an issue to me like I stated. Using the correct set up and leveling up on the right attributes can make you extremely strong and break the game, but even so, I found this to be the real challenge. Enemies are vast and committed to making you suffer, but this brings me to another important thing that make  Dark Souls  one of the best games ever... The community. I never in my life experienced such a strong, loyal and helpful community, like the  Dark Souls  fans. It's impressive, how steam forums are filled with such kind users and ready to help everyone. This to me is fascinating, because I don't think  Dark Souls  can be hard anymore, not when there are members dedicated to help and assist others. Marvelous!  To end, I must say  Dark Souls  really changed me, it made me earn resistance, patience and made me respect my foes, but mostly, my own problems and life struggles. I made friends which I still talk to, and overall I feel I earn so much from this game... I can't stress enough how  Dark Souls  really are one of my favorite games of all times.  Thank you From Software, and thank you, everyone that helped me improve in this fantastic game, and teach me the ways of the sun!",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition is the latest installment in a series of family games by critically acclaimed developer From Software. In it, you take on the role of a young Italian painter by the name of Adriano Abato, on his quest to restore color to the world and solve the mystery of why it was lost to begin with. Adriano is joined by his talking pet dog, Francesco, who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns. Francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor, however, and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help Adriano return color to the world.  Gameplay (8/10) The goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush. The more of the world that is restored this way, the closer to solving the mystery Adriano gets. While it is not necessary to repaint 100% of the world, there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so.  The gameplay is split into four phases. In the first phase, Adriano and Francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors. It's up to the player to decide where to go first, but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others. Decide for yourself what you feel capable of, but try to challenge your creative spirit!  In the second phase, Adriano must find the Three Prime Colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings. The three different Colors are Yellow, Blue and Red. Yellows will usually aid Adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun, but in some cases Adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first. Blues can be troublesome, particularly if Adriano hasn't restored a lot of churches yet. In most cases they will give Adriano a puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which depends on how much of the world's color has already been restored. The most troublesome Color by far is Red. The Reds will often say mean-spirited things to poor Adriano and try to ruin his paintings. They can be difficult to deal with, but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from Francesco, Adriano will eventually be able to prevail.  In the third phase, Adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world. Here, accuracy, speed and the number of colors collected is important. If Adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world, and if he is too slow the Colors might get impatient and escape again.  The fourth phase is only unlocked after Adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the world's color. I won't spoil the details of this phase, but it's quite intense!  There is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible. There are some connectivity issues on the PC version, but with a bit of patience it shouldn't be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun.  I give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay, which is both fun and addictive. The competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting, and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world.   Story (7/10) Prepare to Dye does not have a very complex storyline, but it doesn't need one, either. It's a family game for casual painting fun, and the plot reflects this. It's simple enough that a child can grasp it, but even adults will appreciate the tale of Adriano in the monochrome world. The twist at the end will also likely surprise most players, even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game. This is only obvious in retrospect, however.  I give the story a 7/10, because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done. It suits the game, and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously. It's a story anyone can jump into and enjoy.   Characters (6/10) The primary characters are Adriano and Francesco. Adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile. His optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world, and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world. Francesco, his talking dog, is similar to his owner in many ways, but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over Adriano's head. Nonetheless, the player won't be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes.  The personalities of the Colors are not particularly complicated, and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above. There are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning, but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to would-be players.  While the characters are quite endearing, I can't give this section more than 6/10. There is little in the way of character development, and there isn't a lot of character variation.   Controls: (4/10) Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition was ported from the Nintendo Wii to PC, and as a port it does have some issues. The original game relied heavily on the Wiimote's motion control for the painting parts of the game, and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on PC.  It's difficult to play the game as intended on PC, and many blame the rushed release of the PC version for this. There are mods to fix the controls, but, despite this, I can't really give the game more than a 4/10 for the controls as they are by default. While the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the PC, they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls, rather than rushing the port like they did.   Graphics (7/10) As I already mentioned, the game was ported from the Nintendo Wii, and the port is less than ideal. This can also be seen in the graphics, as the game doesn't support resolutions a PC player would consider acceptable. While this too can be fixed with mods, it should still be considered a problem with the port.  Resolutions aside, the game itself is absolutely gorgeous. The haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world. While the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison, they suit the overall atmosphere of the game. In many ways they resemble characters from a children's picture book.  Despite the issues with resolutions, I give the graphics a 7/10. The low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is, but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous. With mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on Steam.   Sound (8/10) From Software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes, and Prepare to Dye is certainly no exception to this rule. In the monochrome world, the music is somber, but as color is restored to the world, the music grows livelier and more colorful as well. Once color is fully restored, the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment. It's like an auditory representation of the canvas Adriano restored to life.  The voice acting is a bit cheesy, however. The stereotypical Italian accents of Adriano and Francesco get more endearing once you get used to it, but the fact that the Colors and the other NPCs have standard American accents is a bit off-putting.  That said, the voice acting can't pull down the overall sound score too much, as dialogue is not very important in Prepare to Dye. The music speaks more for the game than the voices do, and so I give the game an 8/10 for sound.   Conclusion (7/10) Overall I give this game a 7/10. While it has many issues, it's a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer. I highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I have to admit that I avoided Dark Souls for an unhealthy amount of time. Rarely playing games above the normal difficulty, the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasn't the most compelling. I'm glad I changed my mind though, because I may have had missed out on a game I now consider one of the best of the decade.  The gameplay is fun and engaging. The art, hauntingly beautiful and original. The soundtrack, breathtaking. But what really makes Dark Souls a masterpiece, by perfectly uniting all its elements, is the world of Lordran. Its cohesive design made me question every videogame world I'd experienced up to that point. From the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle, the world's vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow. After transversing the map not too many times, I could - and still can, months after actively playing the game - definitely draw a convincing transcription of it, with all its shortcuts and intersections. In a journey through Lordram, rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused.  Dark Souls has no narrative. There are no quests, maps, or journals. What it has is the world of Lordran. The story is presented to the player through unusual elements. Item descriptions. NPCs - that have their own agenda. And most importantly, through the other main elements of the game: music, visuals, gameplay. You are never given a codex or anything like what most RPGs have. You have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it. Or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses - it's just as fun. As is taking part in the clever and unique co-op and PvP elements. To top it all off, the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched. But that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long.  A must-play if I've ever seen one, Dark Souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is a hard game at first. It's oppresive, it's relentless, it's punishing and it won't hold your hand. You will be confused, and you WILL die. So prepare to die. Yet, as you progress through the game, you'll get the hang of it. After dying time and time again you'll learn how to tell if an enemy is going to attack you and how powerful that attack will be. You'll learn faster routes to get to your objective. And you'll learn to detach yourself from the souls you get. You WILL lose them. The point isn't to constantly grind - the point is to learn. And while a couple hundreds souls will be an awful lot during early game, by the end you can farm tens thousands of them in a couple of minutes. Take your time, be patient. It's mostly about the journey, and the elation you'll feel when overcoming the obstacles - the insurmountable odds against you, the unbreakable barrier. You'll die and then you'll learn and then you will achieve victory. So Praise the Sun!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you. With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion. You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe. you play this game for the journey it takes you on. I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game. If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right.  10/10, hands down.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"See my hours? I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one.  Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you.  After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access. Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates. I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish. After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for. Development is slow, very slow.  PROS: +You will probably spend at least 100&gt; hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth. +Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space). +Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs. +Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations. +7 Starter races that are diverse and unique. +Modding support for this game is well maintained. +(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings. +Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy). +Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others. The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has. +OST is amazing  +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community. Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC. +Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots). +Liquid and Light dynamics are 'realistic' +Supports .ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO) +Boss fights are unique-ish  SEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone) +/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer +/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally +/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working +/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1.0  CONS: - AI can be pretty stupid - The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game. - Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons. (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP) - The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss - APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses. - Penguin crewmates are a pain in the ♥♥♥ - No ship protection in multiplayer* - Besides farming, there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base. - Mining can get boring quickly, especially if you are used to Terraria's systems** - Game has a falloff point where you sit down and go 'well, what next' (but that is quite some time later) - Some mechanics seem halfbaked, where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there (some bad design choices and flaws) - Starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated. - Seriously, the biggest con for this game are just design flaws. Like, the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely. You will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head 'Why didn't they do ___ instead?' - Techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring - Only 6 tiers? Come on, where is the 10 we had before.*** - So what are ship pets for there exactly? They do like to stand in front of my containers. - Options screen needs a bit of a rework (if you need to explain a UI, its not a good UI) - Wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks - Matter Manipulator customization is a joke  *Any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still. People are divided between 'simply party with people you trust' and 'just give us some bloody protection options'. Personally, protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit? EDIT: After some more thought, ship protection options should just be a thing, honestly. The existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are 'not everyone will be a decent or honest person'.  ** Okay lets clear this up: Starbound is NOT a Terraria copy, YES it does have elements and inspired features that Terraria did but honestly, whats the wrong in that? Imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game you've ever played. Terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps.  *** Tiers are an iffy one, they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones; Ranged, Melee and Staffs. On top of that, where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes? They totally disappeared! In a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do - this doesn't just mean a million different blocktype, just give us some more depth and flexibility. (Should clarify, technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one)  Last time i played this game on a server with friends, we didnt mine, explore, pvp, build or do quests. We all sat in a ship and played 'guess the song', if that isn't simultaneously the most concerning (gameplay wise) but coolest thing then what the hell is it.  The game's development could be described as a mix of 'one step forward, two steps back' and 'missed opportunities' because the thing is it's easily playable but frustrating.  (removed score, decided it wasn't a good choice)  Worth the money? YES... Runs on most computers? NO (as of right now, 1.0, which harbors some optimization problems)  Honestly i want to love Starbound i really do. To me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it, but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities  (25/7/16) Top review, didn't expect - gonna add a little more.(also edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings_  If anyone from Chucklefish reads this, what ARE you doing? This game is confusing, because it obviously has potential (and lives up to some of it) but falls short at the silliest of things. Look at some community mods and ideas, people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked. When you make a game it won't be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too. You added skyrails and some other features - hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example, the 'modular' Matter Manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization. I don't want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism, because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms. I would hate for this to be another 'let the modders deal with it' All that being said, good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up, you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i won't discount that.

211820,Starbound,"I last reviewed this in 2014, when the game was in early beta; It was really bad. I've come back now that 1.0 has released to see if the game is better. This review was earlier incomplete during a 1.0 playthrough, but after playing about 70 hours total of the release version, my feelings have not changed, only worsened.  I couldn't even push myself to complete the story; I searched it up, and found it was more dissapointing then i could have expected, making me actually glad I didn't go through it. The rest of the review has been slightly modified, but only slightly.   I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and have been watching it for 5 years. I wanted this game to be great.  So, is it good? is it bad? It's ok.  The game has some value to it now; the building is fairly entertaining, providing a lot of options for furniture, and ways to progress through it with farming/colonies. As well, combat has a good deal of variety, and the bosses are pretty decent. There is a lot of variety in weapon types later in the game. The story missions are pretty good in design, and hold a lot of nice secrets. The fossil collecting minigame is a fun distraction as well.  That's unfortunately where things fall off to being either poor, or outright bad.  The exploration is awful. The biomes are devoid of content minus some rare biome chests, and that's how all of the biomes work. Enter biome, look for chest, hope it has an interesting blueprint. You can't craft anything of note from the biomes until luck does you well. Alongside that there are procedural buildings throughout planets in the form of rooms and dungeons. They are sadly all handmade, meaning you will constantly find the same exact rooms/dungeons while playing. I never went through a biome underground without finding at least 3 of the same exact room; it was often 5 though. As a result of this lack of variety, lack of reward, and really a lack of anything else to look for, exploration dies rapidly. Every planet is mostly the same, and they can be grouped into a few categories; normal planet, ocean, barren, moon, and possibly asteroid.  The story is also terrible. Collect the 6 special artifacts. Done. It's badly written, and the lore is lacking in every way. If you know any of the source material/theme concepts (cavemen for floran, 1984 for apex, aztec/inca for avian, etc), then the lore and story will not branch to any interesting point whatsoever. It all feels very generic.  Weapon generation is also bad. Melee only has damage, firerate, and element, though 2 handed weapons have an extra special attack. Ranged is the same, though it has energy cost as well. There are also staves/wands, but they just change damage into level, a less varying stat. The weapons themselves are nice to use, but the lack of statistical variance means the procedural nature of weapons feels entirely pointless.  Cooking = potions, but there aren't a lot of unique buffs. You can get crew members for your ship, but they aren't useful past the first few tiers, and they otherwise do extremely little.  The toolbar is a mess. Crafting takes time for no apparent reason. Procedural quests send you to the same areas, revealing the way the system works, damaging play experience and providing lackluster repetition. As well, there aren't many actual quest types. Colonist rewards are lacking, and serve only as an alternative to normal play for getting items. As well, the thoughts and traits of colonists actually seem to do nothing in my experience. Character gear options consist of only 4 armor slots, a passive augment, and movement abilities. Customization is thus very limited in terms of character build depth. There aren't any passive gear slots other than the single augment, which are all very basic. Armor is also very lacking; there aren't very many unique sets with most being reskins, and they lack any notable special effects. Not to mention a lot of things from beta, like character customization options and techs, have been removed. And... Well, I could go on.  But after all that, I still don't think the game is terrible, it's just lacking. Badly. I focused on the negatives a lot, but those negatives are a huge part of the game. It's a jack of all trades, master of none kind of ordeal, but its not bad. I wouldn't recommend it unless it is on sale, with exceptions;  If you like animal crossing, or relaxed games about collecting and freeform building (like minecraft mixed in with animal crossing), I think you'll like it, but I'd say pick it up on a sale (say 5$). I was enjoying it for awhile based on the building and fossil hunting, but the rest of the game being so shallow pushed me to leave eventually. As well, I can say with certainty that my enjoyment value dropped rapidly over time; it wasn't even 10 hours in before I was watching youtube videos on the side to distract myself, and I only realised as of my last jump into the game that I wasn't having any fun at all, and it was just time killing due to how long it takes to find things. The game may be long, but it is not deep. I'm sure some will find enjoyment out of this, but it died quickly for me, so I reccomend it only if you are into that type of gameplay, and only on a sale...   As on the slip side, if you want a game about fighting loads of different enemies, finding unique interesting gear, discovering a strange path through progression or exploring exciting places, you are likely going to be very disappointed.  I personally hope for the sake of everyone playing (including myself) that they take the terraria style of updating and add massive swaths of content after release to fix these issues. But that's all I can do; hope. With a similar development time of 5-6 years as terraria has had (due to terraria's year hiatus in 2012), I don't know how much will change at this rate.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"I have played Starbound since its Early Access days, and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox exploration/building genre.  Among the games of its genre, Starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting. Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore “just one more planet”!  In regard of building, Starbound offers one of largest (if not the largest) selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base. It also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many NPC as you like, potentially building a whole town with dozens residents.  And uniquely among its genre, Starbound also has quests like one might expect of a RPG rather than a sandbox building game: a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by NPC in towns or those you've placed in your home or base yourself.  Only one aspect of Starbound is somewhat lacking: combat, or specifically, its difficulty. While you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped (especially at the very start), as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring, you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife. There is some difficulty during boss fights, but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go, and if you expect challenging battles that Terrarria or action games offer, you won't find them in Starbound. Some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge, but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements, like flamethrowers or laser beams, not enemies (in fact, random dungeons often have few to none enemies, and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment).  So, overall, the combat isn't that bad. Just don't expect constant challenge that Terraria or Edge of Space present.  I fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"As someone who's been with Starbound since it entered open beta I can say that This game is, simply put, the best 2-d Sandbox game I've ever played. Picture this: An open, vast universe with 4.something quadrillion planets. each unique in their own ways. There are seven unique playable races, each with a rather vast ammount of lore behind them. I was a bit worried when the developers said they would be adding a storyline, but I'm sure glad they did.  The storyline serves to direct the player and encourage exploration.  There are plenty of weapons to destroy your enemies, with each type having several special stats.   If you like terraria, I highly reccomend this game.   ",1,1

211820,Starbound,"Video games don't exist in a bubble. They don't exist independently from their makers when they're as horrifically unfinished as Starbound.

It has been months without a substantial update for a game that they swore would be released in 2013.  https://i.imgur.com/J1zHrOB.png   On top of that, the developers and moderators have taken to blaming the community for their disappointment.  https://i.imgur.com/M3JBlk8.png   https://i.imgur.com/2zJax3Q.png   They've gone so far as to blame 'vote brigading' for negative Steam reviews.  https://i.imgur.com/91TgOme.png   https://i.imgur.com/YY0UmkZ.png   And of course, they don't want you to get refunds anymore.  https://i.imgur.com/sDGmkYM.png   https://i.imgur.com/egHvklC.png   Don't waste your money.

211820,Starbound,"*TL;DR at the bottom*  Look at the most popular reviews for Starbound and 90% of them are negative even though the overall review is 89% positive. While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.  'Starbound is space Terraria' I do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too 'arcadey' for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).  'Progression is too fast' I got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.  'Interesting things have been removed' I agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes.   ---------------------------------------------------------------- In the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.  TL;DR This game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.  *Edited to clarify my comments about modding.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"This game ended up being surprisingly stale, they cut a massive amount of functioning content that made the game more entertaining, leaving the game with little to stand on compared to it's predecessor or other games in it's genre.  -The weapons are overbalanced and stratified (Magic is a joke, swords can attack in a combo but they get a huge delay afterwards if you do, all melee weapons are around the same level of slow etc.)  -All the interesting flying and movement options are removed, the morphball is the only surviving relic of this stuff, but its useless and is never necessary out of dungeons, and because it lacks any special abilities all you do is move through tiny holes with it. Like how hard would it have been to make it drop a little energy bomb to solve switch puzzles or something?   -The main questline requires you just running through same styled planets and clicking on furniture until you luck out enough to be able to play a dungeon. This could happen on your first try, or only be possible after around 5 hours of gameplay going through towns and planets per quest.  The worst part of this is, the game USED to have interesting and fun content, there used to be more than one reason to go to a moon, there used to be fun flying techs and movement modifications. Weapons used to attack in reasonably diverse ways, and actually good ones used to exist. But all this functional and fun stuff that people enjoyed from early access was taken out.  The only reason I could see, seeing as how all the stuff worked and was finished, is that they wanted these things to 'fit' in the game. Like they wanted the morph ball to be useful, so they designed dungeons and levels with holes small enough to require it. But if say, someone had a jetpack, then any dungeon with a jumping puzzle would be trivialized. Thing is, they still have jumping techs in the game, because the 'meat' of the game is still exploration, so you still can cheat at jumping puzzles, just not to the same extent. So in addition to failing there, this also means that you will never really be able to explore as easily as you want to, because the 'meat' of the game is crippled by the devs inability to work around flight mechanics when designing pointless single item drop puzzle rooms.  This game's skeleton is still a metroidvania, and do you know what metroidvania's AREN'T beloved for, platforming and balanced combat. Few people played Castlevania Symphony of the Night and then commented 'Wow I hate the crissaegrim, magic, and being a bat, climbing this tower while fighting the 800 medusa heads that spawned should have been WAY more tedious for me.'  The changes made seem to reflect the dev's desire to make the game feel 'whole' on release, no loose or frayed ends, and with mechanics at least 'loosely' fitting in with what they've done, but the aspects of the gameplay they sought to preserve by removing content are the least palatable parts of the game, and now were stuck in a crippled snoozefest.  In summary, the devs goofed with their decisionmaking and the game has suffered for it. Its a space game, throw in black hole guns, giant orbital beam cannons, jetpacks, lazer swords that can attack rapidly and in huge arcs, put in nukes that can unexist whole planets, either yielding huge mineral rewards or releashing eldritch terrors I need to fight with my ship. Throw in short range blink teleportation that doesnt suck. Make light not be an Issue for god sakes, I know the monster hunter logic of 'the more we cripple the player the more mechanics we can have to uncripple them' and that makes sense for that game, but were in space for christ's sake, ALL suits would have A light on them, and there's enough other things going on that this wouldn't be missed. Put in high gravity planets, put in planets with poisonous food so you need to stock up. Throw in floating sky cities that hover on high density gas planets(real scientific possibilty for venus colonization). Or at the very least just put BACK in some of the fun that was removed.   The game as it stands is you double jumping around samey rocks while swinging a sword one time a second and clicking alien pots to get to the next dungeon. All other content is either nigh pointless or removed, and what's left is boring.  PS: This is reposted from a community discussion.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet and get straight to the point.  IF you're expecting terraria in space, or some form of a terraria clone in anyway, don't buy the game because you will be disappointed. Starbound is to Terraria as TF2 is to Overwatch. Meaning while they look very similar in visual style and gameplay, they're nothing alike. Stop comparing the two.  If you're expecting something that's a bit more metroidvania styled in gameplay and looking for a game more focused on exploration, this game is for you.  If you have grown bored of terraria and want a new 2D expereience, this game is for you.   If you're not a fan of building and want a home right off the bat, this game is for you.  Do note, the story is great but the scan quests suck. You can skip them via admin commands, there are several guides on how to skip the scanning quests.  I do wish the developers would add more techs, especially ones that enable flight and unique movement boosts, same with vehicles.  If you dislike certain aspects of the game, the workshop is your best friend and usually patches most of the problems you may have. While many vanillaists complain that the workshop shouldn't be responsible for 'fixing things the develeopers failed', they're not really patches or fixes but more so useful tweaks and additions. Do note that anything that add blocks or recipes to the game will break your character once uninstalled.  One thing i suggest is to disable vsync. Browse local files, go inside of the storage folder, in the file starbound.config, set it to false. It'll massively improve the FPS. There's definitly room for optimizations though (especially on windows).  Overall, i love this game. I've enjoyed playing it so far and I do hope the devs improve certain aspects of this game. Given that they have an unstable branch for testing the game, and the newest patch is alright so far. I'd if i were going off the negative reviews alone, they're slowly getting back on the right track.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"I liked this game back when it first came out on steam. When 1.0 came out, I figured I might enjoy it again. That wasn't the case. A lot of content was cut and even exploration feels much more bland and stale.   -Temperature system has been removed. This was one of the nice features back during the beta. Most clothing had function (Snow Infantry set was very useful) and it felt very relaxing sitting by a fire on a snow planet so you could warm up.  -Sectors have been removed. You used to only be limited in exploration by the temperature system and how warm or cool you could get. A forest planet in a sector would be just as dangerous as a lava planet on that same sector, and you would find the same resources on every planet in that sector until you moved on to the next one. This was a favorite feature of mine and really enhanced exploration because there was just as much incentive to going to the forest planet as the lava planet.   -Most techs are gone. I remember all the vehicle and flying techs, and how you'd have to find them to actually use them. Now that I can't use my bubble tech, I have to build giant pillars to get on avian pirate ships. And this isn't all, there was also a mech and some other vehicles. The only surviving tech vehicle is the boat, only now you have to waste pixels buying it instead of being incentivized to explore to find it.  -Randomly generated monsters and weapons have been removed. I enjoyed this because it added to exploration and had you wondering what kind of creatures and crazy weapons you'd find on a planet you'd land on. Every creature was unique and every weapon was unique, down to the name and function. This also added a lot of fun to exploration because of course, you wouldn't know what you're going to find.  -Story isn't that great. I honestly had more fun back when you'd build the bosses yourself in order to advance to the next sector and unlock more equipment and crafting tables. I thought the beginning of the story was fine, but the rest felt repetative and boring. 'Find a ________ settlement and scan objects' gets very annoying and I tend to just drift away from the story altogether. I have yet to face the final boss because of this.   -Plenty of weapons and armor have been cut, and I don't mean the randomized ones you used to find on planets. I mean weapons and armor you crafted at tables. Copper and gold almost seem to have no use anymore, and I quite enjoyed those armors, as bad as they were, and copper armor and weapons were easily obtained in the early game, allowing you to take on more dangerous things. It felt like I was legitimately getting stronger and every ore had a use. Almost any type of weapon could be made from any type of ore. Feel like making daggers? No problem. Spears? Yep. Instead now, there are too few craftable armors and weapons, and it seems ores have gotten even more scarce.  -Further cuts include certain dungeons (USCM bases are a prime example), and you can no longer attack NPCs unless you break all their stuff. If I want to be a murderous psychopath and purge xenos, just let me do it please. On top of all that, there's little reason to go to moons or asteroids anymore. Asteroids would be one of the most dangerous biomes in the game with the best resources, but now there's pretty much nothing.   I will repeat, I LOVED this game in 2013. Telling people to mod it in is no excuse and it's the wrong mentality to show to developers.    I'll change my opinion if some of the good features are added back into the game or some of the many promises Chucklefish made are implemented. Starbound simply feels like half the game it was when it first came out on Early Access.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Edit: Review Addendum for 1.0 release:  It's official, for their grand finale, Chucklefish has totally ruined Starbound.   They finally settled on one tedious game mechanic and a generic 'collect all the macguffins' plotline for the '1.0' release. Then they took all the hit or miss content they had tested and either vetted or removed over the last 3 years, carelessly ground it all up, and poured the resultant slop over the bland shitcake base game. Kinda like a chef who mulches an entire thanksgiving dinner into a soup, bones and all.  It seems like they couldn't decide how to properly implement all their old content in the face of the re-re-re-invented design, but rather than let it all go to waste, they just hastily rebranded and pasted bits of it everywhere. The slurry pulp that used to be sequential mission instances and technology unlocks is now an incomprehensible pile of broken gameplay chunks, haphazardly slapped everywhere without reason or direction.   The result is a horrible, disjointed, unplayable cluster♥♥♥♥ overflowing with inexplicable changes, even when it's NOT suffering from game-breaking slowdowns and fatal glitches. Unfortunately, this is the mess they've decided to settle on, so this is the mess we're stuck with. Even a dozen brilliant 3rd party user mods aimed at mitigating the damage aren't enough to salvage this disaster.   Good older content like the portable pixel printer are gone, while ridiculous, nonsensical additions were made, such as giant, unkillable ghosts that haunt every empty moon in the universe. Why??  In fact, that's the question that best sums up this entire 'official non-beta release.' WHY.  --Beta Version review follows:  I fear Starbound will turn out less like Disneyland, which is a functional masterpiece that will never be finished but constantly improved, and more like the Winchester House, constructed haphazardly and proceeding aimlessly without direction until its owner's death. The game has a more than decent framework, but the developers keep changing the game's premise, leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential.   It's gone from a Terraria-like 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses, to a story-driven series of instance dungeons, all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished (and/or unnecessary) features. This slash-and-burn development has left the game unfocused, long after the point where it should have been crystallizing. The initial hype has died down, releases are fewer and longer between, and content is stagnant for months at a time, leaving players wondering if there's any motivation or momentum left to see it completed.  The playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates, but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features, few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content. In their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game, they're offering a lot of gravy and not much meat.   Players will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment, leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests. Judging from the comments here and at other sites, many players have walked away due to the lack of content, and with them goes word-of-mouth support. After all, what good is an increasingly graphically refined game world if there's nothing new to do in it?",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"  I got 400+ hours out of a game I paid less than 15 dollars for, I've played it since Early Access, I have had my character wiped 4 times, If that is any indication on how long I've owned it. The game has a feel that not many other games have, the music is similar to the music of Morrowind, the weapons/combat remind me of Castlevania and the abilities are like the ones you get in Metroid or Mega Man. There is an endless galaxy to explore, a character to customize from various races, colonies to build, quests to complete, crops to grow, a ship to enhance and customize and monsters to capture. I think it is very worth the price. Oh, right. Hoverbikes.  Edit: I didn't receive the game for free, I have no idea why it says that or how to remove it.  Also, the modding community is extremely active and is on Steam Workshop/ Nexus Mods. I highly recommend Frackin' Universe and the XS Mech Mod. There are also mods that add in races and their communities/colonies which are really well done too.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Okay. We should be fair with Starbound. I will bs nobody. First off, I am a supporter from back when it was on Early Access. The game has been dramatically changed since then. I had to play through the whole game again, since my savegame was not compatible with V1 but who cares really?  So, what IS Starbound? Well it started as an open world sandbox game. KEEP THAT IN MIND PLEASE. So, since then a lot of stuff were added. We got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades, so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need. The game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions, to do some essential things. The whole tutorial is the lore of the game. Yup! A sandbox with lore as tutorial, how do you like that? One step before going against the final boss, you know you are ready to explore whatever you want. What a great idea! You also carry a codex, where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff, like journals, stories etc etc, very rewarding for readers. You can collect various stuff, like bugs, fish, fossils, and make collections out of them.  Randomly (?) generated quests occur all the time, with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff. Challenges are available and a lot of stuff to do.  You can farm, you can have your own pets... what else can I say about this awesome game?  Oh! The world! Well basically you start on a solar system. Then you go outside of it to another star. Stars are solar systems with planets inside them. Imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map. And believe me, there are LOTS of stars, full of planets to explore.  Favorite changes (for early access users that wanna see what's new): A] The pixel compressor has no penalty. B] The fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process. C] Optimized not to lag.   So let's see:  Graphics: 90% Fantastic pixel art  Sound: 90% Great music but too emotional for my taste. Still great. Gameplay: 90% It is very polished, the game seldom lags even on my old PC Replayability value: 90% With so many races, I bet this can be played many many times. Value for money: 90% I played 300 hours already, including the time before V1 was released. Scenario: 70% Interesting scenario, but that's it. &lt;&lt;&lt; This is considered an EXTRA on a sandbox game.  Do I recommend this? Well yes. It is a great game, just don't take it for an RPG. It is a sandbox.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"9/10  Starbound is a procedurally generated universe where you can plunder endless amounts of dungeons, build colonies, and mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It's a cute indie with co-operative multiplayer which makes up for its unassuming appearance with the sheer amount of content the developer provides, supports and continues to shell out.  Both the pixel art and soundtrack are both easy on your senses, creating an immersive atmosphere and inspiring ambience for late night galactic voyages.

211820,Starbound,"I'll be honest here, if you've never heard of starbound before, and you like the idea of a sci-fi sandbox survival-ish game, then you'll probably enjoy starbound. I however am giving this a thumbs down, for reasons I shall go into.  Long ago, in the early access days of starbound, players glimpsed what was a relatively complete game that was clearly a framework for something greater. Something complex. Hidden behind it's grid-based construction/mining engine was a surprisingly complex universe, complete with six unique races all of which had their own history, adversities, asthetic style and personality. For once it seemed like the character's species was actually going to matter, with even the descriptions of food items hinting that different species would have to eat different food, which is a very cool idea in a survival game. This type of complexity was, for me, what set starbound apart from other games in the genre, it wasn't just a sandbox, it was it's own world with conflicting cultures and people.  The earliest sign was that racial bonuses (abilities unique to what species your character was) was planned to be in the next update. These bonuses were later changed to be tied to the race's armoursets, where wearing the full set (head, torso, leggings) of a race's armour would confer it's bonus. This was apparently done for the sake of balance, and keeping each of the races equal. Sure, I thought, but to this day racial bonuses are still not part of the game.  Starbound's development has been slow. Very, very slow. I was ok with this, as it was the developer's first game, and after dabbling in game dev myself I am aware that it can be a very difficult thing to do. Things were fine at first, a slow creep of new assets and features, adding more content to the world's random-gen system, etc. Everything you'd expect from an early access title.  However, somewhere during development, something changed.  Everyone was hype for the next big update (as updates were incredibly rare) and it'd hit, sure there was all this cool new stuff they'd shown off in screenshots, but they would always come with a number of game-breaking bugs that would severely impact gameplay, and would sometimes take months to be fixed. But the most bizarre part to me was that CF would often just cut assets entirely from the game. Items, furniture, gone. no explanation given. Just gone, and for a game about exploration, collection and building, this seemed like a very odd move.  The last few updates leading up to 1.0 were the worst offenders at this. The previous diversity and characterisation of the game's six races were severely stripped away, racial weapons, and ship AI were removed for seemingly no reason, which is very strange considering the racial AI often featured in the game's devblog. This, along with the removal/altercation of several other features (the game's UI being one of them) pushed things over the line for me. I had hope, I had patience, but I look upon the finished product that is the 1.0 build currently on sale here and can't help but feel utterly disappointed.  In summary, what first appeared to be a surprisingly complex twist on the survival sandbox genre was dumbed down to rush it for release. Also, the game costs $5 less now. It's nice I paid extra to experience this disappointment.  There are actually a number of other issues I could go into as to why I'm giving this a thumbs down, from reckless spending to the developer's reaction to criticism, but this review is already long enough.  =================================================================  EDIT: Since everyone seems to comment on this. Yes, I have 1600+ hours played. This is because the early access builds had a launcher that was very easy to leave open for long periods of time, also I did actually enjoy playing the game, however, now that 1.0 has been released, many of the things I enjoyed about it have been removed, and I am doubtful they will ever be restored, hence my negative review.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I dig this game way way more than Terraria. There's just way more roleplaying potential to a game where you explore the endless Universe, as opposed to a game where you go right or left. I just want to manspread my Galactic Empire.  But fine i'll specify the finer points that tip the scales for me: - Artstyle is less chibi and more 'visible'. I know that sounds like not much of a differrence in a pixel game, but it's going to have a much bigger merit after hours of gameplay. - Size scaling. Everything in Starbound is visible and more up close, whereas Terraria seems 'tiny' with a lot of 'wasted' space. I don't know if Terra scales with monitors, but either way. - The flashlight. Sounds silly, but it makes exploring caves in Starbound much more fun. You no longer have to spend most of earlygame on putting torches around. - Varied races, but that's a given. - Varied worlds, but that's a given. - The main building tool in Starbound is much more convenient and versatile. But that might be a negative point for people who prefer heavier roleplaying. - Workshop - Weapons and animations are much better in my opinion. There is absolutely no stiffness to attacks. - Building is much better as well, you can freely choose between using the same material for either the foreground or the background. Not only more realistic, but more convenient as well. - The Starship HUB.  Look at that. Points.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"It is a very sad day indeed when the people that play a game know more about what makes it fun than the people that made it. I have played Starbound from the very beginning, before it was an early access game on Steam. It was awesome! The things they had planned for this game, the things they had already available for this game was very exiting indeed. Every time you went to a planet, you got a different palette of trees, rocks, soil, water, monsters and food! They had the promise of different abilities for each race. At the very beginning they had a system where you had to build a fire to keep warm until you could muster enough resources to make yourself warm clothes!!! Then the combat update came! The game they where designing then was very promising indeed.  Sadly most of this stuff has been taken out. Along the way they lost the vision of the game they had and 1.0 is what we got. A very boring and empty game. What the devs fail to understand is that the community was playing the last stable update, and loving it, look at the ratings! All I wanted was a sort of story and lore to be created for the universe I was playing in and that would of been awesome! But instead I got 1.0, a shallow, stripped down version of a game that I was promised. To top it off, it’s full of awful bugs and optimization problems! It’s funny when you think about it, the beta was more stable and more optimized. I wish I could uninstall 1.0 and go back to the last stable version, I had more toys to play with in that version. My sensei once told me that to be successful you need a posture in life. When you do something, you have to believe in what your doing and stand by it, even when the waters come rushing against it and try to bring it down. They should of kept their initial vision, the game would have been a lot better. I can’t recommend this title in it’s current state. I’m happy that you sold over 60 000 copies since 1.0’s release guys, but once the community has a taste of what they bought, I don’t think your gonna sell much more, just look at the new reviews coming in.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"A lot of people have been saying this game is like Terraria. Now, I'd like to clear up the misunderstanding here.  Yes, maybe with some features, gameplay, pixel style and 2-D side scroller, it is like terria. But other than that, it doesn't FEEL like Terraria at all. In fact, it's better.  Terarria fails to capture the subtle beauty of Starbound, with it's amazing sounndtract and the wonderlust that we all have for space. It's simplistic at first glance, but dives much deeper than you'd think.  It has a story ark for those who like set missions and goals, and a certain path they have to follow. Explorations dominates the game, and the world of Starbound is ridden with lore. Each race is whimsical in nature, from robots being the ones the least technilogically advanced, and flower-people being the most carnivorous and ficious species alive. For those who like to let creativity soar, you can build whatvever your heart desires. From tall futuristic buildings scraping the sky, to a small wooden cavern laying behind a line of trees.  And the best of all, if you'd just like to relax, you can always just grab your handy dandy manupilator module and chop some logs, or go mining and listen to the tic-tic-tic of ores ppopping out of foreground and background alike. Chill with some friends around a campfire jamming out to 12 days of christmas on your various instruments, or team up to find legendary (and curiously awesome and even more awesomely named) weopons, and battle tiny penguins who got their flippers on asault rifles and tanks.  I don't think Starbound strives to be a spesific game. It doesn't strive to have an ending either. Not being able to call it quite a sandbox, I'll call it an adventure you have to play, and experiance for yourself. I can never tire of this game, and doubt I ever will. Billions of unique planets, creatures, species and collectables hover at your fingertips. All you have to do is try not to think about scary purple ghosts as you get the fuel to power your spaceship, and explores stars across the galaxy ;)  Starbound is such an unique game, putting it into words is both a challenge, and an impossible feat I have attempted and failed. Just know that it is worth every penny and far more, and that it is, and always will be, one of my very favourite games.  ~Toodles, 2D-Bunnie",1,1

I have spent hours and hours amassing materials and creating multi-tier gardens with glowing glass walls, so I could plant and harvest day and night. I've fought cultists and abominations, post-apocalyptic survivalists and primatives, and every other thing inbetween. I've committed village massacres and protected stoic swamp-dwelling frogmen.

211820,Starbound,"100% Recommend this game. You'll see as of the official 1.0 release, the majority of reviews are negative. I respectfully disagree with them. Did the devs make some shortsighted decisions while pushing the official release? They sure did. Are there things that used to be in the game that have been removed? Well yeah, you bet. Are there new mechanics that seem tedious and hold back the player, simple for the sake of holding back the player? Pretty much.  But guess what? This game is still. Not. Finished.  The 1.0 release isn't 'The End' of Starbound, these devs have been with us since day one, the game has always been fun and has always been changing. Sometimes things get nerfed into oblivion, sometimes things are game-breakingly strong. It's a delicate task to balance something with so much content! AND THEY AREN'T DONE!   I have faith that this game will only continue to improve, at WORST this is a rough patch and in no way do the devs deserve the amount of flak they have received these past few days. If you're a little worried about purchasing this game right now, then hold off until it's on sale or until the majority of recent reviews are positive - it's your call. But don't let all the nay-sayers scare you away, this game is phenomenal and provides many MANY hours of fun.   I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this review but this is just the way I see it. I love Starbound through thick and thin, and I am deeply saddened that so many people turn their backs on it after being loyal for so long.

211820,Starbound,"It's hard to say which one is better as Terraria and Starbound both play out very different from one another. Guess it comes down to your personal preference and what you expect from them.  Personally I favor Starbound over Terraria. To me Terraria is all about fighting hoards of monsters and bosses while farming rare drops almost mmorpg style. There's little to no story at all and the world itself is very boring. And for a game that mostly takes place underground, mining and exploration is very tedious and unrewarding.   This is where the major differences lie with Starbound. It offers a huge galaxy populated with different races and animals with a good amount of lore behind them. There's everything from underwater metropolises to small farming villages, ruins of forgotten civilizations, creepy dungeons and hightec research labs. All this combined with a short story and some beautifully hand crafted missions make Starbound a really interesting world to explore.  Starbound also allows for very different playstyles and almost everything is optional in order to progress. You can build villages or huge farms, explore for resources or mine them, become self sufficient or survive by trade, do quests and gather a crew or roll as a lone wolf.. Or maybe you just wanna kill, pillage and plunder everything in your path. All valid options in order to survive.  That said, combat is not as streamlined as in Terraria and is more a part of a whole, rather than the main focus. Building, farming crops, questing and exploring is as much a part of Starbound as combat is. So if your looking for a similar hack'n'slash combat focused experience, then you'll be disappointed and proberly find the game lacking.  Now don't get me wrong, combat in Starbound ain't bad. It's just different. And wide variety of awesome and crazy weapons helps to make it interesting. There's swords, spears, hammers, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, 'nade launches, flamethrowes, rocket launchers, weird alien tec etc etc.. You can even dual wield a large variety of weapons in any way you see fit. Only thing I personally don't like is a specific class of some voodoo sci-fi psi-ops elementalist magic bull that doesn't really seem to fit into the game. But I digress..  Starbound is a game suited for people that like to build, explore and create their own little adventures. If you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer, then you'll get a plesant and enjoyable experience.  Closing argument and metaphor.. If Terraria is like a lego technic set, where you have to follow a specific schematic in order to achieve your goal. Then Starbound is a huge box of random lego blocks that requires you to use your imagination to reach it instead.",1,1

But if you're really new to Starbound, why should you care? You weren't there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow, when the koalas were furious, and when everything was all cream and gravy.  I'm not going to lie, I'm an old person too. I miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you.  I miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades.  I miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items.  I miss my bubble tech and my old characters.  I miss when the toolbar only had one L and one R.  But that's for the old people to mope about. Sure, I miss it, but that time has passed long ago. New things await ahead, and I can't complain about that. It'll never be Old Starbound, but it'll always be Starbound to me.  I think if you started here, you'd find something you would enjoy. You wouldn't be dragged down by the good ol' days.

Why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself?  Go out there and explore Starbound. You might find something you could never imagine.    There's also a race of Harambes. You can explore galaxies without pants. You can slaughter innocent people of towns you find. You can kill your friends. You can play pokemon and enslave small creatures. You can be a weeaboo fish man. You can get anime blades. You can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to 'ice' people. (BAHAHAHAHAHA) You can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you don't need.       YOU CAN EVEN BE A PRO GENJI LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF WITH MODS TOO HOLY ♥♥♥♥ JUST GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  ",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Ironicly enough, The Developers play in trashcans.  EDIT:  Since My time playing it from 3 or so years ago it hasn't changed much, A half baked story, Same-y and bland planets, and boring quests, its all the same. The developers are incompetent and couldn't program a toaster without throwing out all the code 3 times.  Notice how the changelog looks very impressive, but if you take a second and look at it no real gameplay has been added. Terraria is a much more compelling and rich experience and that game didn't need a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars. A possible Alternative to starbound is to slam your head against a wall while playing terraria, The best part about that is when (If) your concussion heals you will have an actually good game to play.  An Entire Universe to explore, and yet every single planet feels the same. Water, Water, Everywhere, And yet not a drop to drink.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Developers fail to complete the basic tasks of beta process, let alone putting out a good game. Save your money, or spend it on Terrarria. Now that starbound is 1.0 I gladly say what garbage this game is. Save your money for Otherworld. And the 250 hours was helping beta, sad my long suffering did not pay off.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I bought this game when it was originally released on Steam. I gave it some time, and understood that being Early Access it would feel incomplete. I'm no programmer, never done anything of this sort, but after 11 months I was expecting a lot more content and polish. I might recommend this game eventually, but based on the progress they've been making that may not be until next decade.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"This game is essentially a really cool lego set with a rather poor story and some cool dungeons which you need to grind boring crap for hours to actually do.   Many of the items that actually made it into the game are useless... Hoverbikes are practical, but awful.  Boats.... why would you ever want one? There don't appear to be any oceans to traverse other than the ones on ocean planets. And on those everything worthwhile is underwater. By the time you can afford either you'll probably be sick of the game. Farming is too tedious and nothing can be automated. There's a cool wiring system, but not a lot useful you can actually do with it.  Colonies are simply player made sources of the same crappy fetch and escort quests that non-player villages can do. Colonists won't farm for you. Your crew are more of a pain than a help and will constantly block crafting stations.   This looks like an excellent game engine upon which a great game could be made using mods; but by itself it really isn't a great game. It's certainly not what we were sold in the kickstarter nor does it live up to the promise of what was in beta.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I have to say, I'm amazed with Starbound.  I bought it some years ago just out of duty because I started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere. Let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time Chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game, which are two major points that would drive me towards a game, but I'm a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like. The art was great, but the game heavily lacked direction, feeling a lot like a sci-fi terraria, hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet, built a nice house, and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons. I was not impressed.  Recently I decided to give it a try if anything because I owned the game and hadn't taken a look at it since two years ago. And honestly, the game is great now. Not only there's a story, but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character, tech to unlock, and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward.  The art is gorgeous, and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokémon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun. The survival elements are back and although I can see why they took them out of the game, feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving (there's food everywhere and you'll have no problem staying fed), the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole you'll see.  The objectives are distinct, and the exploration is tense since you'll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items. A lot of the equipment you'll find is more aesthetic than anything, and weapons are kinda meh, but it's super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works. Action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars, making the overall hotkey capacity alright. The techs are fun and meaningful, getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration, and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time.  The only problems I really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me, like for instance when jumping down a platform you'll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the 'down' button, making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself, or that double tapping in a direction can trigger Dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise. Sometimes you'll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios, but taking it slowly will help with that so it's not too bad.  Overall though, I think it's a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its SEA phase. The sense of progression is tangible, the settlements are fun, the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes. From an aimless Terraria in space to a proper metroidvania, Starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library.  9/10.",1,1
211820,Starbound,Played for 5 minutes Already more content than No Man Sky,1,1
211820,Starbound,"The release of 1.0 has been met with both negative and positive responses; largely negative, as early-access players feel that the game lacks some of the content that previous builds promised. And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment. Prior to 1.0, Chucklefish presented us with mechanics like racially exclusive weaponry, temperature variants and even space stations. There was a lot of great content that has since been removed.  However, the game still has the potential to change, something that a lot of people fail to recognise.   PROS: - Visually speaking, this is one of the nicest looking pixel platformers I've ever seen.  - The crafting system is rich and complex, but does take getting used to. You now have the ability to upgrade your crafting stations instead of building newer models. The scan function on your M.M now means you can craft any item you've scanned prior, which is handy.  - Each species gets its own unique ship, armour sets, dialogue and lore (with the exception of the Novakid. Seriously. Where are my Novakid towns, Chucklefish?) - There is a lot to explore, both above and below ground. No two planets are alike.  - If you have the incentive, building houses and buildings is a fun and rewarding experience. You can even summon settlers to occupy your builds for you.  CONS: - The new HUD and item bar are difficult to use and look ugly. The old one worked fine, and wasn’t in need of a makeover.  - Combat swings between being enjoyable and insufferable. The ‘damage on contact’ system is stupid, especially when coupled with the number of monsters that spawn; I’ve had ten of the things on screen, and died because of lag because I was crushed in the middle. - Five years and there’s still no ‘store all’ option for item containers.  - The story is weak, flimsy and repetitive.   As a sandbox survival game, Starbound is brilliant. There is a lot to see, millions of planets to explore and a great deal of depth to building and creating, as well as the reintroduced hunger mechanic.  As an action game, however, Starbound falls short. Combat is weak and laggy (the game has trouble running when there’s a lot on screen) and the story falls flat.   Personally, I love this game; I love it because building and creating and exploring is something I enjoy. I’m quite happy to spend an hour or two gathering materials to customise my ship or house with. However, this isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a more balanced experience regarding combat and plot, then there are other games which are much better suited!",1,1
211820,Starbound,"So I see a lot of bad reviews since the new 1.0 patch. I get people are upset that things got wiped and things have changed. People must also remember that these games go through massive changes to make the game more polished and run/ work better. With that being said here is my review as a new player so far.   I love everything this game has offered since the splash screen. My friend and I have completely lost all sense of time and direction while playing this(both of us came from terraria). Amazing soundtrack, gameplay, art style(yes I know it's old school but it's still pretty), crafting system(huge and tons of variation), weapons, clothing/armor. I could go on about all the great things we have seen in just the few hours we have played. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Terraria. I fought a penguin flying an UFO. Soooo yea play it and I promise you won't be let down if you are new to the title. A lot of the older players from early access(or w/e it's called) don't like some of the changes but coming in new you won't know those changes and it won't matter purely because the game is fresh to you. Do yourself a favor and try it.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"As someone with a substantial amount of playtime and experience in this, it's morbidly entertaining to watch this get/have gotten progressively worse with each update.      EDIT: Starbound 1.0 is out! Come back and do all the fetch quests all over again! This time there's removed content and still a large disparity in balance. There have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3D printer now, but they're immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to (nearly) max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3D printed furniture.  All variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now. The arid, deserted, ded landscape that was Starbound's 'endgame' is now slightly more decorated, but to compensate, all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be! Hooray!  Oh and don't consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working, the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what I mean.",-1,1

It starts great, but that ending, shorter than Rage.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Game is finally out... but it seems to be rushed and incomplete.  version 1.0 is extremely poorly optimized. Game drops to 15 fps and fluctuates wildly depending on your environment. An RX480 is just as good as a laptop GPU.  Crafting wise, it seems to have a lot of ornamental things, but actual useful items... not that many. In some 12-15 hours you can upgrade everything you need, leaving you only to follow the main quest.  NPC sidequests are rather stupid, take note/resources to some other NPC nearby (if you're lucky) or go to some area in the world and get some NPC back to town. Not sure why they thought ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO type quests will be fun.  Given how long it took for the developers to actually release the game, justifying it as 'we don't want to rush it, we want the game to be great, we don't want to offer a half baked experience', I can't help but think that chuckle when the game starts is a sort of ' you idiots paid us 3 years ago for this game, bet you feel smart now'.  Very disappointed by what the game delivered vs what it promised (to be honest, I might have gone past the content if the game wasn't performing so awful).",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"First, I recommend checking out Tystarchius' review here, since my thoughts are basically a continuation and elaboration:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/tystarchius/recommended/211820   Like him, I wish there was a third 'neutral' option: I can't recommend the game in its current state, but that doesn't make it necessarily a *bad* game. I want to be able to come back to this review in a year and just replace the whole thing with 'edit: nvm'. As it stands, however, there are simply too many flawed design decisions and silly/stupid mechanical mistakes to enjoy it.  There are numerous small missteps, so I'm going to just go for the big ones here:   * The gameplay loop is broken.  Quick definition: Gameplay loops describe the core set of repetitive actions that make a game fun, and are composed of multiple disparate elements. For example, in Doom, you're not JUST shooting monsters; you're also searching for secrets, which lead to treasure, which enhances your ability to shoot more monsters. Stardew Valley has a half-dozen systems that interweave - farming, fighting, socializing - that all positively influence and enhance one another; any given activity provides benefits to other activities, meaning time is never wasted and you're always making progress.  In Starbound, this loop is broken, as all of the various systems are disconnected. You can complete the game without ever creating a single settlement, planting a single seed, or taking a single randomly-generated mission to gain a crew member. For some reason, Chucklefish thought this was a *selling point* instead of a massive design failure. Being able to skip entire elements, systems and game mechanics is not good game design! Not only that, but these extra systems are completely superfluous, as they are *less efficient* than the core element of planet exploration. You can just run around collecting the resources, which is usually a much faster method than farming or questing.  The point of a gameplay loop is to give the players a break and let them focus on other activities before returning to the main progression. This keeps the game fresh longer and prevents burnout/fatigue, which is incredibly important in long-running games like this. Terraria's gameplay loop balanced this well: exploring (fighting, looting, digging) would lead naturally to the other elements, like farming (critically important buffs from potions) and building (new NPCs at a steady rate need housing), without forcing you to dump more time than strictly necessary if you didn't want to get fancy.  * The survival mechanics aren't fun.  First, hunger. This mechanic has never been fun for me, and its implementation in Starbound is no different. 'Use a consumable item every X minutes/hours' is just an annoyance. Fortunately, food is generally abundant (defeating the whole purpose of the mechanic...), but more importantly, more complex and rare foods give you a ton of bonuses, which is pretty fun.  However, the Environmental Protection Pack as a gate to planetary exploration is incredibly lazy. It's just an armor slot that unlocks a few more biomes at a time, which are all coincidentally around specific stars. There's nothing interesting about it, just 'oh, I can go to a jungle planet now, which was apparently radioactive before'. This is likely to make each new biome feel exciting and fresh, but instead it just makes them feel uninteresting. This is exacerbated by the fact most mini-biome and 'dungeons' (including villages) can appear in *any* biome, leading to Floran villages perched between volcanoes, Avian villages set in frozen wastelands, and beautiful flower gardens springing up on eternally dark horror-planets.  Speaking of randomization:  * The procedural generation is lackluster.  This is a doozy. I will grant that the planet terrain generation has improved *significantly* over the years since the first playable alpha, but it's still not as robust or interesting as Terraria's. Granted, Terraria has a few years' head start on Starbound, but it still needs a lot more work to be competitive.  My main gripe is that all of the 'dungeon' spawns are literally identical, down to creature spawns, aesthetic decorations, and even treasure loot tables. (I once found two underground abandoned Glitch dungeons with an EPP mod in the exact same 'random' corner box.) This means that if you've seen one Hylotl town or Apex resistance base, you've literally seen all of them. There's no mystery or excitement; it's just 'oh, these guys again'. This is pretty much inexcusable, given the game prides itself on randomization and the nature of these changes are trivial. The game generates entire planets! Why are all the dungeons wholly static?! If you need some suggestions, Spelunky released an interactive tutorial that explains how their rooms are put together! Why is this a problem for Starbound?!  * Progression and solar systems are goofy.  As mentioned above, the EPP is a silly, lazy content gate to different solar systems. I should be able to see icy planets toward the outer edge of a system while those toward the center are hot, and find a mixture of biomes and challenges across them for me to discover if I can or can't handle on my own. Just a handwavey 'yeah you're good bro' to the next color of star is boring.  This also means the planets all feel samey, with some different art assets but the same gameplay. There's no difference between mining on a volcanic planet or a frozen planet, other than getting down from the surface initially. The progression of armor tiers is just basic stat increases, with a very uninspired range/damage/defense decision in endgame. It's the same process to collect ores from every planet with no differences in threat or difficulty once you've reached the appropriate gear tier. It's almost a microcosm of the game itself: dig past the shallow surface and underneath it's the same, over and over again, until you win or get bored.  This is where the survival elements could tie in with the colony system, had you any reason to build one. Except colonists don't care if they're on a lava planet or tropical paradise; their quests don't change, they don't ask for structural protections from the elements or anything, they just stand around like every other NPC villager and do little cute things until they're either attacked or have a quest for you. No 'build a weather machine' or 'help us set up a farm, but the soil sucks because it's a toxic planet', just 'Billy got lost' or 'there's a bunch of cultists out by that random lawn chair, can you go investigate?'   This review has rambled on long enough, so I'm going to end it here. I critique because I care; I *want* Starbound to succeed and get better, and the only way to do that is to complain - at length - about the numerous problems in hopes someone notices and starts to fix it. Mods will help in the future, but right now there aren't any to address the deep and jarring issues with the base systems themselves. Maybe in a year, it'll be finally finished, but right now...  tl;dr pls make game better tia",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I've waited 4 years for this game to come out.  I was really devastated to find out they succumbed and released it out into the Early-Access, because it was around the time when Early-Access was getting a lot of love, and only so much hate. This was before stuff like Towns development stopped and stuff, people didn't yet see the trouble in it all.  Well, it came out there, and I played it, along with others. I walked around, I killed things, I did the lame penguin boss fights. I was unimpressed - Rightly so I would think, it's not fully developed yet, it's not released, I couldn't judge it well in it's state. I noticed things were getting added by community requests, and this is where I started to shy away from it, I didn't want to see what was gonna be one of my dream games, altered and messed around with by the community - for good or worse.  So I ignore the dev blog from there on out, and waited my extra, I guess two years.  Lo and behold, right there on Steam, it's out. Let's give this a proper go.  (ignore 30 hours of gameplay, that was with the betas, my actual playtime is no more than 17 hours, also, Steam didn't have enough space for my full review, I trimmed where I could)  The intro to the game is very slow and sluggish, it gives you the basic tools you need to get started, and you start mining away at the surface for goodies and oddities, pretty classic compared to another game of this genre.  I amassed my metals and my tools, made myself new weapons and armors, and got to more killing. Then your first real quest is to go really deep into the planet, get a certain type of material, and teleport to the 'hub' of the game. Well god damn if that didn't take me forever, it didn't feel that exciting.  After you find out about the hub, you find out you have to mine moons for fuel to jump to new planets out of your reach. Might sound cool at first, but it gets annoying very fast.  You tend to hop planet to planet mining the next tier of resources, and making stuff, but within this whole mess, you have to go around to certain planets, and find each of the six races and their civilizations, and go into SCAN mode, and start clicking around for green highlighted objects, and talk to people, to learn more about them, and eventually get the next Mission to go on.  The Missions are like adventure instances, a pre-made map with an objective and puzzles with monsters all over the place. They're fun, but after you do a few of em, you just want it to stop. They lose their interest quickly, when the bosses later turn into bullet sponges, few of them are unique with cool fights.  The main storyline itself just felt, too forced. I thought this was sort of a primarily exploration and sandbox based game. Well, multiple aspects and shops etc. are blocked from you, until you progress enough in the storyline, so it feels forced and boring right off the bat. Normally to me, this would have been fine, but this felt unnecessary and everything else just gets flat because of it.  (It gets really annoying trying to find the proper planets to just scan some more and more)  Onto the gameplay aspects and mechanics, progression in the game is done by crafting. You craft the first tier of armor and weapons, and then you tend to go find new, randomly generated weapons to kick ♥♥♥ with, and crafting new toolbenches and armor to go along with the new materials.  It's a little sad, being that making your own weapons is a waste of time, because all the strong - and unique - ones are all out there in the universe, not on your crafting screen. There's only a few tiers of actual equipment as well, it's very short lived. By 8 hours into the game I had already acquired what seemed to be the best armor out of the materials you find in the game.  Onto the UI of the game, it's just, annoying. I don't feel like it's presented very well, it could have been much cleaner. Opening your inventory always gave me a headache, as it opens right in the damn middle of your screen, blocking your character and things around them. You can move it around thankfully, but it doesn't maintain that position the next time you open it, so it's just a constant struggle trying to open it up in the field. There's a sort function for it thankfully, but not for chests, which gets very annoying, because there's simply so much ♥♥♥♥ you pick up in the game, that you need to constantly reorganize it all if you're picking it all up. With chests not being able to be sorted, it just causes you a whole hour of frustration, trying to reorganize it all.  The difficulty of the game is modest. When you make your character, you have the choice of Casual, Survival or Hardcore. Casual has no real penalties for dying, you only drop a small percentage of pixels, and you can just walk on back and get right back to it. Survival seems to be the 'normal' difficulty, you need to eat to survive, you drop certain items on death, and you drop more pixels. Hardcore is Survival, included that, when you die once, you're dead forever.  In the end, I honestly just felt stupid for playing Survival, my other friends just chose casual because, having to keep up with food all the time just sounded like an annoying chore. It really was. I would constantly just be chowing down whatever I found to keep my meter happy, and the drop items on death penalty just made it all the while more boring.  There's a lot of other little attractions here and there, you can own a farm, and make shipments (homage to Harvest Moon I would assume), there's a Pokemonlike capturing system for pets. Upgrades to your ship along with crew. Vehicles to ride around in (though, no promised mech sadly), little challenge rooms out in the world. They're neat, though ultimately, I never gave em a chance. I got my hotrod and rode around and that was that.  Sadly, there's a lot of bugs in the game, more than I was betting on. Food sometimes became infinite, planets generated too slowly for me to traverse, and I've had the game crash on me and freeze several times when I'm just moving about. The FPS however, takes the cake. It would CONSTANTLY keep dropping and screwing up, I looked around and tried the fixes people suggested, and to no avail, and I typically don't have technical issues with games on my end, so this was a huge concern of mine.  Dropping to 30 frames when just walking around, really sucks.  Graphicly/Aesthetically, it's awesome, and the soundtrack is amazing along with it. Good listening in and out of game.  All in all, at the end of the day, the game feels like it's just a bit of a repetitve cycle with no clear reward at the end. Hop from planet to planet, hoping to find something cool next time, and get annoyed that you have to keep mining fuel to continue on. I beat the game, and it just didn't feel satisfying in the least.  I've felt like I haven't covered enough about the game, but at the same time, I can feel (and see) that I've written too much already.  I don't feel like this game is a worthy spirtual successor to Terraria, as some would like to claim. I had that notion back when it was in development, but no more. I just see this as another blotch on my game list that I want removed. If you read through and at one point just said 'but there's a mod for X' or 'wait for an update'. Then no, and no.  The player shouldn't have to resort to mods to fix an issue, and I've done plenty of waiting, I thought one of the points of the beta was so they COULD fix things, and polish it all up. Sadly, it still feels quite raw and buggy, and just not worth my investment. I don't  want to wait around longer for things to get better - That was suppose to be now.  I dunno if the wait was really worth it is what I'm getting at.   tl;dr This is a one way trip out into space. Wether you want to stay up there, or land somewhere else, well, you might get displeased either way.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"Played this game all the way from its inception and I have to say I am dissapointed with the final product in relation to the time they spent on it.  The problems are not with what the game is, it is a good game. It is what it could have been and to me the final execution feels rushed. So many reworks, I think they tried to achieve perfection and got tired with it and in the end released a ill thought out rushed game. Ok here are my main problems.  The questline and story they added is terrible  The main questline features a few basic starter tutorial like missions to get you into the game and then basically has you repeat the exact same quest 6 times before facing a final boss. It is always worrying when the tutorial missions are more interesting and fun to play then any other part of the game. It is also so crazy short. I completed the game in 2 days with little effort which links in to my second issue.  It is very easy  This is basically down to progression not being linked to the questline. Once your out of the starter missions and you have repaired your ship, you can basically get a a top tier weapon and armor before actually doing any of the main questline. Progression in starbound is not bound to the questline or story. I think this was a design flaw. Sure you can just pace it yourself, but the even bigger issue is this my next point.  You can basically mine everything you need to progress to the next tech tier in one mining run  So for example, when I unlocked tech to let me visit the fiery or frozen stars, basically the stars that had everything but the final ore, I was able to mine enough of every single resource needed to completely max my tech out in one trip. I was able to get enough materials to get all three of the end game armor sets and crafting stations. From one run. Then when you unlock the final planet ore, again one run gives you all the solarium you need to finally max out your armor and anything else you need. Thats it game is pretty much done. You should have a god like weapon by now as they can literally spawn in the most basic of chests anywhere in the game. So if you havent already beaten all the bosses, go and jump about spamming fire and complete them. Thats pretty much it which leads me to my next issue.  I dont see any reason to play on once completed  You may differ with me in opinion here, but I really couldnt see any point in going back to play any more. I mean the fun is in looting and exploring right? So once you have unlocked the hardest difficulty planet there is no point in going to any others as the reward is worthless to you at this point. The side missions and 'town/villages' they implemented with npc missions are utterly pointless. Very low reward for doing repitive tedious missions. So basically 90% of the games worlds are no longer worth visiting at this point. You already have godlike everything which you found in the first chest you encountered on one of these planets. What is the point? I really hope I am missing something here but this was my experience of it. Sure you can max your ship out, sure you can try to build a colony, it all just feels shallow and completely pointless. Like features people wanted which they just added without any thought in relating it to the rest of the gameplay.  I played terraria for weeks and actually found bits of it tough, I dont think I ever saw everything and the final boss was difficult for me and took me quite a few attempts.  I honestly finished starbounds final release in two days and never really had any problems dying.  What could they have done?  Make looting make sense. So rubbish loot on the surface, better loot for quest rewards, more rare items the deeper you go etc.   Make an end game where early game planets are still relevant.  Make other game features like ship and colony building relevant and necessary for the main game questline.  Actually have a decent questline with variation in missions and a lot, lot, lot more of them.  Increase overall difficulty of pretty much everything.  The final 4 tiers of ore are basically split on 2 tiers, 3 of them having equal weighting on a lower tier and then one final ore which lets you upgrade each of these 3 tiers to a final tier (we are talking armor and weaponry here). This was a clear of sign of rushing to me. These should have been four seperate upgrades instead of two.   And so much more I could write all night but I am not going to.  I have to ask myself, what did they spend well over a year on? I played ti with my friend before and we actually spent a good week on it and I remember having a lot of fun. There were not any quests and maybe one or two bosses I cannot remember, but the progression made more sense and the game was tougher. I remember actually struggling against mobs at points, we actually had to do the old build a wall around us with a peep hole to shoot out of trick to actually get through some of the tougher areas. Loot made sense as well, like it was actually worth exploring and looting stuff.   What happened guys? I thought this was gonna be the game that kept me amused for months when it was completed.  I could have beat ruin with my eyes closed.  TL:DR In summary this is a fun game and an enjoyable experience, its just too easy, too short with a lot of worthless features adding nothing to gameplay and most damaging for it it has no replay value at all once you have beaten all the bosses as the game design makes 90% of the game worthless after this point.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Since this game attracts the Terraria crowd, here's a review about what you should expect out of this game compared to Terraria. For starters, Starbound is kind of like Terraria on steroids - it's bigger, far more involved (it actually has a quest component to it) and it's way harder.  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Gameplay Differences   Even on the easiest setting, Starbound plays like Terraria Hardmode from the very beginning. There's a difference between 'hard' and 'obnoxious', though, and in my opinion, this game is in the 'hard' category. You'll have to get on your feet and learn how things work, but thankfully, this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time. You really appreciate every item you find, because you're going to be very weak for a long time in the beginning, and your first desire will be to get rid of that crappy starter weapon.   If you've already played Terraria, you'll know how to jump right in to Starbound. The game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining, taking items, building houses and fighting enemies. It's bascially 'another take on Terraria,' as you'll see very quickly. Terraria's controls are simply better - jumping and curving in mid-air to reach a narrow platform is frustrating in this game, and you'll have to get used to how its 'gravity' works, as it is far more unforgiving. Couple that with the fact that you'll get seriously hurt (or killed) from falling.  Starbound has a bigger emphasis on food than Terraria. Food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in Terraria (except for pumpkin pies), but it is a necessity here -- especially on the harder tier, where you'll starve to death...this doesn't happen in the easiest mode, though. You'll start off finding and knowing about basic food, but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items. Food not only increases health, but gives perks and stat boosts as well. Even on the easiest setting, food rots if you hold on to it for too long.   +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Combat  Combat is highly simplistic in Starbound, it is nothing more than hack &amp; slash for the most part. Some monsters attack by nature, some don't, but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked, making combat predictable in this game.   Unlike Terraria, you'll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly and not far after getting started, rather than in Terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain NPCs. For the most part - one handed swords swing quicky and allow you to use a shield in the other hand, but they are weak and will require many 'hits' to kill an enemy. Two-handed swords are slow, but do far more damange than a one-handed. Other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse, and release to swing. Guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down, but will allow you to do it from a safe distance. In the beginning, you'll want to stay far, far away from any enemy that has a gun - especially if it's a sniper rifle.  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Look &amp; Feel  Starbound has the look and feel of an early 90s PC or SNES game, kind of like something made by Ocean or Sierra, as opposed to Terraria's more pixellated NES feel. Starbound's music is more predictable and uniform - lots of quiet, soothing piano music.   Starbound's 'monsters' look like Pokemon rejects, which kind of gave the game its own characteristic. I personally like the huge range, style and diversity of Terraria's creatures way more. Landscapes are far more detailed then Terraria, especially backdrops, trees and other elements. Trees fall sideways when cut, and you'll be surprised when you see your first landslide when you're mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime. This game has the same 'biome' style regions as Terraria, where you'll venture from a forest to a jungle, or from a cavern to a slime pit, and eventually down to magma. From experience, it looks like digging too far down will result in an long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava - be careful when you're digging a Starbound 'hellevator' as you won't get the same results as you did in Terraria...  Terraria's building mechanic is more involved and intricate than Starbound for the simple reason of hammers: they allowed you to hit blocks into 'angles' and make tons of different and unique designs, corners and slopes in Terraria. No such thing exists in Starbound, where you can only place items in square blocks. However, Starbound's graphics are more detailed and beautiful, and you'll still be able to create great looking structures. There's no 'corruption' or 'crimson' style event that you'll have to worry about in Starbound, so, create what you want and don't worry about what will happen to it mid-way through the game.  For the most part, you take take or steal almost everything you see in Starbound, just like you can in Terraria, except on missions (for example, your first real mission, The Outpost, where all of the chairs/beds/consoles/etc are locked down and immobile). For items that you can't craft, you may come across blueprints which are one-use items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables, one you have the necessary tool to do so.  When it comes to crafting, everything works pretty much the same between the two games. Craft a workbench-style item and it will allow you to create new items. In Starbound, you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items. You'll find that in order to do this, better ore from outside your solar system is necessary.  Negatives: you can't pause the game (WHY?!)  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: My Favorite Things  There are a few things that set Starbound from Terraria in my mind - the game's universe seems bigger and more 'involved,' because it simply is...you're no longer standed on a single game world of small/medium/large that's created from the main menu, but an entire 'universe' is created for you when you first start a Starbound quest. You'll get your own space ship, which can be decorated like a house, and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel. To see how big the game world is, zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them. It's an exciting thing to figure out on your first playthrough.  The game has objectives and a questline for you to go through, which makes the game interesting rather than Terraria's 'grind and get more powerful', which becomes stale through time. While there are plenty of boilerplate 'fetch' quests in Starbound, they'll force you to check out locations you haven't seen yet.   I actually like the increase in difficulty that Starbound has vs. Terraria - it's easy to adjust to, and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more. Getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game, since they are far more difficult to find than in Terraria, and random chests don't usually mean uber weapons are in them...but, mediocre ones, or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing, but worse at another (damage vs. speed). You won't be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile - at least, until you get the courage to leave the solar system - so, you'll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts.  Overall, if you loved Terraria but got tired of it, you won't want to miss this one - it's a bigger 'take' on Terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"Hi guys! HappyDays here looking at Starbound 1.0!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEC8pGTuwX0   Having played Starbound prior to the full release I was excited to see what the developers had changed moving in to a full version 1.0 release.  Initial impressions seem positive, movement and combat seem more dynamic. The intro is enjoyable with a few hidden items along the way. The developers have introduced an enemy the player must hunt throughout their adventure which is a nice addition!  One big thing I immediately noticed is that the initial healing item is now 'salve' instead of 'bandages.' I LOVE THIS as it gives a slower heal rate and makes combat more tactical rather than 'tank hits and spam bandages for massive healing. Salve heals 50hp over 10 seconds which means you cannot simply tank groups of enemies early on.  I will update this review as I explore more of the content but initial impressions seem great!",1,1
211820,Starbound,"All of my friends and my wife absolutely loved terreria. I didn't. By the time I decided to give it a go, everyone was so far ahead that I never got to experience that exploration, dicovering things for myself aspect of the game. Now, I am totally getting that from this game. I get to not only explore my own starting world (where I have built a pretty cool colony) but I also get to travel to other worlds and meet other civilizations and colonies. I am having a blast.  Now a terreria vetran may still tell you that this game isn't as good or whatever but it certainly is special to me. I am really enjoying sinking time into it.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Oh Starbound... will you ever reach the the greatness or even the fun standards from Terraria?  No... you won't... which is sad because I hoped this Game will be at least fun to play... it was in the beginning...  Then I realized it was just 'pure grind'  everything in this game is just that. GRIND.  Also the Fullscreen isn't working anymore... which is maybe just a temporary fail but it sucks... really...   It's just really sad that in 2014 when I purchased the Game... I thought it was very fun and a game that could reach the Fun Factor of Terraria... then over the years I realized nearly nothing would change with the game... don't get me wrong stuff was added over time... like races, items, weapons, monsters, npcs and so on...  But adding Mod Support in Early Access could already be a bad sign... because well developers CAN USE THIS ADVANTAGE TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED THE GAME FINISH IT instead of finishing it themselves  But no major or small update brought it even near of something like the 1.3 Update for Terraria...  But the game has a terrible developer behind it that with the massive amount of money they got from Starbound, are they using to, well, publish other games, maybe even start to develop other games, the developers moving locations and try to live in a more expensive town, what I heard bought real pets and so on... instead of FOCUSING EVERYTHING ON STARBOUND AND THEN WORRY ABOUT THE NEXT THING?  I' am very dissapointed Chucklefish...  Update 13th April 2016 Now, I originally didn't wanted to be so harsh on this game. Back in 2014 it actually was fun and this game still has potential. Now when the game is finally going to be 'released' I'll may take a second look and maybe even say: 'well NOW it's actually a Fun little Game!' Well even if I still can't compare it to Terraria. Other than that it does many things 'well enough' that its currently doing. Except for some broken things that I hope are fixed by now.   Well I should say what a 'perfect game' would look like to me...  Cheap  (or the price must justify the content)  Many Stuff to do  (say you must have many possibilities in the persistend game)  A lot of Content (Also features...)  Nice Developers  (I actually don't know much about Chucklefish, those accusations above could be wrong)  Nice Community (Thats Obvious)  Mod Support  (For a more Community Life Support)  Deep (When you still think you haven't seen and tried everything)  Singleplayer and Multiplayer (For both types of people who enjoy playing alone or with friends)  Original (Dont just be ruthless copy or ripoff of something else that is currently popular)  Creative (I always liked seeing things that I never seen before)  Focused (The Game should know what it wants it to be and who its target audience should be)  Replay Value (It should be enough fun so that you want to play it again and again, even get after the 100th time, you don't get bored)  Deep Lore (So I want to learn more about its content)  Great Controls (So that it feels great and responsible, not clunky as hell)  No Useless DLCs and Microtransactions  (When the DLC is actually ADDING CONTENT not just 'SELL SOMETHING SEPERATLEY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME')  Offline Playability (When you have no or bad internet)  Maybe someday everything of this will count for Starbound answell as it did for *cough* Terraria ;) (Well I do compare it alot to Terraria, do I? Even though I guess it got its Inspiration from it 'a bit'xD)  Alright there is one last positive thing I can say for Starbound since the first time I played it. The Soundtrack is amazing ;)  Maybe after it's 1.0 Release I'll think differently about it. Who knows?  But now? I still wouldn't recommend it.  Update 6th May 2016  Also something I noticed just recently is... through the new reviews... yes of course everytime when this game got updated... you lose all your characters... so?  I still don't recommend it.  Update 26th July 2016  A Question, how do you make a game better? By Removing Features and Content? What?  Update 27th July 2016  Compare Terraria to Starbound...  Terraria announced a new update! - Adds thousands of new Stuff! Starbound announced a new update! - Removes thousands of Things!  But really what the hell is going on with Starbound?!  Yeah I know what! Just remove all the Stuff that didn't quite work in the betas and alphas and call it a finished game. Also let the Mod Community finish the game. Even now, I've seen hundreds of Workshop Mods... Improved Interface, Better Customization, More Armors, More Weapons, Mechs, Many New Monsters, Better Ship Customization, Better Farming, More Inventory Space, More Items, New Planets and Biomes, More Outfits etc. etc. All of that THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME... What you see now as 'Mods' or rather 'Let the Community finish what we have started and announced to do from the Beginning Content'  Starbound had such a larger Budget from the Beginning compared to Terraria... WHAT THE FLYING BULLDONKEY HAPPENED WHIT IT!?  *Whispers* By the way it was nearly 5 years in development, from the idea to the 'finished product'",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"it's like a worse version of terraria, only it costs more",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"The game, frankly, was a hell of a lot better when I thought it was 'bare bones' but now I see it had more to offer before.  It felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you.  Now?  Well, theres this insanely half-baked and arbitrary 'story' you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses I have  EVER  seen in a video game.  Some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to:   Crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables, making it boring.   Un-needed crafting times of 0.5 to 10 seconds have been added since early access, which begs the question. Why even have them?   No longer feels like an exploration sandbox.   Race spesific ship AI was removed. (why?)   It also got a lot more annoying.   Guns STILL suck colossal dong.   Game feels like it has less than when I considered it 'bare bones'.   Start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason.   If they decide they want to actually improve their game, I'll change my reveiw as I have done with other things in the past but for now. This game is just flaming garbage compaired to what it was in early access.",-1,0
211820,Starbound,    DISCLAIMER: this review is based on my own opinions and may or may not differ from other opinions.,-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I loved this game, and I can't recommend it now. Now, before this gets written off as just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off reviewer because 'they broke my game,' I just wanna point out some things that were better before and for some reason are gone:  -Planets: Oh. My. God. Why did they make planets boring now? There used to be a randomizer for planets so you had a reason to explore and try to find the planet type you wanted with the weather you wanted in order to settle down for fun. Now you just run through the same few planet archetypes and be done with it. There's no fun in discovering a new planet now. Each one is the same as the last with minor variations.  -Monsters: Monster variety is gone. They did away with the randomizer and instead added biome specific mobs and kept in a couple of random monster parts, but not many.  -Crafting: Not a lot changed with crafting, except that they reduced what you could craft. Every crafting tier has only 2 weapons now. To make matters worse, everyone crafts the same weapons with endgame materials.  -The story: It's not so much epic as just a thing you do. It's not even needed to progress through planets of different difficulty. You could play the game and do anything you want without ever needing to touch the quests past the beginning ones (which are necessary to fix your ship). There's just no point to it.  -Random quests: Not. Random. Have fun running back and forth random locations looking for an NPC that the questgiver lost. Or you have to go deliver a thing. There's no actual randomness it's just those 2. At least as far as I saw and I've gone through like 100 planets.  And apparently there was a thing with pets but I have no experience so I can't comment on whether good or bad.  TL; DR: The game has a bunch of things that were gutted and are no longer fun. Because of this I can't recommend it as is. There are fun elements, but you'll soon be bored of planet exploration, which was the point of the game to begin with.   I recommend people on the fence just wait for more updates to add more stuff, and maybe even revamp some (looking at you planets. So disappointed). Otherwise it's just a normal sandbox. Dig, craft, build, fight. There used to be a great game and I believe there's one still.",-1,0
211820,Starbound,The game in it's self I would recommend however...Tiyl the big cheese of Chuckle Fish has no idea how to handle customers you don't abuse the people who support you and buy things from you... 'Hay yeah can I get a cheeseburger' 'Yeah sure here it is by the way your mentally challanged' 'Ok cool ♥♥♥♥ you from now on I'm going to macas'... He and a few others from CF have got some seriously bad press and quite frankly I think alot of people will not be buying from chuckle fish in the future because of the way they and others in the community have been treated if he handled complaints better I wouldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ when the game comes out but they abuse people cop when they whine is ridiculous there the people buying ♥♥♥♥ from you... If they want to be rude so be it... Suck it up be polite to them and there attitude will change and they will join your side and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing... Treat them like ♥♥♥♥ and call them brain dead and of course they will continue to carry on like a frigin 3 year old... Anyways If you want to support people who seriously call there fan base brain dead and blame the lack of development on them then go ahead the game is fun I just cant stand the people behind it.  UPDATE :  Games worth it get it if you like terraria or other games simiar in design.,-1,0
211820,Starbound,"I wish I could be kinder to this game, but Starbound (a.k.a. Feature Creep: The Official Game Of The Movie) just isn't that great.  Setting aside the farcically protracted development time, the long chain of broken promises from the developers, and the frustrating apologist community that refuses to entertain ANY criticism, the game never rises above being 'pretty neat, but impossible to recommend'. Planet-hopping in concept is really cool, and as block building-style games go, you have a lot of latitude to create some nice stuff, but much of the rest of the content is fairly vapid, and often only serves as an obstacle or chore that restricts you from exploration unless you participate in it to the game's satisfaction. Once you burn through all of the possible biomes and settlements the game can generate, and maybe build a thing or two, there's very little motivation to continue playing.  The changes from beta feel very much like one step forward and two steps back in terms of tooling the game for fun and player convenience. For example, instead of making mining more enjoyable, ore has just been made more easily available through other avenues for players who want to bypass it, essentially mooting one of the primary gameplay modes. No such luck, though, if you hate the game's combat, because Space Farmin' ain't gonna kill the story bosses for you. In that sense, Starbound is more like a mediocre platformer with a huge amount of padding between levels and an excessive amount of optional sandbox side content. Most of my 200+ hours of playtime are 'unearned', in the sense that the majority of them were spent planet-crawling or grinding for resources. In other words, sifting through randomly generated content just trying to find the one thing I needed. So maybe it's more like a sandbox that arms you with a plastic sieve and tells you someone dropped a quarter in it a week ago.  The story itself might charitably be described as 'serviceable', but the story missions are garbage. You can't build or dig anywhere to stop you from 'cheating', but Starbound's combat and platforming are too shallow and unrefined to stand on their own, not to mention the fact that the mission maps are SO poorly optimized that I consistently crash out unless I run the game in a tiny window, despite exceeding the minimum requirements. In fact, I have to regularly save &amp; quit every hour or so because there seems to be a memory leak issue where my graphics get corrupted. Did I mention you can sometimes irretrievably lose all of your teleporter bookmarks for no reason, a bug that has persisted for over a year? Seems like something you'd probably want to prioritize for release.  A game like this lives and dies on novelty, which is fine, but the path to that novelty is gated by tedious, uninventive resource grinding and weak action platforming that runs contrary to the developers' insistent sandbox rhetoric. Copy on the official website claims that Starbound allows you to 'create your own story' (unless you're playing a Novakid, who are completely excluded from the main storyline and still have no settlements, OOPS) and that there is 'no wrong way to play!', both of which are patently untrue with the way the player is constantly shackled to tutorials and story quests that only have one 'right answer' and staunchly refuse to let you think outside the box. There is no story or win state outside of playing the game exactly the way the developers intended, and for a game like this that promised so much and delivered on so little of it, that is quite unfortunate. Not only is the decision to make platforming and combat the 'core' gameplay experience misguided, it seems totally arbitrary, considering planet generation is clearly what had the most work put into it.  At this point, the game cannot be 'fixed' with more content, balance tweaks or fan mods. What it needed was a more focused and unified development cycle, and a team that actually listened to player feedback instead of insisting that being able to play a flute in space was more important than releasing on time, and that ship has sailed.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I purchased this game for my brother and I, an almost 30$ investent. I had played the game in the unstable betas a while back, and it had loads of potential. When I bought it, I fantasized about what amazing boss battles would be added, what new quests would be added to the outpost, how would they revamp the weapons, crafting, planets, ships. How amazing a central story arc would be. The game trailer had my hype levels through the interstellar roof. My main thought was: Could it even be better than before? The answer, my friends, appears to be no. In fact, the overall quality of the game has fallen drastically from what was there previously.  -The weapons have become less amazing, random, and awesome than before. It has a lack of rare weapons (the cool ones being nearly impossible to obtain,) daggers and hammers are practically useless, and class armor is generic at best. I, along with some other gaing friends, were expecting some awesome end-game set boosts like gliding for avians or endless energy during the day for florans. However these never came true, and armor found in chests is next to useless before even leaving your starter world. Not only that, but all low-teir (copper, iron, gold) weapons were completely removed from the game. Character tech has also recieved a downgrade, with a very small amount of upgrades, and only one in each of the now 3 categories that is worthwhile (spike ball, sprint, and triple jump.) The bubble tech no longer exists.  -The planet system no longer has difficulty sectors, but different teired stars, leading only to a mad dash to the glosest fiery planet for endgame loot. The temperature system has been replaced by the EPP, a barely-augmentable pack that is far too easy and relatively boring to make. Many of the RNG creatures have also become thngs of the past. The mechs, and amzing and fun planetary exploration machine, has been replaced by speeders so expensive that they become obsolete by the time you save enough pixels for them. The crew system, although beneficial, is a real hassle when it comes to upgrading your ship. Also the Erchius Ghost is a pain. Enough said.  The story had amazing potential. I loved every second of the tutorial (grabbing both the flower and the cape,) and I couldnt wait to see what the outpost had. After finally reaching it, I was met with three quests. Three. One for the techs, one for the ore mart, and one for dreadwing. Remember all of those fun personal quests? Gone. Remember spending a hour on mazebound to cash in both a quest and an enormous sense of achievemnt? Pointless. Then we get to the ark. The scan quests? Tedious and annoying. That eigth race everyone was speculating about? Never happened. I remembered being so hyped for the new story quests after beating the Hunting Caverns. But it turned out that every single on of these was a glorified trapped puzzle labyrinth, each with its own theme, and each boss chamber was just a rectangular room. No variation, no truly unique battles. Just hit until you die or it dies, staying in the same room. In fact, the planetary exploration system makes it so you can have end-game gear before you even do the Floran mission, leading to really a broken system. Even after beating it, the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth.  What Starbound desperately needs: -More inventive Boss Missions -A better exploration and teir system -More weapons and unique armors. -Better Techs and Mechs -A larger variation of creatures -The Outpost quests to return  A novel idea would be to have space pirates (a very realistic thing in a univese like Starbound's) that scales up in occurance and difficulty as you travel to better planets. When 'attacked,' you could either pay a fine or choose to board their Randomly generated ship of hostile enemies (of any race, even the non-playable ones.) Once you beat the underlings and possibly a mini-boss 'captain,' you could have a loot chest that also scales with the solar teir. Much like challenge dimensions, there would also be a hidden loot chest somehere in the ship. Once defeated, you would just go on your merry way.  As much as I love Starbound, until it gets some serious updates, I wont be playing it again. ",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"The early access was brilliant, better than this stable version.  Currently the game (1.0 release) has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced, underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end, with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades. It used to be a fun type of grind, but with the general need for more items (volume, as well as different type) to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating. Although the pace for upgrading your MM and Tech feels a bit better. The change to equipping items feels terrible, initially I thought I'd get used to it like a person normally would, but it feels too unnatural. You need to equip many items in general: melee weapon, ranged weapon, torches, rope, trash blocks, flashlight, health kits. That's mainly for exploring, even then more items can be added. And for some reason many items that you think would be single-handed are actually two-handed. Great! Even more switching to do!  The need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony. Go out into that vast universe - and become a farmer! It does get better, but takes away from the experience nonetheless.  The array of items and scenery is great; planets are much more interesting. Playing with friends has never been easier also!  It's got a lot of potential, it always had. They're holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores.  EDIT: I've deleted the comments that commented on my hours, I have at least 60 hours in total and that's a very conservative estimate.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"It's nice that you added a decent story, but all the quests now just feel like filler, including the sidequests.  I want to love this game, but I really can't anymore.  I remember when campfires were used as heat, and there was actually a point in moving to other planets other than just making a b-line to the nearest fiery star or frozen star, just to click on some objects to complete the quest, and then defeat a dungeon and then move onto the next star.  This game used to be great. There was actually a reason to go to some random ♥♥♥ planet in the middle of no where, but now there's literally no point other than to make a colony, which I don't even see how it's useful in anyway.  If you like a very short main story, this is a great game for you. If you like a game with a good long story that actual feels like an achievement doing stuff, don't get this game, or maybe you should have back a few updates ago.  I have to say, it's a fun game, and it's a change from Minecraft or Terraria, or any other sandbox games, but until the devs fix the problems many others have stated, it's not worth buying.  In the current state that this game is in, I do not recommend it, but if Chucklefish were to ever fix these problems, definitely get this game.     Please Chucklefish, fix this game. It has so much potential to be an amazing game, but you've just wasted it.  5.5/10",-1,1
211820,Starbound,The 1.0 release stripped almost all of the content that made the game fun. Planets and monsters are no longer random. Difficulty and progression are locked to your current tier - no more planet hopping to find cool items. Wait for another release when they can put the last 3 years worth of work back into the game,-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound at first looked like a regular 2D Survival game like Terraria. It didn't show me much information for me to be interrested. 'But hey, it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends', and oh boy! I was sure right!  This game combines everything that Terraria missed and combined with Minecraft's 'hugeness' and multiplayer. It may be a bit harsh at first, but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier. Small details that bring people together, just like instruments! You can play certain instruments in this game, and it even has a function to play as a band! It may seem small but its a huge thing to bring friends closer.   The usual laugh mid-game of someone's desgrace and the excitement when someone gets an 'OP Weapon'. The mining adventures and get you lost deep inside a planet. The adventures on the surface battling through monsters and discovering villages of a friendly race. Not to mention the breaks to play a music as a band.  This is a true game to play with friends.   I recommend 100% this game. Yes, it does has its flaws like wipes and character's deletion. But it's in beta. What did you expected? A Bug-free beta game?  Starbound is a great game and it's worth all the money I gave for it. Best of luck to the developers!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"A game too ambitious for its own good.  That's the tragic story of Starbound in a nutshell. I've played it numerous times since the early access, hoping that each iteration would bring forth new content - but in the end, none of those times felt like it was something worth revisiting. Even the fabled 1.0 update, where the game is now fully-fledged and no longer in early game access after three years doesn't feel anything like it should.  Starbound has a lot of great things going for it. The artstyle and presentation of the graphics, while slightly shoddy at times, is well animated and distinct. None of it feels muddied and it has a lot of charm with some of the non-random enemies. The music, while repetitive at times, is relaxing and comfy to listen to. Building your own ship, gathering up crew, making little colonies on planets stocked with people you've hired for the task, Starbound is keen on letting you explore the universe at your own pace.  But therein lies the biggest problem. Starbound is not just a sandbox game, but a sandbox game that is generated across an entire universe. There is only so much you can do before you start running into the same biomes, the same structures, the same villages, the same enemies and their attack patterns. This same problem feels eerily reminiscient of another game, No Man's Sky.  I will say this. Starbound, compared to when I last binged on it two to three years ago, has changed both for better and worse. There is a more streamlined story, more items to grab, more villages and towns you can visit, but with it, the unique quests you get from the Outpost has been virtually made obsolete, barring a handful of them. The crew you take on might as well be robots - they don't say much of anything and rather, their only flavor text is their name and mood. Even the main side characters get maybe a whole page of dialogue altogether outside of their recruitment missions. They don't say anything memorable. In fact, Starbound as a whole doesn't feel memorable. Why is it that its precursor and competition, Terraria, is that much better?  Because Terraria doesn't rely on random generation beyond its overworld. The enemies, items, and whatnot are all mostly going to stay the same in every world generated. Some might appear, some might vanish, but it is a far more static game than Starbound. In fact, Terraria doesn't even have that much of a plot. And yet, it's by far, the superior game due to the amount of unique items, enemies, armors, strategies, and so on and so forth. On the other hand, Starbound enemies, items, armors, and even the main playing strategy are pretty much the same. There are some neat abilities, but due to their random nature, your Beastmode Billywhacker will eventually be replaced by a Junky Moleseeker. In fact, a lot of it got downgraded from the last time I played. I remember when even the most random of enemies had some sort of special move that would force you to adapt. That's all been given to the unique monsters, which are just as dumb. Starbound's progression is extremely weak and the only thing that changes is that the numbers get higher as you go up the ranks. Terraria's difficult combines that with smarter and more varied enemies. Even the NPCs in Terraria are far more talkative than the ones in Starbound. In fact, if Terraria's graphics were better, there would almost be no reason to play Starbound.  All in all, Starbound is only fun if you wish to build and explore with friends. The game, much like our own universe, feels too sparse and dead to warrant anything other than a curious playthrough. It's very much just mining from world to world, running into the same structures and biomes, with little variation in between.  I can only recommend it if it's heavily discounted on sale and you got friends who can tag along. It's nowhere near being the total package that was promised all those years ago. Buy Terraria instead, since not only will you be saving five bucks or so, but you'll have way more fun than going through a developer's tired, broken dreams.  4/10.  ",-1,0
211820,Starbound,"This is a pretty honest review that I can give after playing through the story and going up until end-game.  To note, it took me 3 days of playing to do this.  In all honesty...I get the impression that work was put into areas that were not that important compared to others.  Progression is linear and simple, like so: - Get Thing - Use Thing to get to New Planets - Get New Thing on New Planets to make New New Thing - Use New New Thing to get to New New Planets to get New New New Thing  This rinses and repeats for up to 4 times.  Pros: - Pretty, lots of variety in some worlds, interesting concepts, nice dialogue - Plenty of vanity items to collect and display - Ship can be upgraded, which wasn't a thing back in Beta, which is great - There's actually a story now - Plenty of cool weapons  Cons: - There are only 4 rarities (White, Green, Blue, Purple) with no legendary weapons - Years in development yet feels incredibly basic still - Bugs and loading issues that cause you to stick in the air like a Minecraft Sever (Gross) - The Story is ♥♥♥♥ and short - The only 'truly legendary' weapon is ♥♥♥♥ - There are only 6 tiers of armor - There are only 5 mounts - Crew are useless - Very little 'rare' or 'exciting' content that requires you to grind to be satisfied - Up until end-game it's difficult to farm up resources for specific armor, and it ends up being easier to loot weapons, sell them to vendors, and buy the armor - Various 'gates' throughout the galaxy around various stars yet they all lead back to The Ark (even though you have a permanent teleport to there) - Very little missions outside of the Main Story - No reason to build houses other than for purely cosmetic reasons simply because you ship can hold everything - All workshops have roughly 3 tiers of upgrading and don't unlock anything interesting - You have to farm around planets for days to find theme-based equipment - Pets are useless, but admittedly cute, so that's not all bad - No 'large' or legendary monsters. There used to be some in beta that dropped epic gear. - Challenge areas are no challenge and the loot is terrible - Mystery bags are just horrible. Literally horrible. There's no point doing quests for the measly pixels and all of 1 matter manipulator core - No epic rewards for finish the main story, admittedly the most you get is, literally, a thank you card.  All in all, it's not worth it at the moment, even with it's official release. It just feels very lackluster and bare-bones for what was meant to be a long time coming. Terraria made it's way in less time and had WAY more content than this.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound holds a special place in my heart. I've had the game since 0.1, and on multiple steam accounts. The game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around, but it never QUITE made it.  All of that changed with the recent 1.0 update, marking the full release of the game.  You know have a fully pledged story, with interesting and deep characters, insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8+ bosses. Talking about bosses, they range from everything between a spider made of flesh, to a penguin in a futuristic war machine. Every boss is very unique, and their attacks never cease to suprise me.  There are 6 classes to choose from; A robot, A fish, A plant, A collection of gas, An ape and of course human. This sounds very bazare, but as soon as you create your character, you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory.  Starbound is a sandbox gme, and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be. You can choose to never mine a single peice of ore, never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship, or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds. There is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture, which comes in great use with the colony system.  The colony system consists of you creating a house, and putting a colony deed inside. The colony deeds cost 750 pixels (the ingame currency). You can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves, or weapons and armor. You can get everything from a merchant to a guard, and they all come together with the procedural quest system.  Quests (That arent outpost or story related) are always procedually generated, yet they're still all very unique and fun to do. The people who will give them to you are either random NPC's or inhabitants of your colony.  If you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific NPC, will he request to join you on your adventure, as a companion. It is only possible to have to companions with you at all times, but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound. The sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell, as you can either get companions by making colonies, ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries.  If you get enough companions on your ship (You can have as many as you want, just only two with you) your ship will get bigger, leaving you with more room.  There is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes, and deep and interesting dungeons.  The weapons of Starbound; The weapons come in many shapes and forms, some silly and some deadly. They, like so much else in this game, have prodcedurally generated stats and looks, which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find.  Verdict: If you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create, and many unique enemies and weapons, you're at the right place. Starbound is huge, and for the gamer that likes to read, there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to. There are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets, just waiting for you to find them.  9/10",1,1

211820,Starbound,"Y'all saying this games not as good as it used to be, lmao. At the time of writing this review i have somewhere around 700-800 hours in starbound. its an ok game yes things have changed yes there was neat things in the beta.  thats the thing it was a beta. not everything is going to be the same. honestly i think the new version is pretty ok, because i got bored of the old versions. to be fair it could have been better. but yall are saying this is the better no mans sky. no mans sky is 60 dollars this is 15 dollars  stop expecting gold to come out of 15 dollars heck look what 60 dollars got no mans sky",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Ok, so Starbound, it's fun! I mean, you can build, craft, fight, etc. Like Terraria, but in SPAAAAAAAAAACE! Or that's what people say, that Starbound is just Terraria in space. Which is false, to me anyway. Starbound is so much more open-ended, expansive, etc. than Terraria (In my opinion anyway). Anyway, now for my reasons as to why you should get the game.     Just Came out of Early Access. A lot of people before were whining about how little there was to do, but now that it updated to 1.0, you can expect a buttload of stuff! I have reached the endgame, and I still haven't discovered everything myself. So there will be no shortage of content.     Easy Modding And if you hypothetically do discover everything in the game, there is a very active community just pumping out mods which are as simple to download as a click of a button! Hell, you can even modify and make your own weapons/items with a program like StarCheat which is so easy to do, even I managed to do it!     In-depth Exploration Many people complain that all the planets are very similar, and I think that's because they just skim the surface of the planet and then claim it's not original enough. I'm sure if they took the time to look the planet over, you'll discover so many cool places and strangely unique NPCS. Just give it a chance before you hop onto the next Radioactive Star.    Story/Characters Ok, so serious talk here, shame on anyone who says the story is too simple, like seriously screw you. You should not be expecting Oscar worthy writing from a game based on exploration, and adventure. It's a wise decision by the Devs to allow the game's story to be simple, and allow it promote exploration. I won't spoil the story here, but honestly get the game and experience it yourself. The story and characters, simple as they may be, are extremely colourful and fun, trust me.     Better than Terraria It's better than Terraria.   Oh and another point, stop comparing Starbound to Terraria. 'But waah they're both games with pixel graphics and crafting and-' No shut up. You should never compare games together unless if they are extremely similar, and Starbound and Terraria are two totally different experiences. Yes, so what if they both have pixel graphics and crafting? Just because they share just those two aspects is so ground to start comparing the two. Next, you'll be telling me Terraria is just 2D Minecraft, seriously, stop it.  Well, that was my first review. A few final words. Honestly, just get Starbound now, even if you like it just a little. It's a wonderful, and colourful experience unlike any other which really deserves more attention, And c'mon, it's only 10 bucks.  (PS, that last point about Starbound being better than Terraria was meant to be a joke, not an actual point as to why you should get the game.)  EDIT: BTW Thanks to the guy who pointed out some grammatical mistakes I made.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound is essentially Terraria... if Terraria were a mediocre amalgamation of 15 genres at once. The best word to describe Starbound is tedious. Everything you do in this game is tedious:  Mining takes forever, and one misstep can get you killed. This wouldn't be a problem if the controls worked well, but they are extremely awkward. Also, in survival mode you lose money and drop all your important items on death, so if you die somewhere where you can't get them you're basically screwed.  Farming is absolutely pointless. The plants take way too long to grow, planting the seeds and watering them take forever, and it makes almost no money. Not to mention the fact that inventory management is incredibly awkward and frustrating.   Exploration is boring as hell. Planets are all just generic biomes like desert and forest and plains. Also, there's really no point to building a base on a planet because it's just a waste of resources and you can just put all your things on your ship. Speaking of the ship, it is very minimalistic. There's no deep customization, just (exteremely expensive) size upgrades. Also, it is incredibly slow. The way you travel between planets is just clicking on it and then waiting. There's no interesting gameplay of any description. The space travel is nothing but a gimmick.  The story really has no place in this game. There is absolutely zero orignality to it. Just the standard find all the things to kill the giant monster. I'd say the character interactions are pointless, but you can barely even call them interactions. You have no choices, and the text always goes by too fast or too slow. Also, the dialogue is dull as dishwater.  Gear is horribly implemented. It works similarly to something like Borderlands or Diablo, so you'll be getting tons of useless items that clutter your inventory. And the combat is basic as hell. Every enemy functions more or less the same.  In conclusion, this game is just a lesser Terraria which is more expensive for no reason. Please don't waste your time and money, and play Terraria instead.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Something I've always disliked about Minecraft is that there was no real adventure to talk of. This is the complete opposite, always on the go, always discovering new things.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound is now out and I have completed the story so I can give a proper review of it. I will be covering what I consider to be the main aspects of the game.  Story-8/10 The story of the game is that a big monster blew up Earth and you escaped so you now have to find 6 artifacts that open the gate to the monster. (You find this out in the first hour.) The story has that Bethesda feel, where the game is like 'oh no, this thing happened and you have to do something!,' but you can just ignore it and do your own thing. The story is an interesting aspect, and actually takes you to the different planet types so you have time to upgrade your armor and weapons. I think that story isn't completely necessary, but it works well with the concepts already established.  Combat-9/10 The sword-and-gunplay is fun and focuses on dodging enemies. Your 'Matter Manipulator,' which is a building tool, can be useful for creating cover and such, but some enemies can go through walls. Each 2-handed weapon has a special ability, like grenade launchers and flashlights on guns or spin slashes and warp slashes on swords. There is a variety of weapons, allowing a ton of different playstyles. The bosses in the game are also very well designed and offer up a challenge when you first fight them. These bosses are located in developer-designed dungeons that have many secrets located in them. The combat never gets stale and fights are always interesting in one way or another.  Exploration-5/10 This aspect isn't the best part of the game. You usually see the same biomes and monsters over and over and while some monsters are randomly generated, by the end of the story you've seen all of the environments in the game already. It is fun at the start of the game, but it quickly gets stale and boring. Randomly generated dungeons are cool, but you often find the same style of dungeon as well.  Building-9/10 Building in the game is surprisingly deep and interesting. The colony system offers up an interesting thing to do after the story. The foreground and background building is similar to Terraria, but the game actually offers a good reason to build decorated houses so different tenants move in. This is one of my favorite parts of the game and I have spent hours searching for the right materials for my houses, which leads me to find new things in the game as well.  Soundtrack-10/10 The soundtrack in this game is beautiful and the main theme is one of the most memorable tracks that I have ever heard in games. I cannot stress enough that the soundtrack is worth buying and it adds a layer of charm to the game that I rarely see.  Overall-8/10 Starbound is not the best game ever made, but it definitely has a large amount of content that makes the game interesting for hours. It seems that this game was a board that ideas were thrown at, and some of those ideas stuck and mixed really well. The game also has a kind of charm to it that you don't see in AAA games. Starbound has been a great project to watch as it grew from alpha to beta, and finally to 1.0. Starbound has, in fact, left orbit and hopefully will go interstellar in further updates.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound started off promising and somehow got worse instead of better over the course of its dev cycle. The game has fully released now but still feels virtually identical to the earliest builds. The interface is clunky and terrible, the progression system and balancing are all over the place, the combat feels imprecise and every planet is basically a palette swap of the last. At the end of the day, it hasn't lived up to any of the promises Chucklefish made during development and the final version is just boring.   Save your money and get Terraria instead.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Do not buy this, the developers are very rude and bans anyone who gives negative feedback on their forums.  EDIT 07/08/2016;  Update to this; The game is still incredibly bug-riddled despite being 'Released from beta', and there are massive FPS drops at seemingly random times. I'm running a pretty high-mid end gaming PC, and most of the time it averages 20 FPS in this game, despite being able to run pretty much any other game on very high settings at &gt;72 FPS.  If you want to buy it, wait a little. Don't put your money down for it if you haven't already done so.   This is not at all a full 1.0 version. Don't be fooled.  To add to it; You make 15 trading cards, but there's not a single Novakid card, despite there only being 7 races, yet you can still manage to add a human game developer card? That's even dafter than I am.  Don't make a promise if you never want to do anything with it. Considering how many promises they've made and failed to deliver on, I'm starting to not be very surprised at all by them failing to deliver anything competent.  Chucklefish was a mistake.",-1,0

211820,Starbound,"Time to rewrite this old thing now since it's out of EA. Let's start with an admittedly bad metaphor.  Imagine you see a food stand that makes sandwiches. They have only one kind of sandwich, the 'Mystery Sub,' but it's promised to have the ingredients you like on it. Specifically, pickles, butter, and white american cheese, with just a little bit of mayo. It's also pretty cheap, so you order a sandwich. You're told it'll be ready in five minutes.  Those five minutes go by, but still no sandwich. So you go up and ask about it and the guy at the stand says he just started in the food service industry yesterday, and he misjudged how long it would take. Since he's just starting out and he says it'll be the best sandwich ever, you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a little while.  After half an hour of waiting, he finally gives you your sandwich. You decide to open it to see what's in the 'best sandwich ever,' and you take a look at it.  Mayo. Lots of mayo. With one pickle, a big glob of butter, and half a piece of that awesome cheese you like all placed in different corners on the bread, covered in that white goop. In other words, it's technically what you ordered, but it's not half as good as you expected it to be, and was given to you in much more time than you were told it was going to take originally.  Starbound is that sandwich. It has everything they said it would have; exploration, building, even a few dark themes. So technically everything they said it would be. But there isn't nearly enough of that stuff, and mostly samey fetch quests and grinding. The all-important story is shallow and derivative, with every quest pretty much being 'scan random crap, go though dungeon, kill boss.' Rinse and repeat.  Over all, it's not a bad game. It has plenty of stuff to keep you busy for a while, with tons of cosmetics and building items. I would even say the building system is better and more fun than Terraria. But there just isn't enough of everything else that would make it fun and unique; as the old saying goes, it's as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle.  There's plenty of bad stuff that happened in development; with the devs, with the missed release dates, and plenty of other problems. I'm not going to go into it here; if you haven't heard of all the problems with the development and the devs themselves and are interested, you can look it up yourself. God knows you'd get a better explanation from anyone other than me.  So I'll judge it on what it has in it now, not what happened in development in the past. And for me, in it's current state it's a resounding 'meh.' Good for one or two playthoughs, but you'll probably get bored of it before you even get to experience most of the main features. I still haven't even tried the colony stuff, and I did very little farming after 1.0. It's only fifteen bucks though, so if you think thirty or so hours is enough for that price, then go for it I guess. Will you get as much play out of it as, say, Terraria though? No, probably not.  I'm sure I've 'gotten my money's worth' out of it while it was in EA, but I still don't like the game much, so I'm giving it a negative review. Maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 for me.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"In regards to the 1.0 update: If you don't already have the game and were hoping that the big 1.0 update would add a new world of content that would change things forever, you're probably going to be let down. To summarize what the update does; the early-access version of the game essentially involved Chucklefish cramming a bunch of content in the game to make it bigger. They added single-player missions, bosses, and a certain level of progression, but it was all kind of shallow and these elements were purely added just to have more things to do. So finally what this big update does is gives these missions and the game proper plot and progression. There are now lengthier, more plot-involved quests that make more sense than just 'I'm doing this quest because an NPC told me to for the hell of it,' (which is pretty much how quests were in early-access). The story is actually something that develops as you play rather than being explained in a dialogue box at the start like previous versions. For the most part, that's all this update does. Yes, they DID add some new stuff, but the main purpose of this update was to refine and complete the game so that it no longer has that early-access appearance and feel. If you enjoyed/think you'd enjoy the content that was in previous versions of the game, then you might consider Starbound worth a playthrough/replaythrough. On the other hand, if you weren't previously impressed, then there's probably not a whole lot added in this latest update that will change your mind. Regardless, Starbound as a whole is a really good game. It may seem a bit lacking compared to Terraria, but it's very easy to enjoy its unique elements such as exploration, looting, and colonization.",1,1

211820,Starbound,"So close, yet so far.  Short: Terraria &gt; Starbound  Long: The quests are really boring (MMO style). Scan this fight the boss get the artifact come back repeat. Or, find this dude kill the hostage takers bring him back. Or, bring me 4 Silver ore, make Silver bars, make the equipment and bring it to my friend. I'd be fine with that but the rewards are totally not worth it, most of the time you get a 'suprise bag' wich contains either a M.M. Upgrade Module or a Tech Card, that would be cool and all but you get a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of these if you just explore the surface of a planet. I wouldn't mind that too much but you need to complete the main Story to unlock all Shops in the Outpost (Hub like area)The boss fights are really, really, really boring. They're not hard, they just take a long long time to complete. Especially the last boss fight took me about 10 minutes but I didn't take much damage at all. Compared to Terraria the boss fights are unsatisfying and boring. Building a colony on a planet has no real use. You can upgrade your ship upto five (?) times and at that point you have way too much spare space already. Yes building a colony is cool and all but there is no real point to it since all you really get from it is pixels (the currency) and in the endgame you'll already have enough of them. If you enjoyed Terraria you'll mostlikley enjoy Starbound too because the gample is pretty much the same. If you haven't bought Terraria yet, buy it over Starbound.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"The game is like space Terraria but much less to do.  You know the saying? The journey is more important than the destination. Well the journey sucks in this game and there is no destination  Pros:  • Space. • So many interesting worlds and sets. • Missions and story have great aesthetic. • Ships are cool • Decent variety of planets. • Building is easy and the variety of building materials allows for a lot of creativity. • Building your ship can be super cool • There are some very neat random dungeons • The races are very creative • The game is fun with friends  Cons:  • Very VERY limited things you can craft compared to a game like terraria. • Hunger is stupid • Crew system is super underwhelming • A lot of things in the game that feel worthless such as pets, crafting weapons, buying basically anything from merchants. • Way, way, WAY too easy to find everything in the game. Every tear of ores can be found in around 30 minutes of being on your first planet with the ore, and then you never need to mine for it again. • The game has a very short cap. You finish everything you can do in the game after hardly any work.  • Quests that aren't in the main story are abysmal. There are like 3 different quests and they all suck. Go get this, kill this, or bring this to this person. They terrible payout so there is no incentive to do them at all. • Money is super easy to come by and not used for like anything, making it virtually worthless • The character customization options are actually very disappointing both at the character creation and throughout the game • The game is extremely linear for a sandbox, you have very specific paths to take until the end where is seems like they thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥, we need to give players multiple options for armor in a sandbox game”  Summary:  In the end, a lot of the gameplay mechanics seem not thought through and kind of worthless. The game is very incoherent at times, and worst of all, when you get to final tier of armor it is the most disappointing and unsatisfying thing in the game. The only way I'd recommend this game is if you really REALLY liked building and making a town, even then there are better games for that. Because that is the only thing in this game that requires any effort, but that has no payout besides being able to see a ton of people in your town. It’s very disappointing, because the beginning of the game is so fun and new, but as that feeling goes away, you get a very big disappointment. I hope for the game to improve as I’m sure the developers will continue to add to it. But until then, it is a no from me.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"  With over 60 hours played, I can guarantee you ten of those hours sloughing through the decievingly short main campaign and grinding for resources, while the rest of the time I was playing an okay vertical Stardew Valley. Aside from accompanying a friend's mission with a Banjo loadout or trying out the newer mods that weren't fortunate enough to be merged with the final game, the base game leaves much to be desired.  One of the biggest complaints is how badly the framerates could get fudged in a 2D platformer. You typically see a good 20-30 frame loss every time there are particle effects on screen, a large sprite is rendered, or, god forbid, witness a large sprite with alpha channels while hovering over it with the research tool. To put it into perspective, the credit sequence which is crawling text with a slideshow beside it amounts to a whopping 14 fps. That's impressive. It was also a fitting finale that summed up how this game shipped: through massive incompotence, yet kept afloat by a passionate community that has just the right amount of obnoxiousness to be unappealing yet get work done.  If you are a fan of platformers with an expansive sandbox building system, this is very likely a purchase. As it is now, I could not personally recommend this to anyone else until they revisit the main campaign, post-game content, and what is most likely the most shameful resource hog I have seen in a while. Kudos to the first patch that landed, however, as it effectively kept our server from crashing every two hours from a memory leak. These kinds of changes along with what the modding community has been able to accomplish within the last week could mean good things later this year.     Special thanks to Nutmeg, shoutout to simpleflips, love you mom",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"So after a 5 year wait, it's finally released. After all that time, with content updates and changing basically everything in the game, Chucklefish has managed to deliver something truly dull and uninspiring.   Starbound is a fabulous premise, a universe full of potential. After spending some time with the final release, I am left with one question:  That's it?  The quests and story that I've been waiting for the biggest let down. The main quest consists of 2 types of mission:   1. Find a settlement of the specified race and scan their furniture. 2. Travel to a pre-made level and fight a boss at the end.  The side quests consist of 3 types of missions:  1. Deliver an object or escort a person to another person on the planet. Often times this second person is right next to the first person. 2. Kill an enemy for someone. 3. Collect ore or some other item for someone.  The rest of the game, as best as I can tell, is collecting stuff and building other stuff. You can set up a colony, but why would you? So you can get more tedious and boring quests? So you can have a farm? A universe of endless possibilities and farming is the most creative thing you could come up with?  One other thing I noticed is that the monsters seem to have gotten less unique. There are some that still seem to be randomly generated per planet, but there are a few that are on every planet. I don't know if that's a bug or not, but it wasn't like this before.  So after a 5+ year wait, I'm left with a game that has redefined blandness and squandered potential. No, I still can't recommend this game. I don't even want to bother finishing it just to finish it.  At least the soundtrack is still good. But that's it.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"edit: fixed some grammar here and there  During the Early Alpha I was like 'This is good. There's lot of potential!'. Had fun for a few days, especially in multi with a friend. But still it seemed too much unfinished, and so we decided to wait for the final version. A year or so later, when the final launched, we tried it again. It seemed fun at the beginning, they fixed something here and there, balanced it out. It was engaging again for a few more days. I now have played I think a dozen hours on the final version, between single and multiplayer, and finally decided to write this review. (steam reports more hours because I forgot it open a couple of times)  The dev team sadly fell in the old procedural development rabbit hole, and understandably couldn't get out of it. The content seems a lot, but it's really not. The whole mass of the content is in the graphic assets, but for the rest there's almost nothing. Let me get in detail:  1) There are like 3 quests repeated over and over the whole galaxy, including the main questline. The superficiality of the sidequests is evident when you find different villages and you always get the same quest, literally the same one on every planet, from 10 cramped up npcs. This is also apparent with the main questline, that consists of those 4-5 ad hoc maps (unreachable otherwise) where at the end you get to kill a boss (and boy they are all easy to beat).  2) Another major turn-off is the main story. I really think that making the main questline obbligatory for the player goes against everything that a sandbox game is.  3) The sub-biomes are another big problem, they are very superficial too. You basically find always the same 2-3 ones (gnomes, slime, small houses underground, etc). These sub-biomes never give you anything special, nor they have any background story or anything. The crates you find, and you always find them by the dozens, have always the same loot, because each of the few different star types has the same exact loot for all its planets.  4) And then we have the colonies system. You find a planet, build a house, and a random guy teleports in. He does nothing. He will rarely give you one of the same 2-3 quests (they are exactly the same as the sidequests in the game) and then, when he wants, he'll give you finally the chance to hire him (but you don't actually need a crew in the game, and it has no utility whatsoever).  I don't recommend this game. Maybe only discounted and if you plan to play in multiplayer with a friend. Otherwise don't waste money.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"I've given this game three years and finally came back and finished the final release with a buddy of mine, and at the end of this glorious storyline he summed it up perfectly. 'This game feels like it was completed by a couple of high schoolers, NONE of which have ANY creativity.' Literally, nothing but fetch quests. Like a single player MMO. It gets repetitive really fast.  If you've already played Terraria and beat it, this game scratches that itch. That sandbox 2D itch. If you haven't, don't waste your time and money on this one. Go play Terraria.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"tl;dr: I wouldn't buy it unless you have a friend that has it but even then I duno. Pretty much mod the crap out of the game to make it worth while cause I duno what the developers were doing over the last few years :(  Oh after editing a bit I figured out what i'm exactly feeling about this game. It feels like this should have been the beta and now we are waiting on the real game. So this review is my first and probably terrible but it is mine and if anything I hope the 5 people on my friends list that have this in their wishlist are a bit more informed and hopefull avoid this shallow game.  Cool Stuff- -First couple of story missions -Space ship upgrading (granted its only room sizes w.e still cool) -Multpile races -Different planet types Trying to think of more -Procedural weapons maybe -Cool special moves on weapons -Underwater and Outerspace bases -Crew recruting -Colony/Tenants -Building in this game is a breeze and beautiful so it has that going for it I guess ill give it that -Hand created enemies -Boring but rewarding random fetch quests ( you kill some cool units sometimes and i've mostly gotten cool things as rewards) -Rainbow knight  Not Cool Stuff- -Story missions after first couple -Space magic is really dumb ( i wanted to like it but they should have left that to terraria ) God theres a lot -No novakid npcs or tenants ( i feel like they don't even exist, i guess i could play one ) -Crafting is like straight up trash as far as weapons are concerned -Magma, Ocean, and Poison worlds ( no reason to explore except for ore and only place to really use the useless boat ) -I felt like the techs were cooler in the betas back a couple years ago -Hoverbike ( to many giant hills to really take advantage of it and it takes tons of damage ) -The crew recruiting is cool the crew members themselves are useless -Omega super god aweful boring enemies -Stupid enemy ai that just runs into you over and over, really boring -Not so random random enemy generation ( cool concept but ive seen the same face on the same body type 100 time but this time he has spikes on his back ) -Pets are about as dumb and usless as the crew sadly ( once again cool concept ) -Unique weapons or legendaries are boring and usually really weak ( i did like the magna orb though ) This is going to be to long maybe? -Moons are dumb ( go to moon with nothing on it except for fuel, that is just plain old fluff content ) -Asteroids are meh ( less boring then moons but no real reason to go there ) -Everything about the UI sucks especially for chests ( you need mods ) -Basically a lot of stuff is just bland except for all the things that were once previously mods of some sort that got inject into the official game like railing was really cool and the novakid stuff which I found out was really a original idea but evolved from a much cool race call the umm Anyemods or something Anodynes    Ya I don't know. I'm going to keep playing it because i'm seeing some interesting mods that change things to better fit how I want to play but I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone. Mods seem to be the only way i'm going to make it through my first playthrough because it is just so boring.   I played this thing a bit around the time of the initial release and then kept tabs on the dev blog ( like had it as my home page ) for a while and I felt like what they were showing was really cool and then it just took them forever to make. I am not a developer so I don't know what it takes to develope a game like this but when like right out of the gate they were like it's going to be out 'blah blah' or wait no 'later blah' I grew a bit skeptical of the game really coming out so after a few years this game was a complete distant memory.  So where are we? I'm what a week or more after the release of 1.0 after not playing this game since pretty much 3 -4 years ago and it still feels like it has no idea what it wants to be.  The long of it for as long as this has become is that I guess I was expecting more from a game that seemed to have so much going for it. This games just regular? Bland maybe I duno. Maybe I was expectin personalized quests for each race or something. I mean so far the quest system that I was looking forward to is just really really bad. I liked the space station mission and was like this is cool, then there was the floran one and was like woah I really like this and by the hylotl and avian or w.e the birds were called again I was pretty much like 'ya this is just boring now'. Oh and jesus that looking for artifact things with the manipulator that was just bad...ya just bad... really bad.  I really wanted to love this game. A game shouldn't make you feel sorry for it ya know, like woah this and this is kinda cool but I don't know what happened with the rest of you sorta feeling?",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,Well what can i say. I got 1200h+ Hours played. Yes i bought the completely Overkill Pack the DLC's and supported the game. But after microtransactions and more and more DLC's i had to give it a bad review. They were promising free content and instead we got paid DLC's and microtransactions. So Overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making.  Don't get me wrong its one of my favorite games. But if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on DLC's that will come out over time. Because even with a -75% sale on everything the game with everything costs ~33€. And after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest DLC.  So what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game. The content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think.   Also playing with 'publics' (people you don't know) can be pretty annoying. It's ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them.   So if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on DLC and maybe microtransactions (for Weapon Skins which are cosmetic) and get yourself into a group to play Payday with.,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Update: It appears that Starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills. This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.  Original Review:  My friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...  So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.  That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release 'We will not ever have microtransactions.' And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.  Last year, there were a series of 'what's next' audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.  Last year, we had 'Crimefest,' where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.  Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were 'FBI Files' (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.  This year, Overkill did a 'Hype Train' event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get 'hype-fuel' points. With enough 'hype-fuel,' rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this 'Mask Pack 2.0.' It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.  And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.  Overkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats. I truly hope your company goes out of business.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"A money-obsessed pale imitation of the first game.  Payday 1 was essentially 'Left 4 Dead, except bank robbers.' It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.  Payday 2 is nothing like the first game.  The sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.  It gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.  The game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.  The game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.  The new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?  Game use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.  Am I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall.   For what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.  All in all a disaster, right from the start.

The same approach is being used here, but in adding this system, Overkill harshly nerfed all existing weapons - including those which players paid for as part of DLC packages.  In order to give players an incentive to pay for skins via microtransactions, existing equipment has been made insufficient to achieve the challenges that already existed in the game prior to the launch of this system. We aren't being urged to buy microtransactions in order to take on more difficult challenges added alongside these new skins - we're being robbed of our existing tools, tools we earned through hours of gameplay or purchased for real money, and then sold a -chance- of regaining the same level of power we enjoyed previously.

The addition of microtransactions is not only a complete contradiction to statements they made earlier, but also an idiotic decision.

Then our reward for our efforts and loyalty was another way for them to squeeze money from us. I'm sorry, but this is just not right. All this aside from the written word from said devs stating that microtransactions would NEVER be introduced into the game.   So, with lies about in game content and more lies about DLC which has been purchased and never released (the Completely Overkill Pack, FYI) it's hard to trust Overkill anymore.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Hey so this is a game that I really liked at first. I played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an up-and-coming indie team. I was right. It was fun. PAYDAY was an enticing, original game that knew not to take itself too seriously. I very much liked the idea. The sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original; as well as elaborating on the purposely far-fetched story. I thought PAYDAY 2 was an amazing game. That all changed when PAY2WIN arrived... They started with a few cheap DLCs. What's the harm, right? Pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point, these days. It's a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little. I honestly prefer a few DLCs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesn't forget you exist (COD). However, I soon found out that what PAYDAY 2 had planned was far worse than anything Call of Duty has EVER done. Overkill released DLC after DLC after DLC after DLC. They just kept coming. Each one more 'elaborate' than the last. If you call paying $5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate. They incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purpose-defeating advantage. They're essentially payed cheat codes, in the sense that a lot of these DLCs pretty much make the game EZ mode. I honestly think that Overkill does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about their 'community' anymore. All they seem to know or care about these days is that DLC=$$$. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off is this new 'Black Market Update' or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they called it. It's literally a copy-paste of the Arms Deal Update from CS:GO. LITERALLY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING. I mean I understand that they're purposely making this update resemble Counter-Strike, but I don't get why. Obviously it's because CS:GO keys and crates have made Valve a fortune, but what's with the unapologetic rip-off of Valve's style? Are they trying to be ironic? Because it's not ironic. It's not funny, or witty, or clever, or even mildly amusing. The whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes Overkill look like the money-grubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO  ANYONE . A couple of years ago, I would have told all of my friends about how fun and original PAYDAY 2 was, and I did; but this game and its devs are garbage now.

The gunplay is nice, the skills give tons of different playstyles, the heists are enjoyable, and the music is amazing.

And that's not a bad thing; it's great, actually. If they actually ♥♥♥♥ing listened to their community, that is, instead of just pretending to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people that play it. Overkill loves money, never forget it. They release tons of DLC, did a whole 'completely free event' back in the Spring where you had to buy DLC to unlock more rewards, and now did another 'completely free event' where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts.  Now, whether or not you consider this Pay 2 Win or not is your opinion, as it is a coop game. But it's still ♥♥♥♥ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event, have them work hard to get all the rewards, then day ♥♥♥♥ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Come ON Overkill. I love this game, seriously, I really do. I haven't wracked up thousands of hours, no, because I don't game much, but this was the first game in my Steam library to break a hundred hours, and then 200 not long after. I was addicted, I was hooked, I joined Facebook Groups dedicated to organizing all-nighter crime sprees on Skype and TeamSpeak. It was phenomenal. The gameplay was amazing. The game was based almost entirely on skill and persistence, teamwork.  Now? Come on guys. I could forgive the DLC stream, I was working full hours back when it started so I could keep up. I could forgive the letdown of Crimefest, I didn't pay that much attention anyway. You guys went from consistently updating the game with ACTUAL improvements, focused on bug fixes, detailed missions and new weapons that created whole new playstyles, to microtransactions, nerfing weapons to practically make the skins mandatory, and not even nerfing them well, resulting in the entire balance between weapon types being thrown off, breaking the game.  We get it, you want our money. You're a game developer who, only a couple of years ago, was fresh on the block. Then you managed to crank out an absolute masterpiece, you couldn't handle the boom in media attention and community growth, and you got carried away. You know what? I can forgive that. I can forgive you for trying microtransactions, and skins, and drops. I can forgive you, for trying new things. You are now a new BIG game developer on the block, instead of a new SMALL one. You'll make mistakes. I can forgive that.  But I cannot forgive the lying and manipulation you've done to the community. One of the best gaming communities outside the professional gaming circuit. A false apology, refusals to remove the failed tests despite the damage they've done, news blackouts...  We trusted you guys. You gave us an INCREDIBLE game, you were doing SO WELL.

I don't play this game anymore, I haven't for around 3-4+ months now (From when this review was made), and I don't plan on coming back to it again, especially at the rate that it's going.  Can I just point out before I state the obvious that this p*ss poor compnay, has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people, are actually tired of their s*%t?  They promised things like safe house customization, a new enemy, and a few other things here and there. Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No. Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.  Not to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's 'New content' when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII. It's basically saying 'We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons.'  Now then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.  Talk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist  http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv  Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdYRBDMJpI   'The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER' Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.  1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face. The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system. 'Oh that's just like CSGO though!' Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose. Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade. 'Oh you don't want the crate?' CSGO would say, 'Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!' Payday = 'Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch.'  2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!  3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT. I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.  Ending = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it? F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to. It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.  Fight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing? Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it! Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up. Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you  http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gif   Edit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation. Really? That's, it?

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I got 700h+ on record, bought almost all DLCs and now the developer breaks promises (no microtransactions) and adds paid stat boosting skins to weapons. Can't recommend the game as long as this feature is not changed to at least only cosmetical skins.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2 would be a much better game if its developers respected its audience. The game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of DLC which brings a noticeable power creep in, despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just pre-orders.  It is a four-player co-op shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of AI-controlled police. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead's model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities, that's the model Payday 2 went with. As you level your character up though, you get new abilities, and you acquire new weapons to fight with.  Mask customization is probably the highlight of the game, with there being an enormous collection of masks, materials for them to be 'made' out of, patterns to put on them, and colors for those patterns to be. You can make some really fun stuff, play a lot, and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask you're wearing but any mask in your collection.  That said, while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here, I cannot recommend the game.  First off, for gameplay reasons: in Overkill, probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork, the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots. If you're the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear, and the game gives you the tools to do that, there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy. What you'll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapid-fire as possible (unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun, in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable).  This means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category, you can easily narrow each category down to one or two 'best' guns, and the others are only there if you're comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using.  Then, of course, there are the business practices of Overkill. The game was profitable based on pre-orders alone, and while free content and map packs are added, so is a lot of cheap cash-in DLC that often includes pay-to-win mechanics: at first you needed DLC to have grenades, now you need DLC to have the powerful molotov cocktails, and a separate DLC for the useful ninja stars. Do you want the best gun possible? Then you need to buy the mod pack DLC.  Even content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game: John Wick was added to the game as a playable heister, supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in. Another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer.  Most recently as a 'reward' for completing challenges ahead of Crimefest, Payday 2 was given a crate/key system just like in CS:GO, where as a 'thanks' to the community now a portion of your post-heist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a 'drill' to open it, where it will then give you a random weapon skin that, just like with the DLC, makes your weapon stronger.  Is there fun to be had? Sure. But there are other games out there that are just as fun, but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets. Go play one of them instead.",-1,1

Today 30/05/16 Overkill pre-announced the update #100 for the game,basically they bought the game rights back from the publisher(505Games)and announced that the priced drills will be REMOVED for ALL the upcoming safes,this basically mean that the safes will keep dropping but that they will automatically be open for FREE,no more drills,you can still trade the skins but NO NEED to use drills to open the safes(all the 'old' safes will still require a drill to be opened but they will remove the drop for them).  Now this means they actually better now no more Overkill liars? kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkill  Here  [www.twitch.tv]  they said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...  Now that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)  So as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.   My review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.  EDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that 'force' them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or max 50% true,what is sure is that Overkill agreed with the introduction of MT's,maybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knows,people think that after several months after the Black market update aka skins and MT's introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for free,so basically there's still a lot of stuff from Overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better.  ['OLD' review will remain here as reminder of what happened]   As you can see from my hours on record,i'm a PayDay 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this game/devs since the start lovelly idea's and a Developer different from the other one's,i saw a lot of things change,some were cool and fantastic,some less but Overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they don't like and as always i was there enjoying the game,a Developer that actually listen to the user request/feedback is hard to find this days,that's one of the reason why Overkill WAS my favorite game Dev,some months ago they started releasing REALLY low quality and Buggy DLC at full price every month,the last one was the worst of all time(chyvarly DLC)and now at the time of this review,they introduced micro-transaction in the game,just to let you know they always said that they will NEVER introduce Micro-transaction in the game because they said they absolutly don't like that kind of things,and today they've done the exact opposite.   EDIT:21/10/2015 In the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushed/last moment card drop called the Wolf Card that give's you a drill for free,nice move Overkill nice move,but it's not what we asked,the Micro-transaction have to leave FOREVER,they never was something to add to this game as Almir said at the game launch 'We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)' this is someting that have to be removed,you lied to us Overkill,and that's what you got Tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world.  EDIT:25/10/15 Worst crimefest ever,a fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as 'rewards'.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Great game ruined because the devs are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. Weapon skins that give you better stats? CS:GO Syle crates? Overall its a decent game, but the devs have decided to screw over the community. They could have at LEAST not added stats to the skins. But nope, gotta get that money while ruining the game for the playerbase. GG guys, uninstalling.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"A once wonderful game, ruined by greed. We were promised no micro-transactions and we then, we got micro-transactions.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2," EDIT: While the game has been reclaimed by the original developers without extra additions, it currently feels as if it's a dead horse, being beaten with the skin and DLC stick.    This game is generally good, and has a plethora of user-created mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops. But enough of the rose colored filter and let's get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game.  1. The community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices. You'll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than you're new and/or learning the game, or haven't tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host, who is apparently some incarnation of a god. Joining a friend usually solves this problem.  2. Peer to Peer game hosting - You'll always be at the mercy of someone else if you don't host yourself, the game is liable to crashes, freezing, frequent desync issues, and random disconnects.  3. The game has an infurating amount of DLC, and your performance compared to the players who do have the DLC is almost insulting. An example of this being the Gage Sniper Pack. Make no mistake, with this game you will have to PAY.  4. A worrying trend with Overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied, and occasionally bundling it up as DLC. What was a boatload of hype with 'The Dentist' and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment, with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in 'The Golden Grin Casino Heist'.  5. When Overkill does make content that affects gameplay, it is usually overkill (No pun intended) on how it's balanced- creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you don't use said items or skill builds.  6. The nature of some of the DLC content has become Pay2Win, for instance - The Buzzer, a melee weapon from the latest Golden Grin Heist. Using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including Special Police Units. This trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties.  7. The game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style, however you'll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively.  8. Stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer, where a mis-step on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons. However, multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer. The desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as AI detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client (who is usually just moments behind the host).  What usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of DLC that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"This was the best game i've ever played. But why it's now garbage. The amount of DLC'S that have been produced, 26! What the f***, it costs more then the game itself! Even when it was $50 and the worst part is. $5 for a few masks, and some mostly terrible weapons that are just for looking cool. Sure, some are good, but still $5.00. I've had this game from the start, it was amazing despite all the bugs. But now it's basically become Clash Of Clans. I preordered this game, the least they could do is give us the seasons pass or a few free DLC'S for trusting their game. Also, $5.00 for a character. Seriously, now it's just $5.00 for a character soundtrack and skin. ALSO, the amount of hackers on this game is pathetic, seriously they need to stop it. Also, look at Payday: The Heist. It has 1 DLC. This has 26. Don't even get me started on $7.00 on a map, seriously it should be free, we paid for the game we should own the whole thing. The worst part is that there is other games (like Terraria) that have released sooooo many free updates without any dlc. And we get 'Old Hoxton' and 'John Wick' and we get 5 dissapointing maps.  Do not buy this game, i'd urge you to download Clash Of Clans instead of this.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I've been playing this game since its beta, back then, the game used to have a lot of potential, It was a game I was excited for back in 2013. When Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels. At this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.  I would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.  Of course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.  Back in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group.  Reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark. And then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye. Not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.  A couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.   Then we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the 'free' rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ 'support' with 4 masks and a weapon skin 'crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible'). I suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.  But this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough. Fast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward. And then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system à la CS:GO. 'But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?' Well, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.  Meanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.  I cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.  The game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2," TLDR: The game is full of advertisements and unkept promises.   The game was good, but not anymore. Overkill have shown great innovation in how to mess up a great game. I've played the game for nearly 1,000 hours, so I'm not someone just blindly hating, nor do I take any pleasure in giving, what used to be, my favourite game a negative review. -They fill it with advertisements, essentially turning it into a massive billboard and showing they have no care for the game itself, just the money it generates.   A John Wick playable character   Two Hotline Miami cross-promotions   A illogical heist based around a no name DJ with his face plastered throughout it and you are forced to listen to his music. The worst part? This  advertisement  costs $7USD   An Alienware promotion that was 2 masks and 1 melee which was built up for 3 days and the masks are only for people that own an Alienware Alpha, a $500 console   A Speedrunners crosspromotion requiring you to own Speedrunners which took up a day during an event which was supposed to be full of free content   A mask to advertise a VR which Starbreeze had invested money into   A 30 day countdown which ended on Payday 2's 1 year anniversary, which was filled with references to characters and locations in the game's universe, to advertise a new game they would be developing   A melee weapon from The Walking Dead  -They promise a lot of content, some which was paid for, some which was earned through community accomplishments and some which was supposed to be free, yet they don't release any of it and constantly delay it whilst they release a large amount of DLC in between.   Safehouse customisation was supposed to be a feature since the start of the game and was used as part of the game's advertisement, has still not been released almost 2 years later and shows no sign of it being released, they recently claimed they don't even know what it will be   An event which required the community to reach certain amount of members before October 2014 in order to unlock content has had much of it's content delayed including; FBI files, which have been delayed until at least 2016 and they have claimed to not know what it will be and a new enemy type, which is in the same situation as FBI files.   The Completely Overkill pack was a $20 pack which was available for only a month and limited to 50,000 copies. It contained 4 masks, a secret item to be released at a later date and was supposed to be for Overkill's biggest supporters and they claimed it was not supposed to be a donation at all, they even passive-aggressively commented upon those who didn't buy it. After the pack was no longer refundable, they then announced that the secret item would actually be 25, but purchasers would only be able to obtain 1 out of those 25 items. It's now 4 months later and Overkill have insisted on keeping their biggest supporters in the dark, the only information they have given about these 25 items is that it is a part of a larger project and has no ETA at all   The infamy update, which was released in January 2014, was released unfinished. They delayed the remainder of it for over a year, despite it being the most requested update by the community, while releasing SIXTEEN paid DLCs in between. The reason for it being delayed for so long is because they wanted to make it as awesome as possible, but evidently that was not what happened. The update consisted of 8 masks and that's all.   The Golden Grin Casino heist was promised to be released by the end of 2014, but they delayed it. It's now being released nearly 7 months later after being palmed off to another company, though at least since they sent it off to another company, it will have less of a chance of being a bad heist. Since the Casino was announced, they have released a large amount of other updates.   There were supposed to be balancing for the new Swat Van Enemy, this was promised 3 months ago and there has been absolutely no indication of there being any changes.

I might not have alot of hours put into the games, but it was a nice game to get back on once in a while and Crimefest was the perfect opportunity to get back in now.  After seeing the First Day Update of skins that BOOST stats of the weapons and the gambling mechanic, which costs as much as a key in TF2 or CS:GO, i deinstalled and im never going to look back.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Game used to be fun. Not anymore. Pointless grinding and the money-making policies of Overkill ruined it.  Aside from 200$ and more in DLC with overpowered weapons and weapon classes people with the vanilla version have no access to (e.g. RPG, any sniper rifle, any LMG, grenades), Overkill introduced a crate system similar to CS:GO, Dota 2 oder TF2.  This was 'rewarded' to the community for completing challenges set by Overkill for the annual Crimefest. Payday 2 is nothing but a money grab for the developers. They don't care about their players at all unless they critisize Overkill in which case they will be banned from the forums and their posts deleted.  This game is a rip-off similar to 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' and the like.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"The game was great, but instead of fixing important bugs and fulfilling their promises they decide to pump out more and more DLC for ridiculous prices. With two more years of DLC cash grab coming up I no longer have faith in this game. Yes, DLC is optional but the game without DLC is rather limited and not worth it's money. The insane amount of DLC also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns. You get kicked from games because you don't have the right DLC related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless you're willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required DLC. This sort of DLC policies ruin the gaming industry and based on all this I simply can't recommend the game.  And now they added microtransactions in what was supposed to be a period of free updates (crimefest). This only adds to my earlier frustration and only confirms my earlier message.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"So this is my review after 1856 hours of Payday 2; been a fan of the franchise since PDTH. Please keep in mind that i'm german and english is not my native language.  We've been let down and were lied to quite a lot by Overkill Software for the past few years, since the release of Payday 2.  Some of the bugs which have existed since release and the absolutely horrible netcode with all the desync have never been looked into despite the fact that they were mentioned and complained about quite a lot within the community forums.  Yes, i'm aware of the fact that desync is basically the way the engine handles lag but it's not normal to lag behind for 10 seconds or so while in any regular game you're probably having a ping of 300-400 ms connecting to anyone across the world. Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.  Another example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.  Guess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it 'once the dust settled' and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.  The release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC .  The optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine. We also had a DLC called 'The completely Overkill pack' which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released. The Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.  They used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).  There was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.  Safehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.  For the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the  PD2Stats  [www.pd2stats.com]  site to read the story about all of this yourself now.  The latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past. Proof:  Proof #1   Proof #2   Proof #3  [www.gamespot.com]  The community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself. They basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced. The Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own. A single drill costs 2,49€ right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99€) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24€). All of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for. They even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums.   Proof   Personally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20€ and comes with additional DLC worth about 110€ should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.  They disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to 'create' skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories.  My very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Time for a serious review after all the 3k playtime hours jokes *Last updated 17/11/15*   CONS:  -After crimefest 2015 Overkill has added microtransactions into the game and completely ruined the playerbase with Crates, Skins and a bunch of other crap. The game is now completely Pay2Win and none of the 'Free' fun is in it. And paid skins actually give you an advantage. yay. Not to mention 2 years ago they promised to never ever add microtransactions and then hoped people would forget a few years later and back stab them. shame on you overkill!  -Short repetitive maps with small objectives, most maps are just drilling, getting cash and going to the escape zone. Only a few maps are low with lots of objectives and loud action such as Hotline Miami, but those aren't a lot of maps. Most maps are just small with not many verities, most missions require you to camp at a small place and fight through waves of cops. compared to PAYDAY: The Heist where everything is open with lots of objectives and places to look through.  -A 2 years old game that hasn't been optimized since the release, the players have to trust and struggle with mods in order to get a playable FPS in game.  And of course the latest maps they released, received a crap ton of complains about low FPS because the maps are so huge and their game is so poorly optimized.  -The textures are so rubbish that modders have to make HD mods so you could enjoy something rather than 1024 textures of your character model or NPC's dropped weapons (etc) Sometimes i stand in a corner and see pixels on the floor trying to look like a pepsi can and other trash.  -AI is literally useless in this game, all they do is follow you and help you up. Nothing else, absolutely nothing. so Multiplayer co-op is the main focus of this game, offline isn't as enjoyable as online.  -Apparently DLC releases are more important than bug fixes The game has a sh  it ton of bugs that haven't been fixed since the release.  -If you want to actually enjoy the game and advance most your weapons to be Death Wish compatible you will need to purchase a few of the DLCs, or else its nearly impossible for a beginner. If you don't pay, you are simply underpowered. Thank god there's no PvP. Although its nice that paying for DLC isnt a must to play a certain map. (Seriously RPG, Nade launchers and Flame throwers are great)  -A community based off most players farming their infamy ranks on SR or HB and considering themselves pros and kicking everyone under the level Infamy 5 from their lobbies and considering themselves as Godlike heisters. No one actually cares about the heist plan, your role or the in game objectives. All they care is that medic or ammo bag you bring to the heist to supply them.  -Over 2 years old free promised content hasn't been released until this very day.  -Most lobbies are too mainstream that its simply hard to find something different these days, like a loud Bank Heist or a Heli escape on Big Bank (you get the point).  -Developers listen to the community yet they are too bi  tchy to invest in a Workshop or a proper freaking in game AntiCheat.  -Infamy ranks are not as satisfying as you might think, they're actually easy to grind and a sh  it that isn't rewarding.   PROS:  +Cheap DLCs (recently also got a price drop) +Monthly updates (DLC fun) +Not a lot but enough free content from time to time to keep the Helmets Flying +Mod support but they won't bother investing a workshop so we stop paying for sites to save mods +4 and maybe more years of in game content support (2 more years of dlc and free content) +A somewhat 'Okay' plot in the background of the PAYDAY gang and Hoxton's betrayal. +Wide variety of weapons, masks, modifications and so on. +A somewhat balanced skills and perks system yet still buggy at some points.   I wrote a lot larger review than this but steam didn't let me post this because i wrote too much. Anyways, i will clearly keep playing this game. i don't dislike it but i experienced and saw way too much in game to know that this game isn't something a new player would enjoy. I would personally uninstall and ask for a refund if i tried to join lobbies 10 times in a row and some infamy trashy decides to kick me instead of giving me tips or helping me out.  Also, this is not a DLC complain post, i own them all and will probably own future ones as well. No flame no hate, i love Almir and the other developers but you can't force the whole community to behave and stop being as co  cky as Hoxton is to Houston.  edit: Yes, know my English is absolute MINT.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"The developers milk the game like a cow now. In the update celebrating the anniversary of the game the developers added game skins, so the game can become another 'uncrating simulator', like TF2 (which is free, mind you) and CS:GO (Which doesn't have 28 DLC's that you have to pay for). I wouldn't mind it as much, if the skins were just cosmetic, but they aren't. That's right, SKINS give you an actual advantage, since they boost stats. Also some of the skins are just for DLC weapons, which will most likely lead to situations like this:  Overkill: 'Oh you just spent (a ton of money on keys, or as they call it 'drills') and actually managed to unlock a cool skin for the RPG, nice. Now, would you like to use that skin? What's that, you don't have the DLC for it?! Welp, better go spent another few bucks, since the skin is useless until you do!'   The things that the developers were supposed to add during the anniversary celebration were promised to be free, instead we got this. They tried to make us feel better afterwards by adding cool things such as heists from the first game, masks (a ton of them) and... a jumping animation, which to me serves the same purpose as applying lube AFTER getting rammed from behind.  I really worry about the future of this game, (or the gaming industry in general) if other companies will follow Overkill's example...",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I can't recommend this game. Despite the amount of hours I've put into it, I simply can't recommend a game that's slowly deteriorated to the point that it's more of a chore than a joy to play.  When I first got my paws on this game, it was back when there were only a couple of DLC packs, where 'infamy' wasn't a thing to prove your worth, and where players were actually more creative and dared to try new ways of completing heists rather than just repeating the structured meta that they believe they must abide by at all costs.   Now Overkill promise us 2 more years of 'supporting' the game, which in their language means to churn out more DLC weapon packs instead of new and inventive missions. Not that it makes the slightest of difference in the rare times that they do add extra content, as lobbies only ever consist of the same mission repeated over and over that gains them high exp (case/s in point; Hoxton Breakout and Shadow Raid).   So I start with my first major issue; the community is mostly full of pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. With a minor amount of exceptions, high infamy players think they're the ♥♥♥♥. If they're not trying to order around the lower/none infamy players, they're kicking them from matches instantly, practically defeating the whole objective of helping them to learn how to play.  Bare in mind, 'infamy' means nothing in this game, at least not how it used to (when infamy only hit 5). It doesn't prove how much experience you have at the game, it doesn't make you any stronger or makes you any wiser. It's just simply for those who are bored of sticking to level 100, and want to repeat it all over again to collect infamous masks and recieve exp faster. What's more ironic is that most of these high and mighty players have only gained their ranks through repeating the same mission over and over until they're given exp penalties and/or their brains turn to mush, which would explain a lot about their attitude. Either way, they have no room to mock others for learning missions when they're only accustomed to one or two missions themselves.  And I wouldn't make an issue out of this and call it a con to the game if it didn't happen as often as it does, but you will experience this... a lot. If you're new, just try to stick to players around your level if you want to avoid being patronised.  So unless you've got a handful of friends to play this with, most of your playtime here will be spent browsing for servers via  'Crime.net'  trying to find something other than the tedious Hoxton Breakout mission, only to join a server and either get kicked for some bizarre reason or lose connection to the host.  Furthermore, the game just seems to have lost of lot of its initial sense of cooperating as a team. If only for helping to take down enemies in the waves of loud missions, nobody really needs to work together with players anymore. Nobody is really assigned to a specific role, nobody really cares what your priorities ingame are, just so long as you bring them some extra ammo and health kits. It can literally be a one man job if the player has a good idea on what he's doing, especially when it comes to completing missions in stealth, which are usually better off alone due to desync issues and ridiculous random glitches that often occur.  In the times that you do actually get into a full party match with random players, nobody ever wants to think outside of the box. Everybody has a strict and structured way of playing each and every map, despite the fact that the game implements a 'random number generator' system to change your experience each time you play a heist.  Heck, if you dare to open the door to stairs in Hoxton Breakout, prepare to be called a noob for not using it on a shutter door or the damn armory. Or if you want to just play 'Bank Heist' in loud for once, the public won't be happy and normally quit immediately. This is down to the community and the game itself. Heists aren't as free and open as they'd fool you into believing. Sure, you can choose to play most missions loud or stealth, but once you make the decision between the two, then you stick to the same objectives. Nothing ever truly random happens, such as random last minute objectives or a change in plan. The closest thing you get to that is the pre-planning stage before a heist, in which you choose your escape plan and place a few packs of ammo to make your life easier. If you're lucky, your pickup helicopter might land on the other side of the map. Whoopie. They even allow you to draw in the pre-planning stage, which is just completely pointless, as nobody ever really plans their heists out. Most stealth heists just end up in a game of trial and error.  So the remaining issues I have with the game.  - It's been out long enough, yet the devs just haven't really given players enough options to optimise their game to their liking. Not a major issue, but still a pain that players have to use user made mods if they want to improve their performance.  - None of the missions are long enough, and/or are just repetitive and tedious. Most loud missions are just placing a drill and surviving waves of enemies until the drill is complete, and then throwing bags of money around. Stealth missions are pretty much the same, minus waiting around for drill but instead having to avoid the line of sight of guards that somehow have the ability to walk through walls when the game decides to have a glitchy moment.  - The card drop feature in order to gain masks and weapon attachments is just another reason the game is more of a chore. It's also the perfect excuse for Overkill to sell you their 'mod pack' DLC or other weapon DLC to speed up the process of finding those much needed attachments for your weapon/s.  - You're literally paying for achievements with some of the DLC. Yes, despite the fact that you've paid £3.99 for a pack, you will be unable to use all of its content until you've completed the required achievements.  - Unless you're buying DLC, most of the free weapons are underpowered in comparison, further forcing you to buy the DLC if you want the most from this game and to be on par with the other DLC paying players. Hell, anything that Overkill do give you for free is still underpowered or weak in content compared to the DLC.  - It would seem DLC is a priority over fixing game issues and errors. I mean sure they eventually get around to fixing those issues, along with the release of another DLC pack.  So in conclusion, I guess you might consider it unfair to judge a game mainly by its community. But it's thanks to the game itself that the community is set out how it is. The game relies on a good community, but fails to support it. The game is currently in a state leaving the players with nothing more to do than grind for exp or test out new DLC weapon packs. And it's the repetitive and tedious missions that leave you with these only options. And I mean 'repetitive'. There's literally 4 missions of the same 'Bank Heist' which is just the same mission with different items to throw in bags, yet these are considered 'unique' from each other.  In the beginning, the game really felt like something new and different. New ideas promised, (which have since been 'put on hold') and the players actually seemed to play for the fun rather than the rank beside their username. Now it just feels like the developers don't know where else to take the game. They won't give us a Steam workshop, yet will release new weapon packs often. They leave it to modders to create unstable LUA mod to help improve their game experience and fix issues the devs are fully aware of, rather than fix these issues themselves.  So up to this point, until they decide to actually improve the game, quit with the DLC priority and help the players have a better experience, I simply can't recommend it.  So here's to 2 more years of nothing but weapon pack DLC, and a whole lotta unfixed bugs.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"A review in the form of a heartfelt open letter to Overkill.  Dear Overkill Software,  You don't know me, nor do you care to know me. But you know my money, and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value. I bought your game back when it was in beta testing. You know, when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 1/3rd of the game? And that pre-orders would get all future content for free?  I cringed when you lied about us only playing 1/3rd of the game in beta. All you did was unlock our levels to level past 30. And gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already. Only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less.  I moaned when you started releasing DLC heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us. I even b*tched when you only gave us pre-order alpha and beta players a single $5 DLC for our investment into the game's future.  But the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing, It was everything. Your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends, of which there where a sizable few, to not touch your game in years. The last heist I did willingly for fun was Shadow Raid for point of fact. Back when it was freshly released not even a week old.  A friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your DLCs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current. We did the Hoxton break out as it was new, and again, I noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more, and pay you more money.   As it was, i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope. None of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team, and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time.  That is only one example of how you'd turned this game into DLC Quest. And what of your lies that pile upon this? We where promised things to do with our off shore money, and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization.  Nothing ever came in the time I played. Nothing of reason or value. And as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game, but I could be wrong. The point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even -AT- release in the case of safe house customization. But they where blatant lies designed to get our money.  I may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this, but the message will be clear regardless. After spending nearly 100$ in this game, I still don't have all of the DLCs, nor do I want them at the rate you're going.  You're not getting a penny more from me, nor my friends who use to enjoy this game. And that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory, even competing with Skyrim, and trumping Overwatch for the shear fun.   But if I have to keep paying for your DLCs to stay in current content. If I have to do asinine, borderline moronic, achievements for critical items. If I have to be force fed lie after lie, I do not want to play your game. Nor will I play the next.   When Payday 3 comes out. There had best not be any DLC for the first 6 months. You owe us that much. The first 6 months should be free content as you'd promised us we'd get this time but lied to us about. I and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any DLC in the first 6 months.  Money talks. You built a game a bout stealing it, and in the process stole mine. It's time to put your theft where it should be, in the game not in reality.  Yours truly, A very disappointed, and spurned fan.  PS: Even having spent at or arround $120 on this game, and owning over half the DLCs it would still take another $90 to buy all the current DLC I dont own. Buyer beware, they will nickle and dime you to death.  PPS: I'd like to iterate that payed DLC is not a bad thing. It’s the content and quality Vs price margien i'm upset with, a well as frequency of paid Vs free DLC. The main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting. Had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many DLC, I'd likely have bought more DLC and played longer as a genuine truth. Had all Missions been Free and guins been the only DLC, i'd likely have been able to pick and choose what i want, or need in the case of meta weapons, easier. Or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed DLC i'd likely have been less happy with that than any other option but it’s still preferred to what you’re doing now.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"When PayDay 2 was released it was so much fun to play, there was no other game like it and had a really good developement team who would update it a lot and for free and this now annoys me to rate it negative because I used to play this game a lot and enjoy every second of it. but after about 6 months the game just kept getting worse and worse as the developers started trying to milk money from this game by adding tons of pointless DLC which barely contain anything and are priced at £3.99 each which is a lot considering that you basically get 4 masks, 4 new melee weapons (which are basically pointless), a few paintjobs and a new gun, the game is also extremely repetitive after a while, most of the maps are pretty small if they are Non-DLC and have a boring set up as they basically just move a keycard or close a door whenever you play it again, there are a lot of weapons in this game which is really good as there is a huge variety and a good weapon modding system but this gets quite annoying as the mod you want for a gun is so hard to get as you can only get one drop from a heist and most of the time it's just an annoying paint for a mask which you don't want. the last time I played this game a lot of hackers were in it and they just ruined the game because they were either there to troll you and ruin your stealth or spam the map with loads of money bags which just crash your game, another annoying thing is when your trying to stealth and some troll joins your game throws a grenade or shoots and alerts you and leaves straight away, I know you can avoid this by having private heists but most of the time your going to want to play with other people as it's easier and more fun.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Overkill are untrustworthy. Several representatives of Overkill claimed that Payday 2 would not include micro-transactions. One such represenative said that it would 'never' happen. And yet, they implemented micro-transactions as part of the 'free' Crimefest II update. Moral of story: Never buy Overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless.  Furthermore, independent sources claim that Overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update, even mods 'approved' by Overkill such as HoxHud, by supposedly removing the LUA Hook required to make mods work. If true, such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time.  Finally, that Overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a 'reward' for completing community challenges in the Road To Crime Fest Event shows complete and utter contempt for the Payday 2 community. Keeping in mind that the Road to Crime Fest Event is all about celebrating the anniversary of Payday: The Heist - which is ironically micro-transaction free. Clearly Overkill have grown fat on the profits of their hit DLC train known as Payday 2, I say that because every employee at Overkill must be on acid for them to collectively conclude that this was the right way and right time to implement something that they'd previously stated they'd never do.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I tried, Overkill, I really did. You didn't fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new DLC, and new enemies that were unfair WITHOUT DLC, and I tried to ignore it. I loved this game, I really did, and I played it to virtually no end, even at one point abandoning Team Fortress 2 for it. 'Weapon packs' that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in, with nothing useful to add, just one gimmick weapon to grab people's attention in the hopes that they'd buy the 'Wacky' item, and I tried to ignore it. I got over the fact you never bothered programming Cloakers properly, and that they're happy to kick you from the ground floor on Rats whilst you're on the roof if they can't think of a way to path to you. Desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial 'Patch' that vaguely improved it whilst drop-in joining, even though a community mod (PocoHUD) addresses the issue perfectly well, and I got over it. Refusal to add limb hitboxes because they'd be 'Too much unnecessary work' when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it, but I STILL got over it. Your treatment of loyal fans on Twitter, e.g. the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of 'IF I LOVED A GAME ID BUY IT ON PC' (As though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment) I resented, but I played on regardless. The Hype Train, a pay-to-enter version of a previous free event, that provided us with an advertisement for a future pay-for DLC and an enemy that's virtually immortal without DLC, that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way I tried and tried to ignore, but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin. When you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented TWO YEARS AGO and didn't start development for until the beginning of 2015, and instead just made it a hyper-powerful version of an already existing enemy (That of course is weak as a kitten if you use DLC-only explosives), that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself I was disgusted. The FBI files, a long-awaited addition to the game, turned out to be a link to Overkill's own website that plays a cute little 'Virtual machine' that shows you gun statistics, something there's already a Wiki for, as well as the character's profiles and backgrounds, something you could already see on crimenet in game. And I took a break, and figured I'd get over it eventually. I'd come back, I'd play again. I played this game to the point where I could beat Death Wish solo on loud heists, so surely I'd pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms. Right? And then Overkill lost it. The game now has CS:GO's uncrating system. They clearly noticed Gun Mettle was a huge success in Team Fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing. Small problem with this theory, however: Team Fortress 2 already had an item system, and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be. Payday had nothing of this sort, so this comes across as a blatant cash-in on an idea that worked for another game. But that's fine. Even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the I (Or the inspect animations in this instance), it worked for CS:GO, it wasn't as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in TF2, maybe it'll work for Overkill, despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons. And if that were it, I'd say 'I really hate this company but whatever' and resign myself to just playing. But no, that's not all. The weapon skins give statistical advantages. These give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins. And there's NO other way to get them, save for opening them with a  key drill, straight from the community marketplace. You HAVE to spend money, REAL money, not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation, but actual currency on your Steam account, to get these weapons, and by not shelling out extra money that already costs (Or so I've been informed, not a US resident) around 25$, you are at a disadvantage to other players who WILL do so, because Overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update TF2 did for free, which was successful because of the rebalancings. Congrats, Overkill. I know I'm not the only person you'll have heard this from, but you're true filth, and I took great pleasure in uninstalling. DON'T buy this game. All you'll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an ever-expanding list of DLC, and now apparently some pretty gun skins, or else the game is insultingly difficult (On Death Wish, all other difficulties are easy regardless, because why would 'Overkill', the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it, pose a challenge, and stealth is always easy just for what it is). The game is disgusting, and never content with the amount of cash it's sucked in, and broken beyond repair. But don't expect it to be fixed. That'll cost you extra. Brief update, significantly late: The microtransactions have been (Mostly) retracted. Whether that's enough to make amends isn't for me to decide, feel free to decide for yourself",-1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"If you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star, or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives, then this may be the game for you. Failure is the only option.  Most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet-to-planet maneuver, or how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer. No, it'll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived, but somehow did. My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface. He bounced! And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way. He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong--the only type of mission that truly exists. He fell from space! And lived! Forget space, erect a statue!  My first manned mission to the Mun ended in predictable failure. I tried landing without any sort of landing gear. How, you might ask? By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff. I forgot about my horizontal velocity, however, and ended up ripping the engine apart. I had all the fuel I needed for a return mission, but the broken engine was left kilometers away. Oops. At least I could plant a cool flag.  I attempted a rescue mission, because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do: stranded person in space? Send more people to help them! The first mission collided with the Mun at 600 m/s. Rough landing. The second mission landed, but I was probably 50km away--which isn't all that bad, all things considered. I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed ship, but it was taking forever. So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things. Lemons and lemonade. As it turns out, you can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid, like the surface of the Mun. You will forever be in our thoughts, Mac Kerman.  So much for the rescue. I may as well have the rescue team return safely. Remember that landing gear part? Yeah, I still hadn't updated that section of the ship. Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp. Bulletproof logic. At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fiery, fiery death. An honorable death. By my own hands.  In KSP, your little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous 'Lost' column. It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kerman's name in there. I didn't care so much about the other guys. Who cares about the second guy on the Mun? But here's the thing, several years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action! He came back from the dead! And what was the first thing he wanted to do? Go back into space! To die again!  In conclusion, yes to this game. Just yes. I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moon, Minmus. Yes, he is in a stable orbit without a ship. Just him. And he's been there for close to 30 years now. I'll get around to that at some point.  Update: Still in orbit.",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I score this Simulation game 12/10, just hit the buy button! It exceeds all expectations. The game isn't finished yet, but I don't care. They can't fail anything anymore. Just buy it. Or wait for a sale and then buy it. Whenever you buy it, you won't feel ripped off! I guarantee you that!   Kerbal Space Program is pure MAGIC! On the facade it comes across as something with the depth of Angry Birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled. However, there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions! There's a reason I'm scoring this game 12 out of 10. I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library. I even try NOT to play it, but when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores...  KSP, like the name might have hinted, is a Space Program Simulator Game. There is the career mode, involving missions and research, and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it. The game is in early access and the career needs work (I find the missions redundant and confusing, but it's already fun), and this review is more about the sandbox mode.  You run the show, so you set out your own missions, like fly to the moon or another planet. Then you have to build your lander, rover, satelite or whatever, the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space! Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space, you also need to learn to make an orbit. Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around. There are no concessions! By the time you've figured out how to get where you want to go, you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight! You don't need a science degree to do this and to understand this, the game is brilliant this way. You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too.  I recommend this game to all people that like simulation games, tycoon games, Lego (the plastic bricks), science fiction in general, science in general, rockets and blowing stuff up, real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn.  As you set out your own missions, you send your Kerbal individuals (they all have names) on grand adventures. Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons. The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse (really a fun and beautifull feature). In the Kerbol (name of the star) system you will also find the planets Moho, Eve with it's moon Gilly, Kerbin with Mun and Minmus, Duna with Ike, then a gas-giant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo. The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space. It may be a scaled down planetary system, but that doesn't mean it's small. I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world. Each planet and moon comes with it's own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you'll busy for hundreds of hours before you've done it all. Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother, you know what the other player is talking about.  When I started playing, I had little expectations. It looked like a mod, but then I reached space. It was like the opening of the movie 2001: a Space Oddisey. The 'space whales' ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin, ever going higher and higher, kerbin getting smaller and smaller, I passed the Mun... lost kerbin, then found the 'eva' button.. I found out stands for 'Extra Vehicular Activity', or 'Go play outside'.. so I lost my Kerbal. Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSP, while drooling over my keyboard.  This game is not done yet. I'm not sure when they aim for a release candidate, but they can't fail this anymore. Nasa has made an addon for it, so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed. Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new Space-X rocket, how awesome is that! And the developer has even announced multiplayer!!! I don't know how this will work and what we could do in an online game, and It's already more fun if a friend plays this game too, but it's anticipated by me nonetheless.   The educational value of this game is through the roof! I thought I understood the principle of orbits, but boy did I learn a lot. I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically, but putting it to practice requires more then just going. So, I watched Nasa do it. They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed, so ok... I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try-outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with. At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of 'every action has a 'pose and equal reaction' gets a whole new meaning in orbit (you'll see :KSmiley:).   Every run you make in Kerbal, you get more advanced. Your rockets become more stable, because you know how to make them, you get to other planets faster, because you know how to get there. My rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander, of which I built a new version every night, to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Duna, which took me 2 weeks to build! It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind-boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc (or the game's engine) found hard to process when launched.  There comes a point where you get stuck on something, like how to dock in space. There are several things to do, but I warn you: this can make or break your experience. Try as hard as you can if you're stuck, play with a friend (you know, together on one pc thinking and building) and if all else fails, then try youtube or a guide. Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience. But when you've reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes. I think every KSP player has posted screenshots, videos, guides both online and private to friends. The ammount of material you can dig up is staggering.  Also, don't install mods as you just start playing, exept for scan-sat perhaps (but don't, the other mods will lure you). Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy. I've reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame. I've reached the point of not getting my ships docked. This was the point where I looked on youtube, read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods, mods like MechJeb (in flight telemetry and autopilot options, use at your own risk), advanced cockpits (cockpit screens, buttons to press, external cameras, awesome!), more parts, graphical addons, scan-sat (scans planets, awesome!), etc. But with all games in early access, mods can be broken when the game is patched. But when you've reached that point, KSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities, as realistic as you want it to be.  This game is 100% quality, dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get. When it's done, it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game. With more standard parts, more physics, more career, more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now. From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I don't think this game will die out soon. Just buy the game, you'll have fun for years to come I promiss!!!  Now years after release, I stand by my review. This game will stand it's ground.

But today, when my son asked me that question (awww yis!), I simply said -- 'I'll show you how', and we fired up the game. I was able, with the help of KSP, to show my son the beauty of trial and error, the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is, and how small we are. I let him built it himself, parachutes on a moon lander, backwards engines and everything. I remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded, the look of awe as we made orbit, his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon. I remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes. Which didn't work. We crashed. Hard.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"When you play Kerbal Space Program, you find yourself becoming one of two types of individuals. Either you throw everything together and make things up as you go, or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it. Either way, mission success (whatever you define that to be) is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky (pun intended). It's very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your Kerbals (the characters that man spacecraft) has walked on the surface of another celestial body. It's also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when you've made it halfway across the Kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home.  This game will frustrate and exhilarate you. Well worth the purchase.",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"It's been quite a ride. Four long years of development, cool stuff, accidentally education, and the Kraken... and here we are. One point oh (point whatever!) And  oh,  are things different! But that's all the  past!  Let's talk about the present.  This is a game in which you go to space repeatedly, success optional.  Most of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination. You can just throw some bits together, hit the go button and see what happens! What's that? There are Kerbals in there? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device. Conversely, you can put things together in  a very particular manner  and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle. It's all up to you. Your sandbox is the solar system. Go play. Due to the nature of things and such, this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment, yet it's just as fun alone at home.  Now, for the less sandbox-oriented among us (or just the people like me who enjoy progression,) there's a  career mode!  This time, you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range, manned, ballistic missiles!  FOR SCIENCE!  Seriously, you generate  Science!  from everything, and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more  Science!  Be careful though. Don't want to blow up too many bits, because you have funding to worry about now. You should also take care of your Kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable.  Also the camera shakes, there's complicated aerodynamics, there's thermodynamics, there's moresodynamics, there's orbital mechanics, there's resource mining (which you can MAKE FUEL with,) there's management, there's pretty explosions, there's good sound effects that are also deafening, there's accidentally education, and so much more for only  some money!   However, the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating. Ignore it, fumble around for a while, and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era.  There's not really much else to talk about...

April 2015:   2000 hours and climbing, still have not run out of uniqe things to do.. theres always a crazier mission than you considered before... the mods have only gotten better, and with some tricks like running in OpenGL mode you can load this game up with ALOT of mods before it explodes. you can install Real solar system mod and play on a real life sized system, makes going to the moon and back something worth bragging about. thats for extremely advanced players as even i find it hard.  Feb 2016 - 3000 hours  Game completed, runs great on 64 bit version, now mods arent an issue and you can load it up until the cows come home. so much more stable than ever, faster than ever and every thing.

Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther.   Science: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money.   Sandbox: Like all Sandboxes.. Everything is tehre from the start, no money, science or anything else, Just build and have fun.   -------------------------------  What you do in the game is open ended. IT's your choice. Build what you want, and fly it anywhere you want (Or anywhere it can go). There are many many entire different planets to explore, moons, asteroids, etc. A fully open ended solar system.   Taking off from Kerbin, flying through the upper atmosphere, and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Truly Epic. One of those games I keep going back to (300+ hours as I write this).  Being a simulation, the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless.  My most recent Kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe (JoolStar1) was about to arrive at Jool after nearly 4 years in flight. Actually, it happened quite a while before that, I just wasn't aware of it.  I switched to the probe, ready to fine-tune my approach so I could cut through the atmosphere, bleeding off speed without wasting fuel.  Something was wrong. The probe didn't respond to inputs. That's when I realised I hadn't deployed the solar panels before leaving Kerbin orbit!   Cursing, I tried to deploy them. Nothing. I mashed the button repeatedly. Still nothing. I checked the batteries... Empty!  Since I didn't have a kerbal on board to do an EVA, there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly as JoolStar1 sailed straight past its destination, a failure destined to orbit the sun forever.  This game is all about failing repeatedly (and hilariously) until a Darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build, fly and land rockets.  I can't recommend it highly enough",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"2 things  1. The best game I have ever played.  2. SCOTT MANLEY.  I could write a 10k word essay on all the good things about this game. But I'll stick to pointing out the one thing that was both what got me hooked and would also frustrate me to the point of almost not wanting to play. The learning curve. It's the single most challenging learning experience I've had since I left uni! But I LOVED every second of it.   The absolute highlight of this game for me? When a friend and I shared a save file and flew a mission (over 2000tons of spaceship) to the planet jool with the aim of landing and every moon and then coming home. We worked on the designs together, assembled our ship in orbit together and ran the mission.   Kerbal has given me the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life... and I play a LOT of games!",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"While it's not exactly beginner-friendly, Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a brilliant game for what it achieves. What other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics, staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel? Gravity is a difficult beast to tame!  You're drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks, attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically. Once you're on the launchpad though, ♥♥♥♥ gets real. You will fail a lot, with your rocket exploding, or tipping over, or messing up the sequence of stages.  Just leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge, and that is still the early game! Sending probes and landers to other planets and moons, building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system; these are all possible. Beyond that, the Career and Science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments, and further still the Sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals.  Unless you're a genius or have a huge deal of patience you  will  need to refer to various tutorials, wikis, guides and discussions online. If physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks. You'll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game.  KSP will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th Century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time. Any person who's dreamed of working at NASA must try Kerbal Space Program.  Recommended!",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"It's not exactly rocket science is it?....oh wait, yes it is!  Kerbal Space Program is a game about building spacecraft and, unless you're very good at the game, watching them blow up which is currently in Early Access. In KSP you design and build your very own spacecraft/rockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave Kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal. With a vast array of parts at your disposable it's daunting at first, well it's daunting for a while, but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast, especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering.  KSP has four different game modes each of which I will give a brief description of.   First off there's sandbox mode. In sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away, this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works.  Next we have scientific mode. In scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places, e.g. the surface of Kerbin or low Kerbin orbit. Science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments. You begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress.  Up next is career mode. Career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about. Money is earned by completing contracts, such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane. Reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts, the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are. However, reputation can be lost through either failing contracts or losing kerbals.  Last, and probably least depending on what you like, are the game's pre-made scenarios. Ranging from tutorials on docking to the NASA redirect mission this game mode is what you would expect it to be, just different scenarios to try out, not much to say about this one.  +Graphics are pretty nice +Lots of different parts +The building menus are good and building is relatively easy, by easy I mean straightforward to use not easy to make decent vehicles +A number of different planets and moons, each with different appearances and properties +Good controls and useful hotkeys +Good staging setup +Endless possibilities of what you can make, from simple little rockets to huge spacestations in orbit around distant planets +Reasonaly good physics but not perfect (I'll get to that later) +Plentiful explosions +Huge replayability +Great modding community and adding mods is extremely easy +Kerbals are nice little race and you can get attached to the more well known kerbals quite easily (I &lt;3 Jeb)  +/-Very basic tutorials, this game really throws you in at the deep end  -Immensely steep learning curve, I'm 60+ hours in and I've only recently made it to the Mun (and successfully landed)  -The physics and controls for spaceplanes are pretty bad, spaceplanes have clearly been neglected in favour of rockets  Verdict: 9  An outstandingly good vehicle builder/sandbox game which is perfect for anyone with an interest in space, the related physcis or anyone who likes building vehicles.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Kerbal Space Program, at least to me is the king of simulation games. While I play numerous others (such as Farming Simulator) they don’t seem to hit every mark in that field. KSP, while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player, and force them to deal with it. While a game like Farming Sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops, KSP requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity, to a satellite connection back home.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"This game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game i've ever played, but it has also given me the greatest feeling of achievement from any game i've ever played.  When you land on the Mun for the first time, after mashing buttons trying to stabalise your craft and you barely make it due to the lack of fuel, there's no better feeling than knowing you have to do it all again and launch a rescue mission. (or you could just leave Bob there for science).....  I am a big fan of space, physics and science in general and playing this game has been an education for me. Because of KSP I have watched dozens of YouTube videos on astrophysics and aerodynamics I would have probably never watched without this game and learned a ton of interesting things, and i love that.  The game has a fantastic modding community with a huge variety of mods to add realism or give your game a futuristic sci-fi feel. A favourite mod of mine is 'Remote tech', I don't play without it.   This game produces some stunning visuals too as you drift through the vast openness of space, orbiting moons, chasing asteroids, collecting science and designing planes, rockets, trucks, rovers, probes, boats even helecopters and mech walker/transformer type sh** thanks to mods...

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"So i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review. Well, here i am.   So i got this game around summmer 2015, after wanting it for a long time. The game had just left early access and was in beta. (I just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game) I adore this game. Most of my summer was spent playing this. (Before you say that isn't possible, i would like to point out my hours didn't add up as I ran the game from the .exe rather than steam.)   I would, and have, recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success, science, exploration, engineering, space, cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of each-other and use them as landing gear.  The only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve. I know the 1.1 update added loads of tutorials, 'cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad, but you will spend around 5 - 10 hours before you can do anything useful. Needless to say though it is worth it, and soon you will conquer the solar system!  Or, y'know, just abuse the various bugs the game has... that's cool....  Anyway, thanks for reading this review.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"To begin, I guess I should give a short description: Essentially, KSP is a fairly realistic simulation game where you take control of and guide the nascent space program of a race of small green men and women from a planet named Kerbin. You will build your own vessels, choose your targets for exploration, colonization, scientific endeavor, etc, and blast off for space. The construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use, and, because of the level of customization available, tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike. There are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships (several mods change this if you want), but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate, and make for a, while unforgiving, very fun game, because the feedback is extremely consistent. A mistake will kill you EVERY time, unless something hilarious happens (this is actually one of the great parts of playing KSP).   I cannot say enough positive things about this game. I purchased this originally in April of 2013, before it was on steam, and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released. KSP has few goals, and in sandbox mode, it has none, but goals are not the reason to play KSP. The first time I successfully put a Kerbal in orbit around his home planet, I was dancing around my dorm room, and the first time I landed a Kerbal on the Mun, I felt a sense of accomplishment I have quite literally never felt in a game before. Now, over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play, I have built massive colonies on Laythe, the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, and even Ike, I've built huge orbital stations around various planets, and I've even built floating cities in the clouds of Jool and Eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available. I've built resource collection and transport systems including storage, mining, and transport operations. I've explored hundreds of different areas with probes, landers, and vehicles, and yet, to this day, I still play this game at least two to three hours a week, and I'll go on KSP binges several hours long when I think of a new challenge to set for myself. Currently, a friend of mine and I are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic Duna colonization project. If you can't tell by now, if you want an 'on rails' game where everything is spoonfed to you, just leave now. This game is most certainly NOT for you. The contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration.  But if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have, and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake, then KSP is your game. And when you finally put a Kerbal safely on the Mun, you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about KSP.",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"This is one of my favourite games. Its simply amazing.  KSP is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game.  Its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning, expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own. (Watch ScottManley tutorials if you want a head start)  I had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet (or keeping my rocket upright on the way there) - but now I am planing missions to other planets, landing and returning - sending unmanned rovers to explore - or even bringing asteroids back home.  800 hours in and I feel like I am still just at the beginning.  »Mün or bust« - unknown (prob.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Kerbal Space Program version 1.0.2. I've been playing the early access game for over 2 years, but now that it became official I thought I'd write a review. My review is very positive. (But see the caveat about version 1.0 below at the bottom).  (Full disclosure: I don't work for SQUAD but I do help write one of the mods for the game, so I am personally invested in this.)  Get This Game. For once a sci-fi game that is actual sci-fi and not science fantasy. It doesn't insult the intelligence of the player, and it speculates what-if, in a relatively reasonable way, only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay, rather than breaking ALL of them constantly like most space video games do.   Kerbal Space Program as history : Although the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible (so it doesn't take as long to get things done as it really would), it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical real-world space programs. Don't be fooled by the cute derpy-looking Kerbals - you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions - space stations in low orbit, docking maneuvers, performing an Apollo-style 'Mun' landing, send rover probes to 'Duna' (which is Mars-like), and so on. All from gluing together parts and having fun.  (And if you really want to go all-out, there are user community mods out there that replace the game's solar system with the real thing, so you can really try these missions out in full size).   Kerbal Space Program as a 'tycoon' style game :  If you like the old style 'tycoon' games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects, then Kerbal Space Program Career Mode is for you. Start up a new game, pick 'career mode', set Normal or Easy difficulty (do NOT use Hard until you've played a while), and you'll have the fun of trying to balance funding (for making better space center buildings, and for making the rockets themselves), reputation (for making future offers you see be better for you), and science points (for buying your way up the tech tree). Accept contracts, and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do. Don't fail them or else you'll lose funds and rep for it.   Kerbal Space Program as a mod platform :  From it's early access days, a user community of modders has grown, such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game. As of this writing, because KSP 1.0.2 is relatively new, some of those mods won't work just yet, but they will after only a week or two. If past use is anything to go by that's about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release. As Steam is not the only means of obtaining the game, and not even the first means of obtaining it, the company, SQUAD, has chosen not to support Steam Workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make Steam-only mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on Steam. I support this decision, but it does mean you'll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them. Look up 'KSP' on  {LINK REMOVED}  curse.com  and look for  Kerbalstuff.com.  most mods are in both places.   Kerbal Space Program as 'edutainment' :  The game is quite educational, but in that good sneaky fun way, where you don't realize you're learning - you're just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way. If you've got a teenager or pre-teen at home, give this to them. It does something that is really hard to do - it *demonstrates* though gameplay how a mathematical concept works, visually, without revealing the actual formulas, in such a way that the hard math can come *after* the intuitive understanding. Usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and 'feel' can't happen until *after* you understand the numbers. But here, it lets you play with the phenomenon first, and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you, rather than the other way around.  Get. This. Game.   A caveat:   My review refers to the 1.0.2 version of KSP and emphatically NOT to the 1.0 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical re-entry bug. Had I written the review about the 1.0 version, it would not have been as kind. The 1.0 release was rushed by about a week. The 1.0.2 release from a week later was MUCH better, and is probably what should have been the 1.0 release.  R.E. The KSP 1.0 re-entry bug: You may read reviews by people complaining about re-entry being broken when 1.0 game out. Those reviews weren't wrong *at the time* they were written. KSP 1.0 was rushed out with a re-entry bug that was very unfair, and importantly, really obvious so it's hard to imagine how they missed it. Adding a heat shield actually *caused* the ship to blow up on re-entry because adding it made the vessel flip nose-first, rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part. If you see reviews complaining about this behavior, be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version.  ",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I've only had this game for a month and I've already logged over 50 hours into it. Kerbal Space Program is NOT simply a game about building rockets, launching them, and seeing where they go. Its tagline is 'Conquering Space Was Never This Easy', and that is true, it is easy, compared to doing it in real life. But don't let it fool you- KSP actually has a pretty steep learning curve. In the month that I've had this game, I've only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of Kerbin (KSP's version of Earth). I haven't even gotten to a single moon or other planet. But don't let that deter you. Look up tutorials for the game (Side note- The in-game tutorials are actually pretty terrible. I recommend finding ones online, such as Scott Manley's, who does a great job of explaining how the game works).

In KSP, you ♥♥♥♥ up. The fun part is thinking of ridiculous plans to un-♥♥♥♥ up.",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it. I've played KSP off an on for a few years. The game has a very active mod-making fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play. My best review of this game is anecdotal. (I sent this to a friend when I was only a few hours into play. I had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics. Anyone who plays KSP might find this story relatable.)  'One of my test flights put 3 Kerbals into orbit. They were low on fuel so I did a retrograde burn to bring them home. Except that I didn't do a retrograde burn, I did a prograde burn. By the time I realized it, I had burned too much fuel to get them home. I reduced their orbit as much as possible, even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters. They were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point. With no way to return to the surface under their own power, I had one option; a rescue mission.  I built a new ship, one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which I dubbed 'Lost Eagle.' Lost Eagle had been fitted with docking collar and I guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort. The rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue. The final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for it's relatively low weight. This would end up being the ultimate design flaw. It was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members, and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before re-entry.   Docking is hard. I would say impossible but I've seen videos of people doing it and I know it can be done. But despite many hours and multiple misses. I had got Rescue 1 and Lost Eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away. I closed enough distance that I felt it would be close enough to 'jump.'  The first crew member from Lost Eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one. It went pretty smoothly, but in the process the ships drifted further apart. I did a corrective burn on Rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member. Success again. 1 left. He jumped, this time from the furthest gap. He too arrived successfully. I felt a rush of success, a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in today's video games. Plenty of fuel for the retro burn. They were coming home. This process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while.  The design of the re-entry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip. She wasn't pretty, but she was light and efficient. The plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere, but I had discovered that I couldn't deploy the parachutes from the re-entry craft. It was a problem I had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but I was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit. The whole thing still landed successfully in my tests.  At 5000m above the surface, having survived re-entry. I pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes. I don't know if I double tapped it or if I had just had my staging backwards, but when I hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can. Knowing full well that there was nothing I could do to save the pilot of Rescue 1 I watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival. I quickly switched to the other part of the ship. I tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them. The hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs. No controls that could be used to deploy the chutes. Again I watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom, the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second.   The game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission, or even the assembly area where I could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals. I chose not to. I was angry at myself for the mistake. I had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what I knew was a flawed design. The empty ship, Lost Eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any Kerbal that looks up, that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results. I will be reminded of this every time I play the game.'  ",1,1

Note my play time does NOT include the 50-100 hours I put in before the game was ever on Steam.  Simply one of the best products in the last decade, KSP is not your typical 'game'. It's a software toy. You tinker. You experiment. You adjust. You tweak. And you have a grand time doing it. KSP is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a super-deluxe space rocket that can go to the Mun or Eve with ease. If it did that KSP would not be any fun. Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam.   Instead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions. You'll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit. You'll pump your fist when you land on the Mun for the first time. And you'll continue having fun.  What are you waiting for? Go buy it!",1,1

You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.   It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension.

105600,Terraria,"To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.  Terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.  Building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.  The game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.  Plus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.  Watch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.",1,1
105600,Terraria,The fact that people call this a copy of Minecraft astounds me.,1,1
105600,Terraria,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"When I first saw my friend playing Terraria, I thought it was a 2d MineCraft. Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft.

105600,Terraria,The best casual sandbox game out there. Other popular games just fail to stand up to what Terraria has become,1,1
105600,Terraria,"  This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.  The essence of  Terraria  is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.   Pros      Customization : There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.     Exploration : The  Terraria  world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see 'The Creation of the Guide' painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the  Terraria  world, you discover something surprising.     Creativity :  Terraria  is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors.  Terraria  features innovative design at its finest.     Progression options : Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.  You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently  had too many options  and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.     Balance : A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into.  Terraria  manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.     Diversity :  Terraria  promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.  I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.     Automation :  Terraria  would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.     Performance : Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements.  Terraria  is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough* Starbound *cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy  Terraria  in its full glory.     Quality of life : Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is  Terraria 's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.     Continued updates : It would be very easy for  Terraria , as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.    Cons      New player friendliness : The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in  Terraria 's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.     Grinding : While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet  Terraria  is not above this issue.     Moddability :  Terraria  is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.  ",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the 'crafting' genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).   The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).",1,0
105600,Terraria,"Before you read this is NOT LIKE MINECRAFT! These are the only similarities: -They both have mining and exploration -They both have zombies to fight -They both have bosses -They both have Hell (an underworld)  That's all i can think of at the top of my head. Now, let me tell you about Terraria's advantages: -It has 13 (I think) bosses, unlike Minecraft only has 3 (I think) -It has TONS and TONS of enemies -It has over 3,000 items and weopons -It has Heaven and Hell -It's caves are more fun to explore and easier to find  Now, Terraria isn't all good, in some peoples eyes, in someways like: -It's 2D (I don't find it a problem) -It's too 'confusing' or 'boring' (again, I don't find it confusing nor boring) -It's a 'copy of Minecraft' (no it isn't btw) So, I hope you like my review and I encouraged you to buy it. *Add me if you need a partner for co-op gameplay* (NEW CHARACTERS)  EDIT by arachnid14 1. terraria has over 3900 items 2. they both have some form of electricity/circuit building 3. both are blocks (duh) 4. terraria is cheaper to buy and goes on sale occasionally 5. 2D is good since minecraft is already doing 3D and it would be kinda boring for the games to look so much alike 6.terraria has like 12 pets 7. minecraft has a useful pet 8. terraria makes light come from you when your holding a torch",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo, rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been. The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite.   While the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode. This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update. The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion.   Another issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage in and so on in standard RPG fashion.   While the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends. I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10",1,1

105600,Terraria,"Before you read, Terraria is NOT a copy of Minecraft.  In my opinion, Minecraft is a fun and really good game for building, but I stopped playing it of boredom a couple months after getting it. I did not play it every day. Now, Terraria is good for Building, Exploring, Fighting, Destroying, and is rewarding. Minecraft is very unforgiving; When you die you lose all your stuff and you usually can't get it back in time. In Terraria you can choose to only drop your money (It's easy to get it back.), you can choose to lose some of your items, or you can make your character die forever so you need to make a new one. I have been playing Terraria for +150 hours and I am still not bored of it the slightest bit. Also, if you still think it is a 'Stupid Rip-off of Minecraft' I am fine with that, BUT notice Terraria has 14 bosses... in PC. Minecraft has 3. ( Thanks for telling me =-=TheDragonBorn03=-=! ) Terraria has +70 Swords And +50 Armor sets while Minecraft has less than 10 of both of those. I hope this review helped you chose wether to buy this game or not, And thank you for reading this far!   So, in my opinion, Minecraft is the superior for building and has almost endless worlds horizontally. Terraria is the superior for Fighting, Exploring, And looting. It is also very addictive and it is hard to pull yourself away from it.  Honestly, I get on Terraria for multiple hours a day and I get on it every day.  Also, The bosses are hard, especially during Expert or Hardmode, and they give you a sense of achievment when you beat them.  Just noticed that I am comparing not reviewing -_- Well, Here's a bit of a review. Terraria Is fun and when you kill a boss they drop some pretty useful Items, and there is really progress because as a beginner stuff like crimtane and shadow scales and demonite and tissue are pretty good. When you advance that stuff is considered garbage. Killing the Eye Of Cthulu is challenging... until you kill the wall of flesh or some others. Once you kill the wall of flesh for some reason... (COUGH) progress (COUGH) All non-hardmode bosses become easy.. Byyyyeeee",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam. I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play. The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago. All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary. I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag. I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time.   We've all been kids; kids love to explore. Exploration is the foundation of Terraria. You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there. Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.   There's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper. It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you. Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake. Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister. Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see.   Terraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be. It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.",1,0
105600,Terraria,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) &amp; moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best 'graphics' but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania &amp; 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!",1,1

105600,Terraria,"'This game is a Minecraft clone' -A Suck-up Minecraft Fanboy/Fangirl, May 16 2011-Present  The only reason they claim it's a clone is because it's open world, and has a few similar weapons (which technically, a lot of games have swords, and Minecraft wasn't the first) but overall, the un-modded version of Terraria is actually better than most modded Minecraft games, in my eyes. Some people complain that this game doesn't have enough content or doesn't get updated enough, and then claim that Minecraft is better (even though Minecraft only has at most 1/4th of the amout of items Terraria contains). Minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game! There are only a few things I find extraordinary in Minecraft: Creepers, anything involving the Nether, anything involving the End, and anything involving the Mushroom Islands. The list is so much bigger for Terraria! There are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semi-original or 100% original. In fact, the only thing I wish Terraria had that Minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators. This game isn't even 'endless' like Minecraft claims, and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years! I strongly reccomend this game (if you can't already tell). This game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games: lots of items, the developers stay in touch with the community, and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like: 0_0 WOW.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a small 2D adventure game. I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.  [Gameplay] In the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. 'The First Night'-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10  [Crafting] Ah.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch. The coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some 'speacial' position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...  [Bosses] This is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard. If you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!! On Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is 'The Twins' The one have 20k, the other 23k HP. Good luck! 11/10  [Multiplayer] Oh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.  [Final Review] 'Terraria' is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!  *Sorry for my bad english!*",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I NEVER expected this game to be as complex as it is!  At first I checked it out and was like 'Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D' and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected.   In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it. I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.   I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely!

105600,Terraria,"I Myself enjoy building, mining and open ended games. This is something different though. It combines the adventurous feeling of 'path of exile' and the 2D yet amazing type of art of 'starbound' and 'edge of space'. This came as a gift from my brother. He noticed that I was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and I didn't have it, so he spent his own money, or steam credit, to buy me this game. It is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment. Thanks bro.  Many people would call this '2D Minecraft' and 'pointless, silly and plain rubbish'. I however disagree, as this game has more enemies, bosses, items, biomes and many more. This game is out on many platforms and I simply love this game. 9.5/10. I would like to give my thanks to re-logic and the rest of the group for this game. It is astoundingly beautiful.  I shall now talk about the gameplay. You may customize your character's original look, and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh, allow double jump, save you from from injuries by dodging, etc. You also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour, therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style. You have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items, too. You can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat. I personally collect hats as a hobby, so I could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm. The multiplayer allows pvp, and it's own version of ctf (capture the gem). It also has teams, allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other. This game has a wide range of NPCs, ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl. The nurse can be a bit rude though... But I don't care. She gets the job done. You can build a condo by the ocean, or a mansion in the roots of a tree. You can hollow out hell, or reside in the clouds. You could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool. The crafting is fun, you can make potions easier than in minecraft, and the traders don't go 'HMMM'. That is an automatic upgrade.I just love this game, and if anybody says that it is bad, then I have a tear run down my cheek. Just joking.  I would like to thank: Redigit, D-town, Cenx, Crowno, Will, Aaron, Jim, and anybody else who helped make this game. I have changed my rating from earlier: 10/10. Terraria has a lot of potential, yet is still a FANTASTIC game.   Anyway you look at it, it is full of colour and beauty. Thanks. This is a true game.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.  Terraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.  One of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.  Of course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real 'story' to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.  Firstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in 'congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements'. I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.  Now, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.  Speaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this: - Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt. - The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot. - The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself. - And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier.  What I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.  Enough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are. - Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that - Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that. - Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that. - Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.  Finally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the God damn Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long.   Look, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!     Enjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator! I recommend many games similar to this one.   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JacksGamesOfChoice#curation ",1,1
105600,Terraria,"  Holy hell. What a ride this has been.   I first recieved this game when I was selected as the winner of a giveaway. I thought, 'Whatever, I've played Minecraft. This game is probably the exact same as it.' After all, there are certain similarities between both games. Find yourself stranded in the wilderness, mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win.  But the similarities end exactly there.  Now, this game, in the starting phase, is actually quite bland, and I nearly quit because of it at first, but with the help of some friends, I stuck with it. It was pretty generic stuff. Mine some boring ores, build a boring house, feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon, or dying and dropping your money. You'll die quite a bit as well, but don't let that discourage you. The moment I realized the exact depth of the game (and realized Iactually loved this game) was the moment my friends and I summoned what is to be considered the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. The intensity of the battle, especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor (hint: armor is your best friend!) made victory all the more satisfying. The adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses Minecraft in it's entertainment value. Yet I believed that was all the game had to offer, that one bit of awesomeness.  WRONG!   Excluding event bosses, there are over 14 different and unique bosses of Terraria, each with their own unique powers, and in Expert mode, their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack, from the Eye of Cthulu's blinding fast rushes to the Skeletron's deadly skull spin. No two bosses are the same, nor can they be approached in the same way. Nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building. But that's not all. because you know what's better than killing a boss?  Sweet, sweet loot.   Emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration, but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better. From shields that allow for bash-like charging, to a scarf that reduces damage by 17%, every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot.  Now, about now is where you can pick your specialization, especially if you're playing with friends. Will you be the hulking tank, absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates? Or the looming mage, casting deadly spells from behind, or an archer, raining down death from above? It doesn't matter. After all, in Terraria, you're free to do what you want.  And right when you think things are getting bland again, hardmode hits you. All of your weapons and armor's effectiveness is quartered. Enemies are a challenge again. Venturing out at night is a near death sentence. New enemies will spawn, and new loot along with it. But again, don't be discouraged. You'll die quite a bit, after all. Build your strength up again, and go kick some ♥♥♥.     ",1,1

105600,Terraria,Fun fact : its possible to like both minecraft AND terraria       ,1,1
105600,Terraria,"The most used comparison for this game is Terraria/Minecraft. I shall explain the difference between Minecraft and Terraria (edit: terraria is better) Exploration- Minecraft- 3D world, practically limitless, several biomes, intresting underground areas. Terraria- 2D world, you can control the size, several biomes, deeper underground areas. Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc. Building- Minecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily. Terraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get. Combat- Minecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon. Terraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability. So Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft. So there. Shut up about this game being a rip off, you Minecraft-F-N-A-F-fanboys-who-will-rise-to-protect-'the-best-games-of-all-time'.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I was digging and a spooky skeleton sent shivers down my spine.  absolutely 10/10 game, especially with friends. If you're a fan of sandbox games, this one's for you.   But it still needs spook alerts...",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Terraria is a 2D Sandbox Adventure game that's all about building and fighting giant monsters. Sounds like another popular game, right? I assure you, it's nothing like it.  In Terraria, you are the player. A custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace. Not to say that the game doesn't have it's fair share of building, aswell.  The combat is sort of simple, yet charming. I always love going on expert mode with my end-game character and fighting a bunch of bosses. It's always good fun. And while I may not be the best at building, I enjoy it too.  Terraria has to be my favorite game of all-time. Period. Just throw 10$ USD at the screen to get it, seriously. It's dirt cheap.  If i missed anything in this review, don't tell me. Go make your own review. I'm sure you can make something that's much better than what i can do.  ..What's that? You already own the game? Well what the hell are you doing here, go play it!",1,1

105600,Terraria,"You can nuke waves of zombies with explosives bunnies. You can pelt Santa Claus to death with rotten eggs. You can murder enemies with bananas.

105600,Terraria,"*EDIT* 6/30/2015  Steam Multiplayer has now been added!  When I first saw this game, I thought of it as another Minecraft clone. Now that I played about 100 hours on record, I now know it isn't a clone of Minecraft, it is better than Minecraft in my opinion. Its a 2D adventure game, with alot of bosses and crafting. One thing I don't like about it, the Steam multiplayer. In most games, Steam allows you to play with other people using Steam, in Terraria you have to host your own server. At the end of the day, Terraria is a great game, and I recommend it.  10/10",1,1
105600,Terraria," Introduction:  Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.   Pros:  -Customisable characters with cloud support.  -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from. -Various mounts and pets to choose from. -Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour. -Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers. -Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses. -More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying). -Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.   Cons:  -Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).   Overall:  Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game. I personally rate this game a 9/10. :)",1,1
105600,Terraria,"This game is like a time machine, only that you can only go foward.   For example, start playing at 8 pm. Blink. Now its 4 am.  See? Magic.     I would rate this: my time played/10",1,1
105600,Terraria,"I remember.  Started to play a bit more games than just CS:S and CS 1.6. My brother had found this new awesome game that could be a potential minecraft, but for slower pcs, and with a hell lot more content.   Back in 2011, you had to hammer crystals. You had to use a wooden axe to cut wood blocks, not a pickaxe. You couldn't get past a 1-block tile withouth jumping. Background was ugly, so was the sun. Rocket boots needed mana. Liquids were buggy, so were walls, there was no expert mode. The Twins were awfully hard, so was the destroyer. Star Cannon was OP. Making a bridge to fight WoF was tedious. I had pirated this game, i'll admit that, but even then, even with those annoying things, even with the sluggish gameplay it had, it was one of my best times of my childhood and the most fun i've ever had with a game, so beautiful seeing it develop like a great Indie Game deserves.  Thank you Redigit. You've made my childhood brighter.",1,1
105600,Terraria,"What is Terraria? Terraria was a game that, often mistaken as a 'Minecraft clone' and often seen as '2D Minecraft'. Even after all that nonsense, Terraria was still a unique and a very young 2D adventure game that dragged many players into its world. After 1.2 update, Terraria became even larger, selling millions of copies, but then just after 1.2.1, it began to slowly die off. Fans were crying for it... Not until something wonderful happened. Terraria was released on consoles, slightly extending its life, and then, there were rumors about a big update for Terraria on PC. The 1.3 update was litteraly an explosion of new content, and yes, its true, +1000 items were added into game. This has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history. Free updates are still coming, adding more and more content, together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun.  If isn't obvious by now, Terraria is much better than Minecraft in all aspects. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too, but Minecraft alone will be never as good as Terraria currently is. So, what does Terraira feature that makes it such a great game? Let's start from what you can do in Terraira:  FIGHT! From smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with, to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe, you will learn (in a hard way) how dangerous the lands of Terraira really are. You are nowhere safe, not even inside your own home, as during certain events, swarms of enemies will break into your house, attempting to turn you and your fellow NPCs into a pile of mangled corpses. Hell, even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness (if you haven't defeated them yet). Even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies, your world is still in danger. There are biomes, seen as 'evil', that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world. You are only one who can prevent this, so you better get a move on!  You will come across thousands of enemies, as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them. There are so many weapons to choose from, that everytime you start from beggining, you will find different set of weapons and armor to use. This is what makes replayability in Terraria great. From weapons, you have: swords that are ten times larger than your character, swords that shoot swords, bow that makes arrows rain from sky, large variety of machineguns, launchers, pistols, laser weaponary, craziest magical items you'll ever see, lots and lots of ammo types, and much, much more... Once you got yourself a good gear, its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating. Gain their loot, and progress deeper in world of Terraria, eventually unlocking the 'Hardmode' in your world, where real adventure begins and where only real heroes (your characters) shall become champions of Terraria!  BUILD! Hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from, Terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there! Most of blocks have their own theme (e.g. Marble represents acient Greeks), as well as their own set of furniture, such as bathtubs, tables, bookshelfs, lamps, etc. Some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building, meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items. Once you got everything you need, its up to you what you want to build. A house made entirely out of bones? Slime? Glass? Honey? Or make it steampunk themed, alien themed, have golden toilets, garden full of large glowing mushrooms, color shitfting blocks, beds made out of flesh... I can go forever like this, the options, are truly endless! You can even shape blocks with hammers and/or color them, build traps with wiring system, wall tappets, decorations, paintings... Remember, you world... Is your canvas! You can get NPCs to live inside your marvelious creations, and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful.  Oh, and also, you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground. These blocks are made for pixel art!  EXPLORE! A small world of Terraira contains everything you need, but just imagine what large worlds offers. All you have to do is explore them! You will find large variety of awesome loot, accesories and weapons for your character to use, statues to collect, and most importantly, ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health. But beware, as I said, nowhere is safe. Underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist, as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches.  If you have hard time exploring the underground, try fishing! With fishing, you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground. All you need here is bait, good fishing rod, patience and with enough luck, you will be swinging fish-swords and shark-pickaxes at your foes!  COLLECT! Collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun. Being able to own everything that exists in Terraria is satifaction at its best! If you like collecting stuff, you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings, hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again, just to get that one item that you don't own, only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again. Or a throphy to decorate your walls with. Ah, lovely!  CUSTOMIZE! In order to customize your character in a way you really want, it needs a lot of effort. You will need to fight and explore a lot, as well as get NPCs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them. Terraria also features 'social slots'. With these slots, you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives. In-case you find one armor likeable, but you don't want to wear it because you already own a better armor, just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it, and your actual, better armor, will still provide you its perks and abilities. Social slots are made for cosmetic purposes. You can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors, as well as using hair dyes for hair. There's an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft, as well as rare dyes that glow, have animations, reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects.  Should you buy this game? Why, of course! Its worth every single copper coin. And has multiplayer too, which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddy/buddies to play with. It has holiday events during halloween and christmass, where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events.  I gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun, as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that Terraria can offer. Well, will you?",1,1

105600,Terraria,"I'm going to be honest, at first I hated this game. I mean, absolutely despised it. But believe me, when I started crafting better gear, fighting new mobs, and building my home, I became immersed in Terraria. There's an endless amount of content here for only $9.99 and if you were like me thinking this was just a 2D Minecraft rip-off, you couldn't be more wrong. Definitely a must play. (And yes, like always, the PC version is far superior of the console versions.)",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.  The game has 2 stages :  1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer 'tutorial' where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.  2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).  There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.

105600,Terraria,"Well I think it's about time to review this gem.  Terraria is one of the best value-per-dollar games you can buy on steam. Period. Obviously some of the free-to-play games can match that value (because you spend nothing) but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous!  Ever since 1.0, there have been 3 absolutely game-changing updates, for completely free. The game was already worth it just at 1.0, apart from bugs, but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game. 1.0 got the basics right; satisfying combat, fun exploration, lots of sandboxy things to do, but as I just said, it's sandboxy; there's a lack of an appropriate ending besides 'get the most powerful stuff.' 1.3 gave us the Moon Lord which is the equivilant of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft; it doesn't end your game after you defeat it but it's something tough even with the gear you get from him, so it feels like a climactic end.  You'll start off small with your copper shortsword, or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it. After many hours you'll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you, from bows to guns to MAGIC, and from simple 'take less damage' armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends.  On top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding. There's so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing, and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun. On top of those cosmetic things you also have the (as of a recent update) fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or opening/closing doors.  And on top of THAT you have the massive variety of enemies to fight, some of which will completely obliterate you and you'll enjoy every minute of it. All of the bosses have their unique elements and you'll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out (like the first time that the Corruption boss comes out of the ground).  AND ON TOP OF THAT you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesn't have enough content. Whether you just want more content or complete overhauls, the modding community's got you covered in user-friendly mod managers and easy mod installation.  So basically I'm saying the game's pretty good and you should buy it if you haven't already with how often it goes on 50% and 75% sales.  EDIT: Also you guys should totally nominate this game for the 'Test of Time' reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and it's one of those games that pretty much every person on Steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"'2D Minecraft' - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.  Terraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an 'ocean' with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems.   Terraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.  Throughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.  And when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.  So is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with! (Co-op always makes games better).",1,1
105600,Terraria,"Massive creative time sink. Dig like a boss.  This is one of, if not THE best values on Steam for the amount of time you can play it vs. the money you will spend.   Terraria has had two massive updates for free already, as well as both a Halloween and a Christmas update that added many more items, enemies, events, and bosses as well.   The game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game.  Exploration, mining, and item collecting is a big part of the game. With the 2 major updates, and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find, get from bosses, and simply craft. For the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50-100 hours searching for all of these alone. You can find and craft armors, melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons. You will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others. You can plant gardens for potion ingretients, find special keys to unlock more chests, banners, paintings, statues, etc. for decoration. You can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks.  Boss fights are for the more action orientated players. The game has 2 modes. You start in the normal, or 'easymode' we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldn't be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons, armors, and accessories. After defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into HArdmode. This is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear. You also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find.  The real longevity of the game, however comes in the crafting and building aspects of Terraria. AFter you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores, found your gears, etc. you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures. The game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport! The building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game.  Not only can you do ALL of this alone in single player, but Terraria has CO-OP/Multiplayer! You can do everything you can in the single player mode, but with friends! Share and trade items with others, go and fight bosses together, or join together and create a massive art project, or city. Look around the net for Terraria artwork. There are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the Terraria players out there.   Terraria is one of my favorite games I have on Steam and is one that every STeam gmaer should own. The game goes oon sale regularly at 75% off so you can get it for $2.50 regularly. It's a steal even at full price.   Also, don't forget to check out Terraria Online for the wiki and the modding community. This game has a very nice and active mod community. So even after all of this you can still get mods too!  The game also has trading cards.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. Old old Terraria.  I used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server, it appears I played almost 140 (138) hours of this game and it was pretty darn good.  Terraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie RPG with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is NOT a Minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination, no no no. To some, it could even be better.  Terraria features a huge amount of enemies, items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed. It also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome.  First off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason I love the game are the amounts of items, there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse. Let's just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed.   Next off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses! From a giant worm to Cthulu's old eye, there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game.  However, Terraria still has it's flaws. And one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why I don't play anymore.  There is a large amount of grinding involved. Certain enemies drop certain items (Skeletons and Piranhas used to/still do drop hooks, but only Skeletons and Piranhas) and some have very low drop rates. Again, this might have been fixed. However, that was merely one floor amongst many positives.  Back to the positives: One thing I forgot to mention was the housing system. Whenever you make a compatible house (You can't just make a random crevasse and expect it to work, you need to create a proper actual house) an NPC will move in, but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the NPCs respect, such as kill a boss which I think you needed for the Dryad. There are many, many NPCs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things, especially the Nurse who seems to have a crush on the Gunslinger, but again nothing is done with that. Don't expect cute Guide X Dryad crap to happen, sorry shippers. That'd be cool, if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more NPC's.   There is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns, they're all unique and it'll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies, and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is INSANE. It'll take estimated 200 hours and over (Don't quote me on that) to see every little tiny bit of content, if not 300 hours. But once you're done with that I'm not sure if you'd want to come back to it.  And finally... The combat system. It's very basic, especially melee wise. But once you get late into the game you'll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items that'll mix everything up.  And the final verdict for Terraria is... 6.5 out of 10. I feel bad for not ranking it higher, but the grinding (and the fact that it's not really my kind of game altogether) causes it to be a 6.5/10, which is a 'great game!' to me.   Until next review :) Bye!",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.  One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.  As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.  There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.  As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.  Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.  That is what this game is about.",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ♥♥♥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",1,1
107410,Arma 3,"My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever.  We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.  I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.  Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?  The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. 'SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON!

107410,Arma 3,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg.

107410,Arma 3,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.",1,1

Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group.

107410,Arma 3,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.  Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.  At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.  Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.  For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here’s me trying it anyway.  The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.  I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I’ve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.  What you don’t get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you’re in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you’re sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing.   The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.  Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more? Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.  Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn’t the game you’re looking for. Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign – those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don’t expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before – the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.  Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players.   So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I’d certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.  I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I’m not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I played this game about 90 hours which is more than any of my friends at the moment.  Can't really compare it to any other game. Arma is just Arma, period. xD If you haven't played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles, but no, not really. Most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out. Then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds. Repeat.  Playing this game requires strategic thinking - you can't just take gun and take enemy out, no, it doesn't work that way. This game features two maps: big and huge, including towns, forests, mountains, flat fields and graaaas grass grass. Yeah, i love grass in this game - looks fantastic. xD So... Where was i? oh, right, the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles, civilian vehicles, helicopters or planes... You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods. Repeat.  Anyway, this is nice game(yet you need some great rig to run it) with limitless editor and mod support. Best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends. Team Work is necessary.  Pros: +Limitless warfare simulator +Graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time +in-game editor allows you to create your own missions +Steam workshop support: download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles. +It's not CoD +It's not BF4 either +Bugs are fun  Cons: -It's probably boring for players from other shooter games -Limitless CPU usage: your cpu will cry like a вitсh during the 100 vs. 100 battle with tanks and helis. -Graphics doesn't look beautiful 20% of the time. -Not so big default weapon arsenal(but there are mods, hey) -Multiplayer performance sucks sausage -Campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in Arma 2 -Bugs are still bugs even if they're fun -AI has IQ equal to chair.

107410,Arma 3,"While the animations, graphics, lighting, and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the ARMA series, I miss the ARMA 2's setting, units, and mods. ARMA 3's 'future-istic' setting doesn't make sense, and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd. While I appreciate the new vehicles such as the MRAP 'Hunter' or the newly updated 'Ghosthawk' (Blackhawk), or any of that sort of updated feel. I'm not saying change is a bad thing, I'm just saying sometimes too much change isn't.  A great addition to the ARMA series, was the much requested 'stances' available to you during the game. Whether it's leaning from standing, crouching, or even laying on your side in the prone position, it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks, windows, and walls that you're either too short or too tall for. There are 3 standing stances, 3 crouching stances, a sitting position, and a prone position. Every stance except for sitting, allows you to step out to the side, or lean around cover. From the prone, you can peak a corner, or lay on your side. This vastly improves over ARMA 2's restricted movement. It would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls, or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well, but that's just wishful thinking.   Another thing I noticed, is the sound of the weapons. A lot of the weapons have similar sounds, which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you're getting into. While some of the sounds such as explosions, vehicles, and other small ambient additions are nice, I feel like I'm often confused and lost with the sounds. Hopefully, a good soundmod will fix this later down the road.  AI. . . AI. . .AI. . . One thing the ARMA series hasn't been able to nail down, is the AI's movement, pathing, communication, and skills. I realize that it's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this, where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective, or how, but often you'll either find your allies falling behind, running out of formation for a second, or asking 'Where are you' after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves. It would be nice to see AI being able to figure out things based on other AI, and not almost strictly from you. Combat awareness. Something I noticed in ARMA, is that no matter what situation, the AI in combat are lacking, whether an enemy soldier, or a friendly, you'll notice them not finding cover, running into the middle of a street, or from behind cover out into the open. On one of my first 'showcase' missions, I was instructed by my AI squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover. 'Neat' I thought. He then gave me an area to suppress, as I was an automatic rifleman. I began laying fire down from my position, my own squad leader walked next to me, and as he gave an order, ran right in front of me, bushing me back, and causing a bullet to hit him in the head, resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing. Note, the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second, leaving me no time to react. Their aim isn't that great either. You could be standing across a room and they won't be able to hit you, or they'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of-guard yet, not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it. Now, this goes both ways. To combat them being 'too easy', you could set the dificulty to Expert of Veteran. The problem with this, is that the change is too extreme. Setting your game to the highest difficulty, results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily. You could be concealed at night in a bush, and taking you out. That, or you'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley. My advice? Find some friends or a group to join, disable AI teammates for the mission, and only play with a team made up of human players, 9 times out of 10, you'll be able to accurately cover teammates, move together in a more realistic and effective way, and it will increase your expierence 10-fold. Here's an example of the Helo AI in this game.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203646487   Another weird problem you may notice, is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer. You may or many not have issues, and to top it off, it's really sporatic and without a known cause. In singleplayer however, this is not the case, and the game runs a lot smoother. and it is quite confusing, and frustrating when trying to set your settings. Here's an example. You go to singleplayer, and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering. The game looks great, and you're real happy with it. Now your friend hops on, or you want to go play on a server. You select one with the best player/ping ratio, and join it. You notice right away your frames are a lot worse, and you sit the tinkering with your settings again, mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game. Not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game, but when you join back to singleplayer, the game looks worse, and you either have to deal with the settings again, or get stuck with lower graphics. Now, changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either, so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration.   Overall: If you're a fan of the ARMA series, or any realistic shooter, I'd go for ARMA 3. While I still play ARMA 2 more, ARMA 3 offers enough change when I get tired of the former. Improved graphics and lighting, vehicle handling, weapon handling, and the use of different combat 'stances', really improves over ARMA 2's static and prohibited movement. While you won't be in the deserts of Takistan, or going through the dense city of Zargabad, the Islands of Stratis and Altis, are sure to give you the variety and fun you'd want. While the AI isn't improved much, some of the futuristic units, and factions don't fit well, and the sounds can tend to be confusing, ARMA 3 is definitely a step in the right direction, and a giant leap towards success.",1,0

107410,Arma 3,"I rarely rate a game this high, but this one is a perfect 10/10 for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.  Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic, there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc. However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC, then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.",1,1

107410,Arma 3,"I've owned and played every single Operation Flashpoint, Arma and all their spin off's, and this one is sheer perfection!  Pro's -Insane level of Graphical realism at all levels. Such as terrain, textures, facial animation, destruction of enviroment...right up to bots that look all too human.  -Very forgiving game system that allows players with out of date gaming rigs to still be able to play. -The most realistic shooting system bar none! Employ the Ace 3 Workshop mod and be the sniper. The kit includes everything the modern military sniper has in his kit. Such as wind direction compass, ballistic charts, and this all comes into play with true real world ballistics. Buildings come down, certain cover doesn't provide cover. Bullets go through multiple people. With mods in play it gets very bloody.  -Unlimited number of workshop items, maps, scenarios, servers etc already out there and tons more coming.  -The best, most real online gaming experience.  -A full sandbox mode that is so good that I have not been playing anything else but Arma 3 for months. Pretty much expect to see me living in this game in my spare time. This is the best game I've ever played!!!! -Thousands of weapons, vehicles, attachments, bot types, nationalities etc. EPIC!!! -Gigantic, fully sandboxable maps that stretch miles upon miles in all directions. There must be 100 maps. I have at least 60 dowloaded and that I am playing with already. -ISIS, Taliban and other scumbagery to put hot lead into. Buckle up soldier...you have tea bagging to do!! -Here is the biggest one of all. The mods in the workshop, that are totally free, give you every single mission and map...from all the other Arma's and Operation Flashpoints. So if you liked the Arma Gold Edition and loved playing with the vehicles and different units, then Tada....SURPRISE, there in here too! So own one Arma, and own them all if you have 3 and the Mods. Just check out the mods I subscribed to and go nuts. I am! -Stupid hillarity. When you see the first guys reaction after you smoke the guy he is healing. Make sure you have the Bloodlust Mod and The Head Popper Mod on. :)  -This is a crazy one. WWII units!!!! Yes, you can have ISIS taking on an SS Panzer Division if you wish. One decision? Which scum bag to play as? There are several mods that bring WWII units, tanks, and aircraft to the game and WOW, does it make this a game and a half to own. 4 words, Moisin Nagant sniper rifle. Nuff said! -There are too many positives to go on about. The game is everything I ever wanted in a first person shooter. 10/10!!!! Cons -You down own it yet and are stuck reading this. Go buy it you cheap bugger! :P -Very few. -Still thinking.... -Stop PRESSING ME!!! -Ok, a few things. Load times are long. -The servers are filled with gaming Gods.  -Some mods will get you Vac banned, so turn off the ones that apply to getting you banned. Their pretty darned obvious and it's simple enough to do with turn off all mods button. Then just click on the few that are allowed on servers. No biggie.  -Some mods have issues with other mods, so it's like Skyrim. So expect a few crashes here and there as you figure out what works with what. However with me having over 150 mods in play at once, I'd say this is beyond minor. You are looking for gripes right? I don't have many.   So in the end I am going to say this is the FPS you always wanted. If you didn't know you wanted it and you are a gun nut, a blood thirsty nut, and overall fan of seeing heads coming off at the seams, then luck be a lady tonight...this is your game!!!",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"*sigh* where to start. It's 2015, why is a game of this caliber is being locked at 30fps? While the frame rate cap is editable, you have to go into the config to do it instead of the main menu. But that doesn't matter, the game is terribly optimized. Whether it's capped at 30 or 60fps, you'll get major framerate drops. A single GTX 970 isn't even enough to keep it at a stable 30fps, which is completely ludicrous. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing a game like this.  What makes it worse is that, at the very last hour, they edited the Steam sub for the people that got the free Nvidia copy for buying a GTX 970 or 980 so that they wouldn't get the Harley Quinn pre-order bonus. Why do that? You already give away a free game, why take away a little pre-order bonus that everyone else who pre-ordered would get?  It just ends up making a lot of people angry. For months now people have been asking whether or not the people who got the Nvidia free copy would be getting the Harley Quinn pack. They were completely unclear on it, just beating around the bush.  This is no way to treat your fans.  At this point, this game isn't worth buying because of technical issues and such a terrible practice by it's publisher. Even people who got this game for free must feel like they got betrayed right now.  Save your money, wait for updates and play something else in the mean time. I recommend the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a game that is much more optimized for PC, developed by a group of people who actually care about their fans.  Update 1: No patch yet, but after some tinkering in the config file. I've gotten the game to run at a somewhat more stable frame rate. If I stand still or move slowly I can maintain a stable 60fps, but as soon as I hop into the Batmobile or start gliding around, frame rate will start dropping anywhere from 50's down to the low 20's. The worst part is every now and then the frame rate would tank so hard it would go down to single digit, like several other people have noticed. So I guess for right now, maintaining a stable 60fps or even 30fps is impossible unless you want to play Batman: Walking Simulator.  Update 2: I got a chance to play the game a little bit, so this post will be about the gameplay. The combat and control are great and responsive, You never felt quite more like Batman than you are in this game. You feel powerful. The entire Gotham City is your playground and it feels amazing to traverse it. The only problem I have with the gameplay is that driving the Batmobile in 'Pursuit Mode' felt pretty bad. It was hard to turn around corners without smashing into something, combining with the terrible frame rate and let just say I rather just glide across Gotham City than drive the Batmobile. I really hope they tweak the control for the Batmobile, it's my least favorite thing about the game right now. 'Battle Mode' however is great, only because it's alot easier to maneuver around with it on.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Updated 10/29 for the PC re-release that happened on 10/28:  Many of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved, but if it came out as-is today I would still say the port is pretty disappointing. Many people who couldn't play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now, but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience.   The texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone, but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene.  Image quality is all over the board, but is improved quite a bit by turning off AA, CA, and film grain effects.   Speaking of effects, there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of post-processing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at. The most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered. In 1080p, lens flares look more or less as they should. At 1440p you'd think Batman just had LASIK surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on. Considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a JJ Abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating.  If you're a huge batman fan and you've been waiting to play this game, I'd say it is definitely playable now. If you're on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease, I'd say wait until it is heavily discounted.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Original review of initial release version:   One of the worst PC ports of all time.  This game had some incredibly misleading advertising. In the Nvidia gamework promo reel, posted to youtube by Nvidia on June 6 (only a few weeks before the game was released), they show ambient occlusion and rain textures - both of which are present in the console versions, and entirely absent from the PC version. The same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps, but the game ships with a 30fps cap. By editing an .ini file you can remove the 30fps cap, but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level (they look pretty similar to the textures from a Nintendo 64 game).  Aside from the false advertising, this game can't even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that FAR exceeds the recommended specifications. For example, despite having the game installed on an SSD, and running a 980ti with the latest drivers, I still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations. For example, any time I get in the batmobile, I am watching a slide show for a few seconds.  Save your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed (if it ever does get fixed).",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Edit 30/10/2015 People are still commenting on this review so I'm making this edit to let people know this wasn't updated to reflect current patches in the game. I returned the product shortly after it was released. There has since been two performance patches which reportedly improve things. I decided not to purchase it again as it's so close to November when other games launch and my time is limited ATM.  *** If your interested in purchasing the game look for more current reviews. ***   ---  Played it for around an hour so far.  The combat is fun and responsive, the gliding is great and the game looks okay (AF is set to 4 by default which makes some textures look awful). That's the good parts.  The bad parts are the framerate issues which are all over the place and the batmobile. The game will frequently pause or dip to sub 10 fps on a gtx 970 when entering or approaching new areas. Cutscenes have similar issues to witcher 3 in that while in engine they run at even less fps (by default the game itself is locked to 30, tweakable in the ini files) than the normal game making them stutter or appear stilted.  Summoning the batmobile causes major frame rate drops. At one point I summoned the car to try the batmobile takedown move. By the time the frame rate recovered the batmobile had crushed the pack of guys I was fighting including the Riddler henchman I wanted to interrogate.  The batmobile itself handles awfully. There are forced batmobile sections which involve chasing targets such as tanks or vehicles. The handling makes some turns difficult to pull off and the vehicle feels clunky. Some have recommended turning into a tank for a small amount of time for more precise control but this kills all momentum. Tank mode is really boring but necessary to take out armored vehicles. If you eject while under attack from armored vehicles batman will get upset someone is wrecking his car. There doesn't appear to be a way (yet) to deal with vehicles without the batmobile which ruins the feel of the prior batman games. Hopefully the need for the batmobile is limited later in the game.  Unless this is patched soon it's definitely a refund. I bought the game based on the prior Rocksteady Batman titles which played well on launch but this is a terrible PC port. Never really expected the game to turn out this way but I guess alarm bells should have triggered when there was no PC review prior to launch.  Edit:   For those commenting my PC is below min specs. It's not  Win 7SP1 i5 3570k 8gigs ram SSD  970 GTX  If you want to see what the gameplay was like for me see this video by RPS.

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"POST PATCH UPDATE  My did this take a while, well the game has now had a major patch and things are...better. The game is still by default held at 30fps but now an option in the menu has been added that lets you choose between 30/60/90 fps although they do say if you put it above 60 you may experience some issues with the performance. In my experience the game runs much better than before I get a solid 60fps on maximum settings (not including NVIDIA crap) during fighting/walking/gliding/grappling with almost no hitching, however I must say while driving the batmobile you can get 60 around the outskirts of Gotham but in the center where its busy and there are more npc's and other cars it does drop to around 50fps quite frequently. While this is not great it is certainly better than the 20fps it used to be when driving the batmobile.   The options menu has had loads of changes more suitable to PC with texture settings actually having an option for 'High' this time rather than just medium which brings me to the games graphics. The game looks marginally better although not really in any significantly noticeable way. While batman games always had that shiny polished look to all its textures, I find that the moody lighting and glossy textures tend to hide the fact that some of the textures just aren't that great meaning walls, backgrounds and such; but they are good where it matters I suppose such as the batsuit, batmobile and generally all character models.  So should you buy it? Sigh this is a rather hard question but let me try to expand. I feel like this game is in a playable state, not perfect...but playable. However, I urge everyone not to forget the disaster that was this games launch. In my opinion such a terrible launch and treatment of the PC community requires that we show WB and Rocksteady that this is not ok by voting with our wallets and not buying this game. By doing so, showing them that this is unacceptable and if this is the state in which you release your games and it takes you like what 3-4 months to fix this then you don't deserve our money and support. So if you don't have any strong reason to buy this game then please don't. There are better games out there that you can still buy, if however you are intent on buying this game then at least wait for a sale because working or no this game is not worth its standard price. Take note of this games launch and please don't preorder and keep an especially keen eye on WB games since its clear whatever they may be publish to PC will likely crash and burn since they don't give a damn about PC and PC should not give a damn about them.     ORIGNAL REVIEW  - Performance issues everywhere. - Had to use ini files to uncap the default 30fps lock. - I have drops to around 23fps on a rig that supersedes the recommended system requirements. - Do you have an AMD graphics card? lol good luck m8  It's a shame because there is a good game somewhere in here but the performance issues make it unplayable, I strongly advise against buying this until it is patched and begins to work properly. As it stands right now DO NOT BUY IT",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"This is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. - The framerate is capped at 30FPS - There are barely any graphical options.  - You can uncap the framerate in an ini file but then the FPS is all over the place even on my Titan X. - The PS4 version actually looks better(!!!) than the PC one becuase the PC is missing some shaders and effects  For shame, WB, for shame...

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"'Gameplay' video - real fun starts at min 6.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKy2BEHKeyE&amp;feature=youtu.be  Note: This review is a work in progress, as a PC gamer my first couple of hours of any game is playtesting and seeing the performance on my rig. I am using a 970 on stock settings and 3570k overclocked to 4.5ghz with 8 gigs of ram, just for a frame of reference. Game also uses Denuvo DRM which has been reported in previous games that used this such as Dragon Age or Lord of the Fallen to have performance problems associated because of the processes behind the DRM. It is my hope that this title doesn't see any performance impacts because of the DRM implementation, but sadly I think it is...once again. Seriously, do we need ANOTHER layer of DRM on top of the already existing DRM (Steam?) Ugh.  PC PORT IS LOCKED TO 30 FPS BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT. 'TURTLEBOATS YOU DONT NEED TO SHOUT MAN, NOW YOU ARE MAKING ME SHOUT!'  -To change the ini files go wherever your game is saved and go to: Knight\BmGame\ Config\BmSystemSettings.ini and change the parameter for 'MaxFPS=30' to 'MaxFPS=60' -To delete the intro video files go to Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Movies and delete StartupMovie and StartupMovieNV.  Graphics Impressions: The game is really hit or miss at times and while the game can look good, some textures arent as crisp and tight as you would hoped it would be. At a distance the graphics look servicable, but once you get close to even some of the thugs, they look like reused assets from the previous games. The graphics settings in this port are honestly bare bones (you cant even tweak how high you want aliasing to be set at!) The game looks a bit outdated in areas but that should not come as a surprise since the game is using the same engines as the previous Arkham games, so while they have probably maxed out what that engine can do, it does not have all the bells and whistles you would like to hope for in a next gen title. It looks as though without the nvidia settings, the max settings on this pc port is on par with its console brother. There are a limited number of specific Nvidia exclusive graphics tweaks that seperate it from the console version, so in that sense it is dissapointing.  To me the best way I can describe how the game looks is: washed out. The textures aren't crisp, enemies float above the ground after you knock them out, pop in happens quite frequently. The best parts to me graphically are the parts where you are soaring down around Gotham and seeing all the vibrant lush neon lights.  Gameplay Impressions: Combat feels better than ever, it feels a bit more faster and fluid than the previous games (got through playing the series recently so its easy for me to compare.) To me I loved how the combat worked in previous games, but felt it was just a tad slow, nice that its sped up here. No more walking through tight corridors or seeing the same locales like in Asylum or even City to an extent, this games world is massive. Zipping from building to building with Batman's arsenal makes you wish a Spiderman game was only this good at its 'web slinging' action. There is a great sense of speed while you coast from building to building and is quite fun. One moment you are on top of building, next moment you are flashing toward some thugs and blistering their bones. You can now also interrogate your victims and make them spit out some pertinent information to your mission. Launching in and out of the batmobile in pursuit of some random street thug or being propelled in to the sky all work seemless and make me excited to play with my new toy any chance I can get.  Its too bad the best moments and the highlight of the game - the gameplay - SUFFERS because of the shoddy port quality. I have had my fps drop to as low as 20 in some cases. Something I have never seen happen on my 970 before running a game on its max settings (this is without the nvidia effects toggled on.)  Performance Impressions: The games open world looks good, not great. That said for a game that looks like this it should not have my framerate stuttering all over the place at times. Other open world games like the recent The Witcher 3 actually look more impressive in many aspects compared to Batman Arkham Knight, and perform way more stable. I think the stability and the game being locked to 30fps is a very telling sign that this port was - nay - IS rushed without all the bells and whistles you would hope for in a next gen PC title.   I will update this review later with a video with my gameplay performance using the 970. Thanks for reading and I am hoping to have more detailed impression as the night progresses. As of now I feel a bit bamboozled out of shelling out money for this, yea you can fly and punch baddies like before and its open world.... but it just doesn't look or perform like a next gen title should even with the Nvidia fluff on. The Witcher 3, really made my standards of PC gaming high, not only in a gameplay aspect but graphically speaking as well.  Game feels really good when its WORKING and smooth. Heck I even had tons of fun just doing donuts and seeing the smoke effects in the batmobile at 20fps glory. For what its worth, I quite like the batmobile segments. You can cruise through walls, call it in to literally steam roll a group of bad guys, and it doubles as a freaking tank with eye popping particle effects.  The combat is tight and responsive as ever, however the performance just bogs the game down way too much for me to say that this game is an instant buy right now. Couple this with the widely known game hindering DRM Denuvo, it is just mind boggling, companies continue to support DRM practices that hinder their own game and risk the games integrity in order to make another buck or two. All signs point to Rocksteady rushing this port out.  Update 1: Game port was outsourced to a company named Iron Galaxy. Well, there it is. Update 2: Last update for the night its 4am! Uploaded a quick video of the gameplay, take care for now my fellow Dark Knights. Update 3: Supposedly new Nvidia drivers are out today - will try them out and let you guys know if anything changes. Update 4 June 24th: Thanks for everyone being informed gamers and doing their research. It is my hope as well not to only get a better product I paid for and was eagerly awaiting for just like you, but to help set a precedent for future PC titles from big pubs/devs. PC gamers should not be treated like second class citizens. We pay for digital titles that we can't sell back unlike console players, and are often left mercy to the corporations (its what they are) to fix their games. We aren't guaranteed anything, thankfully Valve is now accepting refunds and reports of customers from thid party vendors like GMG are now willing to process refunds.   This is great news for us PC gamers. We have no excuses anymore but ourselves if we continue to support faulty products even if we are given the chance to get a refund. While I am dissapointed with this port, without problems like this, we as customers would continue to be treated in such a manner and there would be no progress.   I am willing to give Rocksteady/ Iron Galaxy one chance, since they know and openly admitted to screwing up this port - thats a lot more than what Ubisoft ever did for their scam on Assasins Creed Unity for many of us. I will continue to post my impressions of the game and keep you guys up to date, as well post a follow up to the performance after the next patch. Iron Galaxy/Rocksteady, take your time - please don't rush the patch just like you did with this port. For myself personally this is your last chance. Update 5: Rocksteady has issued a public statement saying they are pulling the game digitally. In the meantime I plan on finishing the game for the review, and will post my impressions on the patch when it comes out.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Terrible port which runs like crap:  * Textures looks way worse than their console counterparts. * Ambient Occlusion missing on PC port. * Locked frame rate (30fps) * PC port developed by third party (12 employees)  This is one of the worst releases I have seen , this should stand as an example of what happens when you trust a third party company.  Unfortunately since I ordered the game from GMG I can't get a refund but I strongly suggest that people that got the game from steam should apply for a refund.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"As much that i hate downvoting a great game, this titel deserve it.. I'm running a 970 with a i7 4790k and getting 30 FPS and alot of problems (stutter, soundbugs etc). I have waited and was really hyped to play this game and it saddest me too se the PC port be so bad this time around.   (Please read the updates i do in this review if you have some questions or disagreed with me)  Pros: Looks like a great history (only 3 hours in the game) Fun combat system with amazing cool combos  Driving the BATMOBILE :o Really huge world to play in. Alot of things to do.  Cons: Bad performance.  30fps LOCK Stutter, soundbugs, etc. Bad looking textures. Really bad PC port.  Buy this game? If you dont mind the problems atm, i would pick it up BUT not for full price.  Thanks for reading the review. :)  Update 23-06-2015:  Okay, you can remove the 30FPS lock, by going to your go to this in your steam library: G:\Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\Engine\Config  Then double click on 'BaseSystemSettings'  Then press ctrl+f and type in 'fps' and now you can change that to 60 but i dont recomend going over 60 as it will most likley crash.  I still stand by the review even tho you can remove the 30FPS cap. This is 2015 and a game that release on PC should not have been capped at all.   Update 23-06-2015:  I know my english isnt good, but that should not stop me from doing this short review. :)  Update 23-06-2015: I have now talked to a support @nvidia becaruse many have told me that the game have some problems with the GTX 9xx series. Nvidia says that they have a few problems with the cards and i should be fixed ASAP.   Update 23-06-2015: After i removed the CAP and turn Blur off im getting a steady 60 fps while running around etc. Sadly the FPS drop quite alot when im driving the BATMOBILE or flyving around in Gotham. Textures are still looking bad &amp; many soundbugs still is there. :P",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"1. Horrible stuttering where the framerate is anywhere between 60 and 3 FPS when I glide or drive on my Radeon 290x.  2. 30 FPS Lock on a PC release is unforgivable. 3. NVIDIA Game Works things hammered in that makes the performance of AMD cards worse, Thanks for being a part of the team NVIDIA and Rocksteady. 4. Price of the Season Pass is too high for the amount of content that has been revealed to be included. 5. The native Anti-Aliasing in the game options still gives the game horrible jaggies. The option is either on or off for it. 6. Not many graphical options, and those there are makes little to no differance to the performance.  Cannot recommend at it's current state.

Seriously though, I've got sli 980 Ti's(I'm only using one with Arkham Knight because SLI is broken atm...) and the game installed on an SSD and the performance is woeful if you unlock the framerate. It's the year 2015 ffs a 30fps cap is not acceptable, especially for one of the biggest releases of the year on PC.   SLI is broken, along with the low-res textures/assets, streaming issues and stuttering, there is NO Ambient Occlusion in the PC version at all, rain effects/shaders are also missing that are in the console versions, just check some comparisons that are starting to pop-up. The bloody game crashes after exiting, every time. The PC graphics options are woeful, not to mention all you get are 'Low' and 'Normal' textures, that's it...really? Even at 4k there is aliasing/shimmering, and it just emphasizes the other graphical anomalies. I've never had this many technical issues with a PC game.   Also, for a game that was heavily plugged by Nvidia and makes use of Gameworks, why is there no Arkham Knight 'Graphics, Performance and Tweaking Guide' that Nvidia routinely does for all the big game releases on their Geforce website? They did one for GTA V, Witcher 3 and Dying Light, so surely Arkham Knight warranted one? They obviously knew this PC port was a steaming pile of crap and they've tried to hide it as much as they could before release. There were no PC reviews before release either, all reviews were on the PS4 version apparently.  Do not buy this game in it's current shape. Cheers.",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Yet another AAA title that fails actual playtesting and is shipped out to unsuspecting consumers who hoped it might not actually run like balls. Given this game runs on Unreal Engine 3, an engine pushing over 11 years old at this point, it has performance that makes GTA IV run like any Source game in comparison.  Rocksteady have in the past demonstrated great optimisation in previous titles. My old laptop, which ran a GT 555m graphics card could maintain 60 fps in Arkham Asylum on the highest settings. This game, on my GTX 970 (which is one of the top 10 best graphics cards currently on the market) can barely push 40 fps stationary, and between 5-30 whilst moving. Good thing we got that enhanced NVIDIA driver to improve our performance!  I think the worst part is that graphics wise, its not really much of an improvement over its predecessors. The post processing effects look really nice, and the rain effects are pretty gorgeous, but the overall texture and model quality just barely look better than Arkham Asylum, and that game came out NEARLY SIX YEARS AGO.  I cannot recommend this to anyone until they fix the performance issues. Also, you can tell its probably a shoddy console port because the left the 30 fps cap in the .ini file.

Plus, with this video card, there should be no reason for these low framerates on 'normal' settings in an Unreal Engine 3 game.

This game is the industry in a nutshell!  Well Kotaku and IGN gave it a 10/10 so at least it passed the SJW test somehow! Thank god i got this turd sandwich together with Witcher 3 when i bought my new Graphics Card and didn't pay any extra money for this pile of Dreck!",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Months ago this game was bashed by every PC user for the horrible launch. Since then I've watched and read dozens of reviews of both PC and PS versions and it was still getting mixed bad opinions. Therefore I had low expectations when I bought it a few days ago, only expecting the tech issues to be fixed.  Now that I've finished the game I can safely say it was a great and very enjoyable experience. I won't spoil anything here, not a big fan of the ending but it was a great story. All the little touches and details you would expect from the previous games are here as well. Never had a stutter or crash and I'm on a slightly above average PC.  Won't go in detail, just want to say this - if you were put off by the fail-launch and negative reviews since then, give this game a chance. I love the previous ones in the series, but this is the first one I almost completed at 100% (only riddler trophies remain and they are really a grind). And the top point of many reviewers that the CAR is shoved on you and takes away - I was afraid of that, but no, really no, it adds and takes sometimes but it's not in any way obtrusive.  If in doubt - buy on sale!",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"  SPOILER-FREE REVIEW    My specs: Windows 10 with 8GB RAM and an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.  There is a lot to be said about the final chapter of this trilogy, and while not all of it is good, I still definitely recommend the game. Let's get the BAD out of the way so that we can focus on the GOOD.  First, every time I entered the game I was warned that I only had 4GB of RAM, and that the game recommended six... *looks at my specs mentioned above, then back at warning* :\ Yep, I'm pretty sure that EIGHT gigs is not the same as FOUR, but I digress... This did not seem to affect my gameplay.   GLITCHES:  I only saw two actual game glitches. One was where a character mysteriously appeared OUTSIDE of the compound where I'd been fighting his crew, and the other was that the bat signal indicated a quest item being over the WRONG building. Not bad, as far as glitches go!   TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  They are many, and could be game-breaking if you are not comfortable with adjusting some files. I had no troubles in the beginning, but then the problems started: Lagging, crashing, and even completely shutting down my computer with zero warning. *cries* Lagging I can deal with. Crashing I can deal with. Shutting off my computer over and over again? WHYYYYY??? It started happening so often that despite how much I was enjoying the game, I was beginning to think that I'd have to stop playing...  ... and then I found the   Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT   thread here at Steam, and my hope was rekindled. It turns out a couple of files corrupt over time, and all I had to do was delete one file and one folder, then verify the integrity of the game cache (very easy on both points), and voilà -- WORKING GAME! *cue angels singing*   GRAPHICS:  If you don't have a new enough graphics card, the game won't even start for you. The plus side of the high-spec card is that the graphics are amazing. From the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers, Gotham City truly feels  alive . Every crack in the sidewalk, every fierce tattoo, each choppy wave, an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know MORE. The people may not be as attractive as in previous installments, but they are more realistic, and they truly have  character . The devs have introduced a photo mode, where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360-degree rotation to get just the perfect shot... Just use the Steam shortcut you set up (F12 default) to take screens, and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot.   THE GADGETS:  We do have a couple of new gadgets to play this time around: A voice synthesizer which allows us an extra layer of tactics by giving orders to assailants, plus the Batmobile, which I'll come back to in a bit. The gadgets are by and large underutilized and not really explained, bringing back my recommendation to play the games in the order in which they were released: Asylum, City, Origin, Knight. Not only will these previous installments give you a feel for the story, combat, gameplay, and general useful knowledge, but you'll get to play some GREAT games!   THE INTERFACE:  Most of the controls are the same as what we're accustomed to, though they had to do some tweaking in order to include...   THE BATMOBILE!  What a great addition to the series! Not only can you zoom around Gotham City like a boss, you can destroy half the city as you go~! I had great fun running down criminals (literally... Muwahaha), blowing up cars, knocking down trees, fences, support pillars... you get the idea. *evil grin* In addition to a new form of transportation, we have a great many quests, riddles, and fights to win using the Batmobile, which is not only a car, but a BATTLEmoblie! At the touch of a button we can transform it to a highly-maneuverable tank in order to kick all ♥♥♥... We can even do Batmobile-assisted takedowns with Wayne's patented non-lethal rounds. 'It's like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla!'  Many of the Batmobile quests are optional, but you will need to develop some proficiency in driving it, as eventually you'll have to use it to progress in the story.   COMBAT:  As usual for the series, combat starts off deceptively easy, then amps up in difficulty as you progress. We have the new Fear Multi-takedown ability, which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds... provided that you can come upon the group by surprise. There are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once, and during this time you can do multi-character takedowns. Those are great fun, let me tell you! ;D  We have some new attacks that we can do whilst gliding, plus the items mentioned above, but nothing really game-changing about the combat. We've got our guys with riot shields, cattle prods, brutes, guns... and a few little extra things that I'll let you discover for yourselves.   THE STORY:   When the game started, I felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline. I went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was, but why we were being attacked... Absolutely  positive  right up to the moment of the unmasking, and then... Everything changed. That which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating. My mental shift was profound, as far as such things go, and it pulled me into the story in ways I had never considered. Although one aspect of the story I had totally nailed, there were several real surprises throughout, something which I really cherish. A good story is something that I truly appreciate, but you have a good story with great gameplay, and I'm in heaven!   THE ENDING/THE RIDDLES  (Still no spoilers!) :  You must secure a certain number of criminals in order to view the final sequence of the game. You do not have to 100% the game to see the ending, BUT, to get the FULL ending, you have to defeat The Riddler, and THAT means solving, saving, maneuvering, finding, and destroying a total of 243 riddles, people, courses, trophies, and destructible items.  The riddles are the one thing I won't be doing 100% on this time around, though I did get 100% on the rest of the content.  If, like me, you don't plan to solve every single riddle in order to secure the post-Riddler portion of the ending, then NEVER FEAR, YOUTUBE IS HERE! Although some may feel that it's not really important to see that extra tidbit of story, one little sentence during this scene completely changed how I felt about the ending of the game. I'm not gonna add a link, since that's just too tempting to click, and I want this to be spoiler-free.   THE BOTTOM LINE:  Batman: Arkham Knight is flawed. The devs have no plans to fix that which is broken, but you CAN fix the problems yourself! If you're a fan of the series and can problem-solve enough to follow the instructions in the   Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT   thread, then it is ABSOLUTELY worth your trouble. I enjoyed this title immensely, despite the frustrations with the technical difficulties. I would even start the game over again right this minute if it weren't for the fact that I have so many other games that I want to play.   IN CLOSING:  I loved this game, and if it weren't for the technical problems that I encountered, it would be my favorite of the series. As it stands, I rank them as follows: Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum, and then Arkham Origins. Definitely a MUST-play!   I am Batman... I am the Night! ",1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"At this moment in time, the game is broken, and not just a normal broken, but broken in a way that some people will find it very unenjoyable.

I have a 2gig GTX 960, it's obviously the biggest regret of my rig so far but I'm waiting for the next line of GPU's to come out before I waste my money on a 980ti. I have stuttering when turning the camera, when driving, etc. It's crazy bad even on the lowest settings. I do get 60 fps in a majority of areas, but as soon as I turn the camera or drive it dips in the 40s. It's sad because the game stutters even worse when I lock it back at 30 fps.

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"*Edit* 2015/09/04 My game actually runs worse post-patch...  First off, this is an inexcusably terrible port, especially from a developer whose budget vastly exceeds the million dollar mark, I find it ironic that they delayed the Limited Edition due to quality issues yet were perfectly content with releasing this broken, incomplete mess as it is on PC. The FPS is locked to 30 by default and suffers dips to the single digits when moving fast due to what I suspect to be a texture streaming issue, while there is an option to unlock it, it's best left on as it creates instabilities and the constant drops from 60 FPS to 10 - 20 FPS make for an annoying experience. I hope the Steam refund is used in wide effect, this trend of games launching in such state is getting rather tiresome.   The game itself is mediocre - featuring the same overly simple, monotonous combat from the previous installments and most of the same gadgets only this time you get access to the Bat Mobile, which does create a few cool moments but soon becomes extremely repetitive when you're forced to use it on nearly every mission in the game. The voice acting is horrible, beyond the 'so bad it's good' mark, it comes across as tired and uninspired where the characters in-game sound like they care little for the current situation with a stiff, almost sarcastic tone and hardly ever fits the mood of the moment at hand. The world features some nice design choices and looks pretty good in my opinion, the aesthetics of the game are not too shabby either.   The plot is laughably bad, this is lower grade writing defined - not that I care much for it in most games, but in a game like this that's heavily narrative driven it's... bad. The characters are pretty dull and generic too, along with their cringe worthy dialogue that makes for plenty of moments where you're likely to let out a sigh, it's as if they read a few comic books, watched some of the movies &amp; cartoons and took the cheesiest, most generic lines they could find and threw them in there.  While this is essentially the same Batman game as before and you're likely to find some enjoyment out of it if you don't mind the monotony of being forced to use the Batmobile for a good portion of the game and if you really liked the other ones and are a fan of Batman in general, I'd recommend waiting atleast a year for them to iron this mess out and get a version inclusive with the swamp of DLCs planned - I,myself, will never buy anything from this studio again, their attitude is awful and they clearly shafted PC gamers to the bottom of the pedestal, like most AAA devs of this era do.",-1,1

My system excceds the recommended specs...all drivers are current and it still crashes 9/10 times it tries to move from a cinematic into game play. Rocksteady's response to my inquires was 'We regret to inform you that at this time we are no longer supporting or adding material to the PC release.' So Rocksteady can kiss my business good bye. They have had a year to fix this...they put it back up for sale and the game is still broken. Don't buy it. Give your money to someone that makes games that are working on release and offers support to their customers.  Update: Finally got this game working on 9-25-16. Took a lot of efforts going through forums on steam and on other 3rd party sites. I appreciate the input of so many commentators below. That said I stand buy the review and the recommendation. A player should not have to resort to the player forums, mods and the fan community to get a product to work. It is poor customer support, planning and product management. Rocksteady provided no help in their communications. Steam support actually refered me to more resources and they followed up. Rocksteady dropped the ball on this product. I called them on it. I stand by it.  Update 2: 10-18-16 After months of trying to log on to WBPlay Forums to get the Zur En Arrh skin I brought up the problem in the WB Forums. Was their reaction to provide support? Was it to unlock the skin for me? Was it to apologize for their poopr infrastructure and almost 60 day delay in being able to access content I was promised? None of the above. Instead they banned my account and access the the WBPlay site for life. Not just Arkham Knight but ALL WBPlay forums, community access and other information.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good. Yet, it's so incredibly easy.  Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective. Dark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you. It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.  Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.  In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.  Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying 'clunk' sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!  The world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that 'adventure' experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.  The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.  Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called 'Humanity' to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to 'invade' the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.  Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of 'honor' code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What 'honor' or 'etiquette' should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.  Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.  In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years. My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay. It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong.  This game is not a bully or a menace. It is not unfair. Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard. Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues. Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple. You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another. The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up. Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first.   Now you can give up whenever you want. Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time. Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove. The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed. He's teaching you by showing, not by telling. He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead. Don't fight it. He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it. Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is hard. That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned. I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use. We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen. We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome. We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death. If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player. I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator. If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless. Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience. If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up.  Another claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true. The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect. We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper. The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design. We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges. The way the lore is delivered reflects this. Does this mean that it is light on story? Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives.   Dark Souls is/was a bad pc port. It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live. DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues. There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue. Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer.   Subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games. Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction. Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind. I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles. I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to PC. I've since played through seven more times with another three characters. I suppose you could call me a fan of the series. I obviously recommend it.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself. Death is not failure, but it is common.  First, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it. I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar). I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around. I had to buy a controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&amp;K combo didn't work out. The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive. All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it.  And then I actually PLAYED the game.  And it's amazing.  Let's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own. Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons. Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game. I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die. It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival. Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits. The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out. It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head. Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing.  I don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault. I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it. This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard. Of COURSE you're getting punished. If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment.  In summary, though, this game is not for casuls. This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base. This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person. Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first. Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I was always afraid to play dark souls. I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game. And I went through all of that. And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played. And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game.  I could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game. I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it. If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will. Its almost a guarentee. You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game. And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works. There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design.  I think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses. If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine. But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated. And admittedly I did that for a long time. But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think.  Dark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point. You owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation.     Buy At Full Price    ",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"In this review I'll try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game. (°ロ°)☝   ♦ The difficulty ♦ The graphics ♦ The gameplay ♦ The lore    ♦ The difficulty  First of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty. This game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death. I often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies.  It's not true.  This game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can 'easily' kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck). I said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).  It's a challenge.  No more words needed.   ♦ The graphics  The graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful. Maybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty. The textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly. But the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect. The light is not that well done but when it's dark, for God's sake, it's really dark. Not dark like 'meh, i can barely see stuff', dark like 'Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?'.   ♦ The Gameplay  This game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps. It gives only two directed suggestions: -'In Lordran, level up and kindle at bonfires'  -'Ring two bells and GTFO' STOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses. Every single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon. Don't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without estus (potions). This game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can convoke players. Last but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the souls and the humanity you had. You can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara souls.   USE A CONTROLLER.     ♦ The lore  Some people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on. But items, ambientations, enemies, will scream out loud what happened and what is going on. Quoting the director of the game:  'A well designed world could tell its story in silence.'   Watch  THIS  video. NOW.   Like a moth, fluttering towards a flame   10/10",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls isn’t an especially hard game, it’s just a lot harder than most mainstream games today. I like to say it’s an early 90’s action RPG with modern 3D graphics and controls, in every aspect.  The central thing that sets Dark Souls apart (as well as Demon’s Souls before it) is that it actually tries to respect the player’s intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices today’s mainstream games adopt. It doesn’t hold your hand. It doesn’t constantly prod you in the right direction. It doesn’t spoon-feed you the storyline. It won’t try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do. The developers at From Software aren’t even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game. Dark Souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do.  In terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player I personally would say Dark Souls is about in line with most Super NES games. It actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic Mega Man and Mega Man X games. While playing you have to accept the fact that you’re going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation. Most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game, but From Software doesn’t care.  Dark Souls is definitely a punitive game. When you die you lose “souls,” a resource representing both your experience points and currency, which you get one chance to retrieve. Checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game. Though you can save and quit literally anywhere, the game auto-saves after pretty much any action, so every single decision you make, big or small, is final. Many people have called Dark Souls the ultimate example of “tough but fair,” in video games.  Even the tutorial manages to be at once smooth, enticing, and a bit challenging. The first time I tried Demon’s Souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls (which are basically the same in Dark Souls). It’s a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand, (on an Xbox 360 pad) the B button representing dodge, and the management of a stamina meter. The rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground, immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper. The tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesn’t ever stop you to talk your ear off.  Dark Souls even manages to stand out among action RPGs by nailing a unique balance between RPG stat-building and action game skill. It’s not a twitch game at all -- its action combat is rather slower than most games, requiring good timing, patience, and attention to enemy patterns (a lot like old school game but in 3D). As an RPG Dark Souls is about watching equipment stats (your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game), resistances, and a few other base stats, but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills. In fact, with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior, it’s possible to beat Dark Souls with a level 1 character.  Another part of Dark Souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design. It takes many hours to realize it, but Dark Souls is basically a 3D Metroidvania. Its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal, each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design. Oftentimes a “checkpoint” in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didn’t even know was there.  One of my favorite things about Dark Souls though -- what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten, is carry a dark sense of mystery. Its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity. It’s a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like Ultima Underworld. From Software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction.  Dark Souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself, never really giving you much of any clues as to what you’ll encounter next -- only just enough warning for ever-vigilant players. At the same time paying attention to environments, item descriptions, and NPCs starts to reveal what’s going on in the story as well as some of the game’s lore. Things like this are pretty much the game’s only storytelling devices.  Those environments show Dark Souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics. The game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles PS2-era games, but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies. It’s all medieval fantasy, but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy. Dark Souls obviously doesn’t pull its looks from other RPGs, but rather straight from actual medieval architecture, clothing, armor design, and fables.  Dark Souls isn’t a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the PC port’s rushed development cycle. Unless Durante’s DSfix is applied, the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second, and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended. Furthermore, your performance is highly dependent on your CPU’s base clock speed. If it’s under 3.0GHz you’re going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads you’re running.  Dark Souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation, but if you’re tired of AAA games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually let’s you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment, Dark Souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values.",1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is an incredible experience that challenges you in many ways. It can be difficult, but outside of one mid-game boss fight, it never seems ridiculous. Dungeons are extremely well-designed. I have played a lot of RPGs in my life, and this seriously has some of the most interesting, huge, incredible set of crafted dungeons I've ever seen. In addition to this, the game is beautiful, and the boss battles are intense and memorable.  For the uninitiated, Dark Souls is a combat-oriented RPG. The world is beautifully designed and rendered. The aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous, breath-taking vistas to eerie, haunted locales. The sparse NPCs are laconic, have their own agendas, and come and go despite your desires. There are no random, unimportant NPCs in this game. The world of Dark Souls is dangerous, mysterious, and lost. The game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps.  That said, this game can be very frustrating. I die a lot. I have fallen off cliffs. I have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character. I have been killed by other players repeatedly. I have been poisoned. I have been ambushed.  So is it fun? Yeah, I think so. There is something exciting about exploring your way through a booby-trapped fortress that would give Indiana Jones a run for his money. It is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness, beat him to a pulp, and walk away with his magic ring. It's exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when you've come way too far to go back, but don't want to dare fate and push ahead. It's exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you. This game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes.  I recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.  I really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I was a bit afraid of trying this game because of its reputation of being difficult. After 200+ hours of playing, I think that yes, it's challenging and it will test your patience (first time in Sen's  funhouse  Fortress) but it's not as difficult as some people make it seem.  What I liked: - Melee combat - I usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun. - Gameplay - The pace of the game play is on the slower side, and involves a lot of trial and error. You'll die quickly if you try to play it hack-and-slash style. The more you die, the more you learn. - Level design - Interconnected areas, hidden areas, shortcuts. Sen's funhouse :p - Loading screens - Only a few loading screens (when loading your save, when you die and respawn, and when using fast travel). - Skippable cutscenes - Most cutscenes are skippable. - Visuals - It doesn't have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful. - Weapons - There are a lot of weapons in this game, with different movesets for each kind of weapon. - Armor design - This is usually my pet peeve in RPGs. I was surprised that a Japanese game had practical-looking armors, and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many RPGs. There are ridiculous-looking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them. - Jolly cooperation :D  Meh: - The trek from bonfire (spawn point) to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times. - No pause (probably because of multiplayer). Not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards. During boss fights, if you have to take care of something for a short while, you can't pause so you'll have to repeat from the start. - Lag during invasions (fixed by Alt+F4 :p )  Other stuff: - Using a controller is highly recommended - Use DSfix to fix the resolution, remove 30 fps lock, use texture mods, etc. - If you've seen 'Edge of Tomorrow', that's basically how Dark Souls plays like.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Short version : One of the best RPG games EVER made, that's coming from a gamer who's played over a hundred RPG titles in his life.  Dark Souls - 9.5/10  [I myself put in around 400+ hours on my PS3 version until people stopped playing Dark Souls on the PS3, that's when I bought the PC version and the rest is history.]  Long Version : Darks Souls..... so much to say about the title. It's not your average day game, that's for sure. The game throws the player in a very difficult world, not just by gameplay standards, but plotwise as well. The narrative is played in such a way that it's never speaking to the player, but rather to your character, it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it, only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining, and from then on, you're completely on your own for the rest of the 50+ hour journey. Unless you get a co-op partner or go through some guides on the internet.  Dark Souls boasts a great online system that originates from it's spiritual predecessor Demon Souls, one that was revolutionary when it came out. You can invade other people's world, like literally, their own game world, just like they can invade yours, but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances. You can also allow other people to summon you to their world, so you can help them fight tough bosses, or protect them from other players who invaded their world.  Dark Souls has covenants, which are ingame clans. Different covenants has different attributes, you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses, abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it. Dark Souls' online system is great, but it's connectivity issues are still poor as of today, but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun!  The story of the game won't be told to you directly, you won't get cutscenes where NPC's tell you stuff and action scenes occur.... no, that's now how it is. You'll learn the story through character dialogues, item informations, the appearence of an area and boss battles. Yes, boss battles gives you a great deal of story, you learn why their fighting you, aside from demons, no enemy in the game is actually a villian, they're fighting you for their own reasons.  Dark Souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay. A lot of people say that the gameplay is broken, but if you play it for some time, you'll understand how beautifully crafted it really is. You can perform so many movesets, no other game that I've played has such a thing. To kick, to jump attack, to jump, to parry, backjump, to roll, to attack with your right or left hand, to heavy attack with your right or left hand, to block, to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage, to backstab, to use bows, crossbows, magics, apply magical effect on your weapon and many more. So many elements, it's literally the perfect gameplay for me, it feels so real, and so technical. When you defeat a tough enemy or a boss, you feel like the best dude there ever lived, like you've achieved human perfection. That's how satisfying the gameplay really is. It's simply magnificent, totally worth buying, truly worth playing.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"- Personal Rating - 'Must own Instant Classic' - Traditional Rating - '9.5/10'  This game... currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and Video Games in general. Dark Souls, storywise is what's considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a 'Find it Yourself' and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in it's design, it drops you in a huge expansive world, where you, as the 'Chosen Undead' are tasked to braving the world of Lordran to either save or destroy an age.  I personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever, and is one that's mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards. The game starts you out at an Asylum as you escape from it, the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from (at the time being) as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead, enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the Character Creator. What you do with this information here will carry out through the ENTIRE game. As soon as you defeat the Boss and escape the Asylum, your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go, you're given a goal - Ring two bells, and that's it, it's up to you to find out why and what for.  The game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses (this also holds true to bosses). There are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them. After you kill an enemy, you collect their 'Souls' (that save as the game's style of currency) that is used to not only level up, but to buy items, weapons, etc as well - enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be. The world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further re-inforces the 'Figure it yourself' type of story; pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on, from villages, to rotting bridges, to an area mostly populated by dragons, to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim - there's no shortage of level design to be found here, and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so, as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way - as you make your way to the nearest bonfires (checkpoint system for the game).  The leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything. What the game won't tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat (50 generally) those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways. These stats are essential to building a certain character, similar to an MMO. By leveling up a stat like, Intelligence for example, you'll be building up a Mage, like building up a stat like Strength or Dexterity will most likely build a melee style character. There's no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day.  As far as the Online Multiplayer goes - this game has one of the most inventive systems in place. If your character is undead, you cannot summon other people (or NPC Phantoms) to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded. Invasion is, in my opinion, what makes a game like Dark Souls the game it is. Invasion is when another player (and in some cases an NPC) comes into your world sporting a dark red aura (in certain other cases a Dark Blue aura) and attempt to kill you, as well as you can invade another player's world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity. Humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general. Humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire, while 'Human' is when you can be invaded or invade others, and summon other players or NPCs.  There's a bunch more details to this game I could go on and on about, but if you're reading this, you're most likely either looking to continue supporting Dark Souls or buy it. If you haven't bought this game, and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance, get this game. It sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons, it's a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls, perhaps more than any other game on the market, is preceded by a reputation. From its ultra-imposing, ultra-intimidating bosses, to the alienating community mantra of 'git gud', to the game's own subtitle of 'Prepare To Die', the message seems clear: this game is hard, and you're going to die. A lot. The reality is, thankfully, quite a bit more complex than that. While Dark Souls seems destined to make an appearance on nearly every 'most difficult games' list ever compiled, to place a disproportionate focus on some sort of perceived insatiable sadism is to sell the game far, far short of what it truly has on offer. Consider the whole picture, and it's little surprise that the Souls series has essentially spawned an entirely new subgenre unto its own.  At its core, Dark Souls is a game that demands to be respected. Every step you take, every swing of your sword, every swig of life-giving Estus is subject to an assessment of risk. New players quickly learn that while sharp reflexes don't hurt, it's caution, calculation, and preparation that make the difference between 'VICTORY ACHIEVED' and the infamous 'YOU DIED'. Button-mashing and face-rolling will only see you sent back to the last bonfire, but with a bit of patience and a cool head you'll realize that towering demons and seven-headed serpents aren't quite so scary after all.  For as much respect as this game requires of the player, it returns it in kind. Save for a select portion or two of the game where it seems to momentarily forget that it's not actually part of the Uncharted series, fights are fair and frustration is shockingly minimal. While I won't go so far as to suggest that 'no death is ever the game's fault', I will say that this game emanates a general ethos of measured punishment. Believe it or not, Dark Souls honestly  does  want you to succeed. It goes to great lengths to ensure that with enough observation, adaptation, and perseverance you will always have at your disposal every tool necessary to do so, even when your situation initially looks hopeless.  In addition to its punishing-yet-rewarding gameplay, there really is a lot to love about Dark Souls. For a game of few conversations and fewer cutscenes, its lore is surprisingly deep. While some exposition does exist as a more direct means of world-building, much of it must be pieced together through a combination of lore-bearing items and reasonable inferences made about the world around you. Much of the game follows a similar philosophy of content delivery, where there is always something new for particularly-astute players to discover. To this point, the game is perfectly content to allow even entire portions of the game world to be passed right by if a player doesn't happen to stumble upon them by chance (or by wiki).  Level design (for as much as 'levels' exist at all in this game) is another area in which Dark Souls stands head-and-shoulders above the competition. Whereas many games seem to be satisfied with horizontal expanses of isolated chunks of content, Dark Souls has crafted an intricately-interconnected and startlingly-vertical world. During the course of my own playthrough, it was not uncommon for me to be suddenly taken aback at the realization that the passage I had just discovered had opened up an alternative route back to a previously-visited location, often in a surprising and pleasantly unexpected way.  Enemy design is varied and interesting. Few games have so effectively inspired within me such a mixture of wonder, awe, and intimidation as this game has with its enemies, especially with its area bosses. Combine this with the fact that each boss has its own dedicated (and often hauntingly-beautiful) audio track playing in the background as you take them on, and boss fights tend to be as mesmerizing as they are terrifying.  The way that Dark Souls implements its multiplayer is particularly interesting. Rather than a discrete mode of play, multiplayer is integrated directly into the core game. Players broadcast messages to the greater community by placing them into the environment, like graffiti on a wall. Through certain actions, with the aid of specific items, a player may even find themselves directly crossing paths with other players themselves (for better, or for worse), without even leaving their own play session. As far as I'm aware, all of this is (or at least was at one point) completely unique to Dark Souls.  Now, because I feel as though I've done nothing but gush about this game since my fingers hit the keyboard, I must note that there are, of course, flaws. As I mentioned, there are a few encounters in this game that feel rushed and cheap, and some that feel as though they would be more at home in a 'high-octane' action-adventure game. A number of enemies are obvious near-carbon copies of one another with differing coats of paint. Some latter segments of the game suffer from level design that just doesn't stand up to what you've come to expect of it by those points. While the game's systems are generally refreshingly hands-off with regards to mechanical indoctrination, they can at times feel unnecessarily opaque, to the point where you'll be tempted to keep your web browser open to the Dark Souls wiki in the background while you play.  Finally, because no Dark Souls PC review would be complete without this mention, some light third-party modding is borderline-necessary here. The ubiquitous DSFix is such for a reason, as the game constitutes a pretty lackluster PC port. Frame rate improvements, a wider array of video resolutions, and a number of other graphical and performance-related options are likely to add immensely to one's enjoyment of this fantastic game.  What else can I say about this game? What else has already been said a thousand times over? If this game sounds at all intriguing to you, especially if you're somebody who has shied away due to its menacing persona, I'd urge you to try it anyway. With a bit of 'can do' attitude, you may surprise yourself at your ability to push through a steep learning curve to uncover an experience that makes you feel rewarded in ways that most other games seem almost afraid to do. Play this game, and you may find that most other games just don't  quite  do it for you anymore.  If you've found yourself on-the-fence about purchasing, give Dark Souls a fair shot - believe it or not, it'll do the same for you.  To anybody who enjoyed this review, consider checking out the following commentary video by Matthewmatosis. It's six-and-a-half hours long, but I found it quite informative and insightful, and it inspired my own review pretty heavily.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls has a reputation for difficulty. Git gud, they say. But it's not that Dark Souls is necessarily difficult, more that it has a steep learning curve. It can be intimidating for newcomers, as it was for me when I first played it. I got as far as Gaping Dragon and hit what I thought was a brick wall. So I shelved it for nearly two years.  With the release of Dark Souls 3, I thought I needed to give the original another chance. Boy, am I glad that I did. This time I had encouragement, and some determination. Again I struggled at the beginning, 'f*ck this game!' being uttered on more than one occasion. But then it suddenly clicked. I don't know what it was, perhaps I genuinely started to get better at the game, perhaps I upgraded my first weapon, but I know that by the time I encountered Gaping Dragon again, I knew - this time - that I would succeed. First attempt. Fist pump! That feeling when you beat something you'd considered a massive difficulty spike, there's nothing quite like it, and Dark Souls serves them up on a regular basis. It gives you such a sense of achievement, it's like a drug.  But it's not all about combat. Dark Souls rewards exploration. Not just with trinkets, but with real, tangible benefits. Those 'holy crap, I can't believe I just found this awesome thing!' kind of benefits. It's a remarkable game, the level design is inspired (ok, there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little 'tacked on'), the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent, and it grabbed me so hard I could think of little else for the few weeks I was playing it.  Absolutely grab dsfix, which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps. It's easy to implement. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, it's almost a requirement, that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face. Even now (May 2016) there's still plenty of multiplayer activity, people willing to help, messages to guide you, and the occasional invader to challenge you. It just feels right.  Gush, gush, gush, yes I know, but I don't care because Dark Souls really is that good... once it grabs you.  What? Oh. Yeah, ok. I should, shouldn't I? Ok, just because it's you, Dark Souls...

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is an action role playing game, developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games, releasing in 2011 on the console market, and 2012 on the PC. This is the second game in the “Souls” series, the original game “Demon’s Souls” was never released on the PC format. The series is set in a dark fantasy universe.   Game play in Dark Souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play. Whilst this is true, the game’s difficulty is also fair at the same time, with the game relying primarily on the player’s skill, rather than how they are geared and what level they are. At the start of the game you get your character creation segment, you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like – choosing options such as sex, appearance, name and class. You play the game in a third person perspective, you have access to tons of different weapons, and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety. Weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas, which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting Souls; this is the game’s currency system as well as experience points. The combat system in Dark Souls is one of the game’s most positive features, with system that is easy to grasp, but pretty hard to become a master of. With a lot of enemies having different attack routines, you are never quite sure how you should react, should you dodge this attack? Should I parry this attack? Am I just outright dead? Dark Souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know, you will die….a lot.   Graphically, Dark Souls upon released looked like your typical PS3 release. By today’s standards it would be considered very dated. Thankfully with the game being on PC, we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game ten-fold. If you aren’t a fan of modding games, then the graphical side of Dark Souls may be something which puts you off a little, with low quality textures, and an even worse resolution cap in place. With mods not only can you make the game look beautiful, but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want, as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps. Dark Souls has some really good sound tracks too, and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters; something just doesn’t sound right about them. Whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie; I am not sure, but there is something very different about the voice acting in Dark Souls.   The game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in. There are no loading screens, or “levels”. If you have the balls, you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game, that’s one of the games really difficult parts – making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order. Throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies, equipment vendors, and loot. The game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route.   As you can see from my play time on Dark Souls, 73 hours is a lot. In fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game. Your first play through Souls will probably take you about 30+ hours, depending on how you are with the combat system. Beating this game is no easy feat, and when you finish it, you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so. Achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand, with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully. There is also a large amount of replay ability factored into Dark Souls. You can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience, as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class.   Technically, on PC Dark Souls released in a poor state; thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed. First of all, don’t even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights. The most important mod you will need to make Dark Souls playable on PC is DSFix which can be downloaded here -  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?  – The mod is very easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod.   Dark Souls is a real test of a gamer’s skill and patience. It is difficult, but fair at the same time. If you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there, Dark Souls will be for you. I had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it. If you want the full experience of struggle, try the game without the use of wikis or guides! Dark Souls will not be for everyone, and that is fine, but I strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action RPG genre to attempt to beat this game. The game’s regular retail price on Steam is £19, 99 – whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012, you are getting a monster of a title. Sale season has been known to bring Dark Souls down to less than £5 though.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"For the past year or two, gaming lost it's touch to me. I found myself starting up games, and getting bored within 10 minutes, even new games I just recently purchased, I thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old. But still, I continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling I had when I was 14. The feeling of deep immersion, losing myself within the game, wanting to find out more, and improve myself. Then, this game happpened.  I heard about Dark Souls first about 1 year ago, mid 2015. Nothing about it seemed interesting to me, I heard it was incredibly hard, the story was confusing, and I felt like gaming was past me. So about 6 months pass, and I hear about the hype of Dark Souls 3, something about this series now seems intriguing, I still pass it off as something I'm not going to ever play though. Then it comes out, I see all these youtube videos about it, people going crazy about how amazing it is... alright I've got to at least try one of these games, where do I start?  $60 for a game I don't even think I will like? No thanks. Alright lets see number two, $55 for a game I'm not sure about? No thanks, once again. Ah, lets check the first. After a few minutes of pondering, I decide f**k it, I'm buying it, and here starts my journey.  I'm new, I don't know what the hell is going on, but this game, something about it, every time I die, I want to go further, figure out how to fix what I did wrong last. It's not Skyrim, it's not some boring repetive game, it's just... different, nothing like I've ever experienced. Then after a while, a few hours past, wait what? I'm actually... getting into a game again, I want to play more. I want to improve my character so I can kill that Black Knight and get whatever is behind him, I want to finally find a new cool piece of armour, I want to figure out what the f**k is actually happening in this world and where the story is going.  This, is a f**king game done right. Just buy it, try it out, you wont regret it. Ignore all the ♥♥♥♥ about people saying it's insanely difficult scaring you away, that is exactly what makes this game fun. It's a breath of fresh air to me, I'm only 5 hours in, and can't wait to keep playing the rest of this series.",1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,Probably the best game ever.,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation. There’s a wildly prevalent belief the game’s extremely hard. People presume the developers, From Software, sat down and looked at the history of videogames, cherry-picking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration, only to cause perspiration for others. Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins and Battletoads would likely be in there. In there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than, well, than anything you have ever played before. This just isn’t the case. It’s just misunderstood.   You see, dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of Firelink Shrine through Darkroot Garden and onto Blighttown is part of the game mechanics, part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve. You move a few feet, meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso. You try again, make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure, this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you. You think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option, or maybe a long-range effort if so endowed. You’ve learned what not to do. Now you teach yourself what to do. It probably still isn’t enough. A third, fourth, thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature. Each time you died you were that little bit wiser, that little bit stronger. Regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable. There was no stopping, no waiting. Just the desperate need to keep on trying, learning and eventually succeeding. It was incredibly hard work and around the corner there’s more to do, different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover. You have no idea if you’re going in the right direction, the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger. The compulsion is there though. It’s not a hard game, see, it’s just a game with a deep, long-lasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process, rather than the end as in the majority of titles today.   Dark Souls is essentially a third-person Elder Scrolls game for the self-hating. Like Bethesda's masterful series, Dark Souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet, classes to choose from, factions to join, magical spells to learn, a huge world to explore, and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find. But unlike the Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls doesn't reward your failures with generous helpings of EXP and leveled-up abilities, and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving. Dark Souls kills you over and over, and then punishes you for dying. If you want to make the game a little easier, grind to improve your character. If you don't like it, go play Skyrim with all the other wimps.  At its core, Dark Souls is a game about animations. You need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to, and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion. If you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you, you'll probably get hit. If you want to take a swig from your health flask, you need to know that your character will take his sweet time, leaving himself vulnerable. And when you get knocked down, your character won't scramble back to his feet; he'll lie there for a second, just tempting bad guys to move in.  You need to take each enemy type, dissect their patterns, and figure out what works through trial and error. It might be as simple as blocking, strafing, and attacking when you get the chance. Or, you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them, or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield can't handle, or use a certain type of magic. You're prevented from button-mashing by your stamina meter, which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up. The upside: When you finally get a hard part right, you feel… well, not good so much, but relieved.  Of course, there's more to an action-RPG than just the action. Killing enemies earns you souls, which you can spend (if you don't lose them first) to improve your many attributes—and RPG progression is the only way to make this game less difficult. You'll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor. You also earn a resource called 'humanity,' which makes you a little less undead, allows you to return to your human form, and offers a variety of other perks, such as the ability to 'kindle' a bonfire. (Bonfires are this game's checkpoints, and they refill your health flask; kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you.)  The visuals are well-crafted, for the most part. Dark Souls offers impressive environments, detailed and frightening enemies, and fluid animations. The creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere, too.  As for the controls, they're easy to get used to, but you'll definitely want a controller. There is a default keyboard configuration, but it's incredibly clumsy, and the developers don't even pretend there's a chance you might use it—all the on-screen instructions pertain to the gamepad. (No, you don't 'Press A' to pick up items when you're using a WASD movement setup.)  There's ten hours of new content in the 'Prepare to Die Edition' as well, making it the definitive version of Dark Souls There's a new chapter of the story, including fresh areas, bosses, enemies, and NPCs. As I said above, most players probably won't finish the game—which was up to 100 hours long to begin with—so it's not that big of a deal that this version has more of it. But if you're a hardcore Dark Souls fan, or if you're confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game, the Prepare to Die Edition is the way to go.    A Must Play ",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition," Dark Souls  changed me, as a player and as a person. But changed me a lot more as a gamer. I want to review this masterpiece but I'm afraid mere words won't do it justice.   Dark Souls  is an RPG based on a world where humanity lost the right to a final rest, as they become undead when death is upon every and each player to adventure itself out of the Asylum. There are plenty of information about the lore and such around the web, but I still feel the need to say that each story has a side, and between legends and fables, it's up to the player to uncover the truth... But what truth can be found, if not within our selves? This is the perspective that I have, and I'ts remarkable that to each, their own. Each player must accomplish his own journey to his own path and conclusion.  Dark Souls  is an open game, not only in design, but in the path's of the lore, where there are plenty of clues and perspectives to guess upon.  Even with such rich detail and character personality, it's very unique the way you'll enjoy them, therefore I must focus on something that everyone share as common belief; The amazing level design, worthy of genius appraisal. The areas, from Undead Burg - a city collapsed by despair and plague, to Darkroot Garden - a fearful and mysterious woods, to even the glorious Anor Londo - A beautiful large city covered by the incandescent sun. Among many other's where the design remains bound to a rule of commitment: All areas must be connected, and they generally are through a well placed shortcut. All levels look like a new challenge, but they end up making a certain sense where the player can only admire how well done they are. Such a logical and practical path makes advances in the game so much fun and entertaining. Each area is covered with a atmosphere that marks the player, and it marked me in ways I can't entirely describe... It's an overwhelming feeling acquired by the details of light, flora, and even sounds.  As everything above wasn't enough, we have another well common appreciation; the gameplay.  Dark Souls  is in my opinion, the game with the best character movement of all times. I know it's pretty arrogant to claim this, but I never experienced anything so complete, so responsive, so detailed, so so good. Of course, there are issues at times, but this is a game after all, it's not a science.  Dark Souls  is an abstract game when comes to in-game beliefs and theories, but it's almost pure science when moving and fighting. The controls feel natural and extremely responsive. Attacking, blocking, parrying, casting magic, everything makes me feel so special... even more when enemies are down. Anyone that enjoys defeating Boss's will love  Dark Souls , and those who don't will start to!  The game being hard isn't a lie, it's tough, but I found it to be more obtuse when come to use specific items. I believe this is no issue, as old games use to be like this, especially a game made for consoles where players use a controller. It's not an issue to me like I stated. Using the correct set up and leveling up on the right attributes can make you extremely strong and break the game, but even so, I found this to be the real challenge. Enemies are vast and committed to making you suffer, but this brings me to another important thing that make  Dark Souls  one of the best games ever... The community. I never in my life experienced such a strong, loyal and helpful community, like the  Dark Souls  fans. It's impressive, how steam forums are filled with such kind users and ready to help everyone. This to me is fascinating, because I don't think  Dark Souls  can be hard anymore, not when there are members dedicated to help and assist others. Marvelous!  To end, I must say  Dark Souls  really changed me, it made me earn resistance, patience and made me respect my foes, but mostly, my own problems and life struggles. I made friends which I still talk to, and overall I feel I earn so much from this game... I can't stress enough how  Dark Souls  really are one of my favorite games of all times.  Thank you From Software, and thank you, everyone that helped me improve in this fantastic game, and teach me the ways of the sun!",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition is the latest installment in a series of family games by critically acclaimed developer From Software. In it, you take on the role of a young Italian painter by the name of Adriano Abato, on his quest to restore color to the world and solve the mystery of why it was lost to begin with. Adriano is joined by his talking pet dog, Francesco, who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns. Francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor, however, and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help Adriano return color to the world.  Gameplay (8/10) The goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush. The more of the world that is restored this way, the closer to solving the mystery Adriano gets. While it is not necessary to repaint 100% of the world, there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so.  The gameplay is split into four phases. In the first phase, Adriano and Francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors. It's up to the player to decide where to go first, but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others. Decide for yourself what you feel capable of, but try to challenge your creative spirit!  In the second phase, Adriano must find the Three Prime Colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings. The three different Colors are Yellow, Blue and Red. Yellows will usually aid Adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun, but in some cases Adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first. Blues can be troublesome, particularly if Adriano hasn't restored a lot of churches yet. In most cases they will give Adriano a puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which depends on how much of the world's color has already been restored. The most troublesome Color by far is Red. The Reds will often say mean-spirited things to poor Adriano and try to ruin his paintings. They can be difficult to deal with, but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from Francesco, Adriano will eventually be able to prevail.  In the third phase, Adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world. Here, accuracy, speed and the number of colors collected is important. If Adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world, and if he is too slow the Colors might get impatient and escape again.  The fourth phase is only unlocked after Adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the world's color. I won't spoil the details of this phase, but it's quite intense!  There is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible. There are some connectivity issues on the PC version, but with a bit of patience it shouldn't be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun.  I give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay, which is both fun and addictive. The competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting, and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world.   Story (7/10) Prepare to Dye does not have a very complex storyline, but it doesn't need one, either. It's a family game for casual painting fun, and the plot reflects this. It's simple enough that a child can grasp it, but even adults will appreciate the tale of Adriano in the monochrome world. The twist at the end will also likely surprise most players, even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game. This is only obvious in retrospect, however.  I give the story a 7/10, because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done. It suits the game, and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously. It's a story anyone can jump into and enjoy.   Characters (6/10) The primary characters are Adriano and Francesco. Adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile. His optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world, and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world. Francesco, his talking dog, is similar to his owner in many ways, but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over Adriano's head. Nonetheless, the player won't be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes.  The personalities of the Colors are not particularly complicated, and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above. There are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning, but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to would-be players.  While the characters are quite endearing, I can't give this section more than 6/10. There is little in the way of character development, and there isn't a lot of character variation.   Controls: (4/10) Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition was ported from the Nintendo Wii to PC, and as a port it does have some issues. The original game relied heavily on the Wiimote's motion control for the painting parts of the game, and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on PC.  It's difficult to play the game as intended on PC, and many blame the rushed release of the PC version for this. There are mods to fix the controls, but, despite this, I can't really give the game more than a 4/10 for the controls as they are by default. While the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the PC, they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls, rather than rushing the port like they did.   Graphics (7/10) As I already mentioned, the game was ported from the Nintendo Wii, and the port is less than ideal. This can also be seen in the graphics, as the game doesn't support resolutions a PC player would consider acceptable. While this too can be fixed with mods, it should still be considered a problem with the port.  Resolutions aside, the game itself is absolutely gorgeous. The haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world. While the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison, they suit the overall atmosphere of the game. In many ways they resemble characters from a children's picture book.  Despite the issues with resolutions, I give the graphics a 7/10. The low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is, but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous. With mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on Steam.   Sound (8/10) From Software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes, and Prepare to Dye is certainly no exception to this rule. In the monochrome world, the music is somber, but as color is restored to the world, the music grows livelier and more colorful as well. Once color is fully restored, the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment. It's like an auditory representation of the canvas Adriano restored to life.  The voice acting is a bit cheesy, however. The stereotypical Italian accents of Adriano and Francesco get more endearing once you get used to it, but the fact that the Colors and the other NPCs have standard American accents is a bit off-putting.  That said, the voice acting can't pull down the overall sound score too much, as dialogue is not very important in Prepare to Dye. The music speaks more for the game than the voices do, and so I give the game an 8/10 for sound.   Conclusion (7/10) Overall I give this game a 7/10. While it has many issues, it's a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer. I highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"I have to admit that I avoided Dark Souls for an unhealthy amount of time. Rarely playing games above the normal difficulty, the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasn't the most compelling. I'm glad I changed my mind though, because I may have had missed out on a game I now consider one of the best of the decade.  The gameplay is fun and engaging. The art, hauntingly beautiful and original. The soundtrack, breathtaking. But what really makes Dark Souls a masterpiece, by perfectly uniting all its elements, is the world of Lordran. Its cohesive design made me question every videogame world I'd experienced up to that point. From the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle, the world's vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow. After transversing the map not too many times, I could - and still can, months after actively playing the game - definitely draw a convincing transcription of it, with all its shortcuts and intersections. In a journey through Lordram, rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused.  Dark Souls has no narrative. There are no quests, maps, or journals. What it has is the world of Lordran. The story is presented to the player through unusual elements. Item descriptions. NPCs - that have their own agenda. And most importantly, through the other main elements of the game: music, visuals, gameplay. You are never given a codex or anything like what most RPGs have. You have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it. Or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses - it's just as fun. As is taking part in the clever and unique co-op and PvP elements. To top it all off, the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched. But that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long.  A must-play if I've ever seen one, Dark Souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten.",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Dark Souls is a hard game at first. It's oppresive, it's relentless, it's punishing and it won't hold your hand. You will be confused, and you WILL die. So prepare to die. Yet, as you progress through the game, you'll get the hang of it. After dying time and time again you'll learn how to tell if an enemy is going to attack you and how powerful that attack will be. You'll learn faster routes to get to your objective. And you'll learn to detach yourself from the souls you get. You WILL lose them. The point isn't to constantly grind - the point is to learn. And while a couple hundreds souls will be an awful lot during early game, by the end you can farm tens thousands of them in a couple of minutes. Take your time, be patient. It's mostly about the journey, and the elation you'll feel when overcoming the obstacles - the insurmountable odds against you, the unbreakable barrier. You'll die and then you'll learn and then you will achieve victory. So Praise the Sun!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you. With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion. You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe. you play this game for the journey it takes you on. I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game. If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right.  10/10, hands down.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"See my hours? I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one.  Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you.  After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access. Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates. I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish. After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for. Development is slow, very slow.  PROS: +You will probably spend at least 100&gt; hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth. +Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space). +Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs. +Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations. +7 Starter races that are diverse and unique. +Modding support for this game is well maintained. +(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings. +Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy). +Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others. The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has. +OST is amazing  +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community. Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC. +Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots). +Liquid and Light dynamics are 'realistic' +Supports .ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO) +Boss fights are unique-ish  SEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone) +/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer +/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally +/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working +/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1.0  CONS: - AI can be pretty stupid - The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game. - Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons. (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP) - The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss - APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses. - Penguin crewmates are a pain in the ♥♥♥ - No ship protection in multiplayer* - Besides farming, there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base. - Mining can get boring quickly, especially if you are used to Terraria's systems** - Game has a falloff point where you sit down and go 'well, what next' (but that is quite some time later) - Some mechanics seem halfbaked, where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there (some bad design choices and flaws) - Starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated. - Seriously, the biggest con for this game are just design flaws. Like, the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely. You will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head 'Why didn't they do ___ instead?' - Techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring - Only 6 tiers? Come on, where is the 10 we had before.*** - So what are ship pets for there exactly? They do like to stand in front of my containers. - Options screen needs a bit of a rework (if you need to explain a UI, its not a good UI) - Wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks - Matter Manipulator customization is a joke  *Any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still. People are divided between 'simply party with people you trust' and 'just give us some bloody protection options'. Personally, protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit? EDIT: After some more thought, ship protection options should just be a thing, honestly. The existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are 'not everyone will be a decent or honest person'.  ** Okay lets clear this up: Starbound is NOT a Terraria copy, YES it does have elements and inspired features that Terraria did but honestly, whats the wrong in that? Imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game you've ever played. Terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps.  *** Tiers are an iffy one, they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones; Ranged, Melee and Staffs. On top of that, where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes? They totally disappeared! In a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do - this doesn't just mean a million different blocktype, just give us some more depth and flexibility. (Should clarify, technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one)  Last time i played this game on a server with friends, we didnt mine, explore, pvp, build or do quests. We all sat in a ship and played 'guess the song', if that isn't simultaneously the most concerning (gameplay wise) but coolest thing then what the hell is it.  The game's development could be described as a mix of 'one step forward, two steps back' and 'missed opportunities' because the thing is it's easily playable but frustrating.  (removed score, decided it wasn't a good choice)  Worth the money? YES... Runs on most computers? NO (as of right now, 1.0, which harbors some optimization problems)  Honestly i want to love Starbound i really do. To me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it, but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities  (25/7/16) Top review, didn't expect - gonna add a little more.(also edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings_  If anyone from Chucklefish reads this, what ARE you doing? This game is confusing, because it obviously has potential (and lives up to some of it) but falls short at the silliest of things. Look at some community mods and ideas, people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked. When you make a game it won't be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too. You added skyrails and some other features - hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example, the 'modular' Matter Manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization. I don't want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism, because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms. I would hate for this to be another 'let the modders deal with it' All that being said, good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up, you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i won't discount that.

211820,Starbound,"I last reviewed this in 2014, when the game was in early beta; It was really bad. I've come back now that 1.0 has released to see if the game is better. This review was earlier incomplete during a 1.0 playthrough, but after playing about 70 hours total of the release version, my feelings have not changed, only worsened.  I couldn't even push myself to complete the story; I searched it up, and found it was more dissapointing then i could have expected, making me actually glad I didn't go through it. The rest of the review has been slightly modified, but only slightly.   I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and have been watching it for 5 years. I wanted this game to be great.  So, is it good? is it bad? It's ok.  The game has some value to it now; the building is fairly entertaining, providing a lot of options for furniture, and ways to progress through it with farming/colonies. As well, combat has a good deal of variety, and the bosses are pretty decent. There is a lot of variety in weapon types later in the game. The story missions are pretty good in design, and hold a lot of nice secrets. The fossil collecting minigame is a fun distraction as well.  That's unfortunately where things fall off to being either poor, or outright bad.  The exploration is awful. The biomes are devoid of content minus some rare biome chests, and that's how all of the biomes work. Enter biome, look for chest, hope it has an interesting blueprint. You can't craft anything of note from the biomes until luck does you well. Alongside that there are procedural buildings throughout planets in the form of rooms and dungeons. They are sadly all handmade, meaning you will constantly find the same exact rooms/dungeons while playing. I never went through a biome underground without finding at least 3 of the same exact room; it was often 5 though. As a result of this lack of variety, lack of reward, and really a lack of anything else to look for, exploration dies rapidly. Every planet is mostly the same, and they can be grouped into a few categories; normal planet, ocean, barren, moon, and possibly asteroid.  The story is also terrible. Collect the 6 special artifacts. Done. It's badly written, and the lore is lacking in every way. If you know any of the source material/theme concepts (cavemen for floran, 1984 for apex, aztec/inca for avian, etc), then the lore and story will not branch to any interesting point whatsoever. It all feels very generic.  Weapon generation is also bad. Melee only has damage, firerate, and element, though 2 handed weapons have an extra special attack. Ranged is the same, though it has energy cost as well. There are also staves/wands, but they just change damage into level, a less varying stat. The weapons themselves are nice to use, but the lack of statistical variance means the procedural nature of weapons feels entirely pointless.  Cooking = potions, but there aren't a lot of unique buffs. You can get crew members for your ship, but they aren't useful past the first few tiers, and they otherwise do extremely little.  The toolbar is a mess. Crafting takes time for no apparent reason. Procedural quests send you to the same areas, revealing the way the system works, damaging play experience and providing lackluster repetition. As well, there aren't many actual quest types. Colonist rewards are lacking, and serve only as an alternative to normal play for getting items. As well, the thoughts and traits of colonists actually seem to do nothing in my experience. Character gear options consist of only 4 armor slots, a passive augment, and movement abilities. Customization is thus very limited in terms of character build depth. There aren't any passive gear slots other than the single augment, which are all very basic. Armor is also very lacking; there aren't very many unique sets with most being reskins, and they lack any notable special effects. Not to mention a lot of things from beta, like character customization options and techs, have been removed. And... Well, I could go on.  But after all that, I still don't think the game is terrible, it's just lacking. Badly. I focused on the negatives a lot, but those negatives are a huge part of the game. It's a jack of all trades, master of none kind of ordeal, but its not bad. I wouldn't recommend it unless it is on sale, with exceptions;  If you like animal crossing, or relaxed games about collecting and freeform building (like minecraft mixed in with animal crossing), I think you'll like it, but I'd say pick it up on a sale (say 5$). I was enjoying it for awhile based on the building and fossil hunting, but the rest of the game being so shallow pushed me to leave eventually. As well, I can say with certainty that my enjoyment value dropped rapidly over time; it wasn't even 10 hours in before I was watching youtube videos on the side to distract myself, and I only realised as of my last jump into the game that I wasn't having any fun at all, and it was just time killing due to how long it takes to find things. The game may be long, but it is not deep. I'm sure some will find enjoyment out of this, but it died quickly for me, so I reccomend it only if you are into that type of gameplay, and only on a sale...   As on the slip side, if you want a game about fighting loads of different enemies, finding unique interesting gear, discovering a strange path through progression or exploring exciting places, you are likely going to be very disappointed.  I personally hope for the sake of everyone playing (including myself) that they take the terraria style of updating and add massive swaths of content after release to fix these issues. But that's all I can do; hope. With a similar development time of 5-6 years as terraria has had (due to terraria's year hiatus in 2012), I don't know how much will change at this rate.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"I have played Starbound since its Early Access days, and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox exploration/building genre.  Among the games of its genre, Starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting. Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore “just one more planet”!  In regard of building, Starbound offers one of largest (if not the largest) selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base. It also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many NPC as you like, potentially building a whole town with dozens residents.  And uniquely among its genre, Starbound also has quests like one might expect of a RPG rather than a sandbox building game: a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by NPC in towns or those you've placed in your home or base yourself.  Only one aspect of Starbound is somewhat lacking: combat, or specifically, its difficulty. While you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped (especially at the very start), as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring, you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife. There is some difficulty during boss fights, but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go, and if you expect challenging battles that Terrarria or action games offer, you won't find them in Starbound. Some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge, but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements, like flamethrowers or laser beams, not enemies (in fact, random dungeons often have few to none enemies, and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment).  So, overall, the combat isn't that bad. Just don't expect constant challenge that Terraria or Edge of Space present.  I fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"As someone who's been with Starbound since it entered open beta I can say that This game is, simply put, the best 2-d Sandbox game I've ever played. Picture this: An open, vast universe with 4.something quadrillion planets. each unique in their own ways. There are seven unique playable races, each with a rather vast ammount of lore behind them. I was a bit worried when the developers said they would be adding a storyline, but I'm sure glad they did.  The storyline serves to direct the player and encourage exploration.  There are plenty of weapons to destroy your enemies, with each type having several special stats.   If you like terraria, I highly reccomend this game.   ",1,1

211820,Starbound,"Video games don't exist in a bubble. They don't exist independently from their makers when they're as horrifically unfinished as Starbound.

It has been months without a substantial update for a game that they swore would be released in 2013.  https://i.imgur.com/J1zHrOB.png   On top of that, the developers and moderators have taken to blaming the community for their disappointment.  https://i.imgur.com/M3JBlk8.png   https://i.imgur.com/2zJax3Q.png   They've gone so far as to blame 'vote brigading' for negative Steam reviews.  https://i.imgur.com/91TgOme.png   https://i.imgur.com/YY0UmkZ.png   And of course, they don't want you to get refunds anymore.  https://i.imgur.com/sDGmkYM.png   https://i.imgur.com/egHvklC.png   Don't waste your money.

211820,Starbound,"*TL;DR at the bottom*  Look at the most popular reviews for Starbound and 90% of them are negative even though the overall review is 89% positive. While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.  'Starbound is space Terraria' I do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too 'arcadey' for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).  'Progression is too fast' I got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.  'Interesting things have been removed' I agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes.   ---------------------------------------------------------------- In the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.  TL;DR This game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.  *Edited to clarify my comments about modding.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"This game ended up being surprisingly stale, they cut a massive amount of functioning content that made the game more entertaining, leaving the game with little to stand on compared to it's predecessor or other games in it's genre.  -The weapons are overbalanced and stratified (Magic is a joke, swords can attack in a combo but they get a huge delay afterwards if you do, all melee weapons are around the same level of slow etc.)  -All the interesting flying and movement options are removed, the morphball is the only surviving relic of this stuff, but its useless and is never necessary out of dungeons, and because it lacks any special abilities all you do is move through tiny holes with it. Like how hard would it have been to make it drop a little energy bomb to solve switch puzzles or something?   -The main questline requires you just running through same styled planets and clicking on furniture until you luck out enough to be able to play a dungeon. This could happen on your first try, or only be possible after around 5 hours of gameplay going through towns and planets per quest.  The worst part of this is, the game USED to have interesting and fun content, there used to be more than one reason to go to a moon, there used to be fun flying techs and movement modifications. Weapons used to attack in reasonably diverse ways, and actually good ones used to exist. But all this functional and fun stuff that people enjoyed from early access was taken out.  The only reason I could see, seeing as how all the stuff worked and was finished, is that they wanted these things to 'fit' in the game. Like they wanted the morph ball to be useful, so they designed dungeons and levels with holes small enough to require it. But if say, someone had a jetpack, then any dungeon with a jumping puzzle would be trivialized. Thing is, they still have jumping techs in the game, because the 'meat' of the game is still exploration, so you still can cheat at jumping puzzles, just not to the same extent. So in addition to failing there, this also means that you will never really be able to explore as easily as you want to, because the 'meat' of the game is crippled by the devs inability to work around flight mechanics when designing pointless single item drop puzzle rooms.  This game's skeleton is still a metroidvania, and do you know what metroidvania's AREN'T beloved for, platforming and balanced combat. Few people played Castlevania Symphony of the Night and then commented 'Wow I hate the crissaegrim, magic, and being a bat, climbing this tower while fighting the 800 medusa heads that spawned should have been WAY more tedious for me.'  The changes made seem to reflect the dev's desire to make the game feel 'whole' on release, no loose or frayed ends, and with mechanics at least 'loosely' fitting in with what they've done, but the aspects of the gameplay they sought to preserve by removing content are the least palatable parts of the game, and now were stuck in a crippled snoozefest.  In summary, the devs goofed with their decisionmaking and the game has suffered for it. Its a space game, throw in black hole guns, giant orbital beam cannons, jetpacks, lazer swords that can attack rapidly and in huge arcs, put in nukes that can unexist whole planets, either yielding huge mineral rewards or releashing eldritch terrors I need to fight with my ship. Throw in short range blink teleportation that doesnt suck. Make light not be an Issue for god sakes, I know the monster hunter logic of 'the more we cripple the player the more mechanics we can have to uncripple them' and that makes sense for that game, but were in space for christ's sake, ALL suits would have A light on them, and there's enough other things going on that this wouldn't be missed. Put in high gravity planets, put in planets with poisonous food so you need to stock up. Throw in floating sky cities that hover on high density gas planets(real scientific possibilty for venus colonization). Or at the very least just put BACK in some of the fun that was removed.   The game as it stands is you double jumping around samey rocks while swinging a sword one time a second and clicking alien pots to get to the next dungeon. All other content is either nigh pointless or removed, and what's left is boring.  PS: This is reposted from a community discussion.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet and get straight to the point.  IF you're expecting terraria in space, or some form of a terraria clone in anyway, don't buy the game because you will be disappointed. Starbound is to Terraria as TF2 is to Overwatch. Meaning while they look very similar in visual style and gameplay, they're nothing alike. Stop comparing the two.  If you're expecting something that's a bit more metroidvania styled in gameplay and looking for a game more focused on exploration, this game is for you.  If you have grown bored of terraria and want a new 2D expereience, this game is for you.   If you're not a fan of building and want a home right off the bat, this game is for you.  Do note, the story is great but the scan quests suck. You can skip them via admin commands, there are several guides on how to skip the scanning quests.  I do wish the developers would add more techs, especially ones that enable flight and unique movement boosts, same with vehicles.  If you dislike certain aspects of the game, the workshop is your best friend and usually patches most of the problems you may have. While many vanillaists complain that the workshop shouldn't be responsible for 'fixing things the develeopers failed', they're not really patches or fixes but more so useful tweaks and additions. Do note that anything that add blocks or recipes to the game will break your character once uninstalled.  One thing i suggest is to disable vsync. Browse local files, go inside of the storage folder, in the file starbound.config, set it to false. It'll massively improve the FPS. There's definitly room for optimizations though (especially on windows).  Overall, i love this game. I've enjoyed playing it so far and I do hope the devs improve certain aspects of this game. Given that they have an unstable branch for testing the game, and the newest patch is alright so far. I'd if i were going off the negative reviews alone, they're slowly getting back on the right track.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"I liked this game back when it first came out on steam. When 1.0 came out, I figured I might enjoy it again. That wasn't the case. A lot of content was cut and even exploration feels much more bland and stale.   -Temperature system has been removed. This was one of the nice features back during the beta. Most clothing had function (Snow Infantry set was very useful) and it felt very relaxing sitting by a fire on a snow planet so you could warm up.  -Sectors have been removed. You used to only be limited in exploration by the temperature system and how warm or cool you could get. A forest planet in a sector would be just as dangerous as a lava planet on that same sector, and you would find the same resources on every planet in that sector until you moved on to the next one. This was a favorite feature of mine and really enhanced exploration because there was just as much incentive to going to the forest planet as the lava planet.   -Most techs are gone. I remember all the vehicle and flying techs, and how you'd have to find them to actually use them. Now that I can't use my bubble tech, I have to build giant pillars to get on avian pirate ships. And this isn't all, there was also a mech and some other vehicles. The only surviving tech vehicle is the boat, only now you have to waste pixels buying it instead of being incentivized to explore to find it.  -Randomly generated monsters and weapons have been removed. I enjoyed this because it added to exploration and had you wondering what kind of creatures and crazy weapons you'd find on a planet you'd land on. Every creature was unique and every weapon was unique, down to the name and function. This also added a lot of fun to exploration because of course, you wouldn't know what you're going to find.  -Story isn't that great. I honestly had more fun back when you'd build the bosses yourself in order to advance to the next sector and unlock more equipment and crafting tables. I thought the beginning of the story was fine, but the rest felt repetative and boring. 'Find a ________ settlement and scan objects' gets very annoying and I tend to just drift away from the story altogether. I have yet to face the final boss because of this.   -Plenty of weapons and armor have been cut, and I don't mean the randomized ones you used to find on planets. I mean weapons and armor you crafted at tables. Copper and gold almost seem to have no use anymore, and I quite enjoyed those armors, as bad as they were, and copper armor and weapons were easily obtained in the early game, allowing you to take on more dangerous things. It felt like I was legitimately getting stronger and every ore had a use. Almost any type of weapon could be made from any type of ore. Feel like making daggers? No problem. Spears? Yep. Instead now, there are too few craftable armors and weapons, and it seems ores have gotten even more scarce.  -Further cuts include certain dungeons (USCM bases are a prime example), and you can no longer attack NPCs unless you break all their stuff. If I want to be a murderous psychopath and purge xenos, just let me do it please. On top of all that, there's little reason to go to moons or asteroids anymore. Asteroids would be one of the most dangerous biomes in the game with the best resources, but now there's pretty much nothing.   I will repeat, I LOVED this game in 2013. Telling people to mod it in is no excuse and it's the wrong mentality to show to developers.    I'll change my opinion if some of the good features are added back into the game or some of the many promises Chucklefish made are implemented. Starbound simply feels like half the game it was when it first came out on Early Access.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Edit: Review Addendum for 1.0 release:  It's official, for their grand finale, Chucklefish has totally ruined Starbound.   They finally settled on one tedious game mechanic and a generic 'collect all the macguffins' plotline for the '1.0' release. Then they took all the hit or miss content they had tested and either vetted or removed over the last 3 years, carelessly ground it all up, and poured the resultant slop over the bland shitcake base game. Kinda like a chef who mulches an entire thanksgiving dinner into a soup, bones and all.  It seems like they couldn't decide how to properly implement all their old content in the face of the re-re-re-invented design, but rather than let it all go to waste, they just hastily rebranded and pasted bits of it everywhere. The slurry pulp that used to be sequential mission instances and technology unlocks is now an incomprehensible pile of broken gameplay chunks, haphazardly slapped everywhere without reason or direction.   The result is a horrible, disjointed, unplayable cluster♥♥♥♥ overflowing with inexplicable changes, even when it's NOT suffering from game-breaking slowdowns and fatal glitches. Unfortunately, this is the mess they've decided to settle on, so this is the mess we're stuck with. Even a dozen brilliant 3rd party user mods aimed at mitigating the damage aren't enough to salvage this disaster.   Good older content like the portable pixel printer are gone, while ridiculous, nonsensical additions were made, such as giant, unkillable ghosts that haunt every empty moon in the universe. Why??  In fact, that's the question that best sums up this entire 'official non-beta release.' WHY.  --Beta Version review follows:  I fear Starbound will turn out less like Disneyland, which is a functional masterpiece that will never be finished but constantly improved, and more like the Winchester House, constructed haphazardly and proceeding aimlessly without direction until its owner's death. The game has a more than decent framework, but the developers keep changing the game's premise, leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential.   It's gone from a Terraria-like 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses, to a story-driven series of instance dungeons, all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished (and/or unnecessary) features. This slash-and-burn development has left the game unfocused, long after the point where it should have been crystallizing. The initial hype has died down, releases are fewer and longer between, and content is stagnant for months at a time, leaving players wondering if there's any motivation or momentum left to see it completed.  The playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates, but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features, few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content. In their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game, they're offering a lot of gravy and not much meat.   Players will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment, leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests. Judging from the comments here and at other sites, many players have walked away due to the lack of content, and with them goes word-of-mouth support. After all, what good is an increasingly graphically refined game world if there's nothing new to do in it?",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"  I got 400+ hours out of a game I paid less than 15 dollars for, I've played it since Early Access, I have had my character wiped 4 times, If that is any indication on how long I've owned it. The game has a feel that not many other games have, the music is similar to the music of Morrowind, the weapons/combat remind me of Castlevania and the abilities are like the ones you get in Metroid or Mega Man. There is an endless galaxy to explore, a character to customize from various races, colonies to build, quests to complete, crops to grow, a ship to enhance and customize and monsters to capture. I think it is very worth the price. Oh, right. Hoverbikes.  Edit: I didn't receive the game for free, I have no idea why it says that or how to remove it.  Also, the modding community is extremely active and is on Steam Workshop/ Nexus Mods. I highly recommend Frackin' Universe and the XS Mech Mod. There are also mods that add in races and their communities/colonies which are really well done too.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Okay. We should be fair with Starbound. I will bs nobody. First off, I am a supporter from back when it was on Early Access. The game has been dramatically changed since then. I had to play through the whole game again, since my savegame was not compatible with V1 but who cares really?  So, what IS Starbound? Well it started as an open world sandbox game. KEEP THAT IN MIND PLEASE. So, since then a lot of stuff were added. We got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades, so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need. The game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions, to do some essential things. The whole tutorial is the lore of the game. Yup! A sandbox with lore as tutorial, how do you like that? One step before going against the final boss, you know you are ready to explore whatever you want. What a great idea! You also carry a codex, where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff, like journals, stories etc etc, very rewarding for readers. You can collect various stuff, like bugs, fish, fossils, and make collections out of them.  Randomly (?) generated quests occur all the time, with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff. Challenges are available and a lot of stuff to do.  You can farm, you can have your own pets... what else can I say about this awesome game?  Oh! The world! Well basically you start on a solar system. Then you go outside of it to another star. Stars are solar systems with planets inside them. Imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map. And believe me, there are LOTS of stars, full of planets to explore.  Favorite changes (for early access users that wanna see what's new): A] The pixel compressor has no penalty. B] The fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process. C] Optimized not to lag.   So let's see:  Graphics: 90% Fantastic pixel art  Sound: 90% Great music but too emotional for my taste. Still great. Gameplay: 90% It is very polished, the game seldom lags even on my old PC Replayability value: 90% With so many races, I bet this can be played many many times. Value for money: 90% I played 300 hours already, including the time before V1 was released. Scenario: 70% Interesting scenario, but that's it. &lt;&lt;&lt; This is considered an EXTRA on a sandbox game.  Do I recommend this? Well yes. It is a great game, just don't take it for an RPG. It is a sandbox.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"9/10  Starbound is a procedurally generated universe where you can plunder endless amounts of dungeons, build colonies, and mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It's a cute indie with co-operative multiplayer which makes up for its unassuming appearance with the sheer amount of content the developer provides, supports and continues to shell out.  Both the pixel art and soundtrack are both easy on your senses, creating an immersive atmosphere and inspiring ambience for late night galactic voyages.

211820,Starbound,"I'll be honest here, if you've never heard of starbound before, and you like the idea of a sci-fi sandbox survival-ish game, then you'll probably enjoy starbound. I however am giving this a thumbs down, for reasons I shall go into.  Long ago, in the early access days of starbound, players glimpsed what was a relatively complete game that was clearly a framework for something greater. Something complex. Hidden behind it's grid-based construction/mining engine was a surprisingly complex universe, complete with six unique races all of which had their own history, adversities, asthetic style and personality. For once it seemed like the character's species was actually going to matter, with even the descriptions of food items hinting that different species would have to eat different food, which is a very cool idea in a survival game. This type of complexity was, for me, what set starbound apart from other games in the genre, it wasn't just a sandbox, it was it's own world with conflicting cultures and people.  The earliest sign was that racial bonuses (abilities unique to what species your character was) was planned to be in the next update. These bonuses were later changed to be tied to the race's armoursets, where wearing the full set (head, torso, leggings) of a race's armour would confer it's bonus. This was apparently done for the sake of balance, and keeping each of the races equal. Sure, I thought, but to this day racial bonuses are still not part of the game.  Starbound's development has been slow. Very, very slow. I was ok with this, as it was the developer's first game, and after dabbling in game dev myself I am aware that it can be a very difficult thing to do. Things were fine at first, a slow creep of new assets and features, adding more content to the world's random-gen system, etc. Everything you'd expect from an early access title.  However, somewhere during development, something changed.  Everyone was hype for the next big update (as updates were incredibly rare) and it'd hit, sure there was all this cool new stuff they'd shown off in screenshots, but they would always come with a number of game-breaking bugs that would severely impact gameplay, and would sometimes take months to be fixed. But the most bizarre part to me was that CF would often just cut assets entirely from the game. Items, furniture, gone. no explanation given. Just gone, and for a game about exploration, collection and building, this seemed like a very odd move.  The last few updates leading up to 1.0 were the worst offenders at this. The previous diversity and characterisation of the game's six races were severely stripped away, racial weapons, and ship AI were removed for seemingly no reason, which is very strange considering the racial AI often featured in the game's devblog. This, along with the removal/altercation of several other features (the game's UI being one of them) pushed things over the line for me. I had hope, I had patience, but I look upon the finished product that is the 1.0 build currently on sale here and can't help but feel utterly disappointed.  In summary, what first appeared to be a surprisingly complex twist on the survival sandbox genre was dumbed down to rush it for release. Also, the game costs $5 less now. It's nice I paid extra to experience this disappointment.  There are actually a number of other issues I could go into as to why I'm giving this a thumbs down, from reckless spending to the developer's reaction to criticism, but this review is already long enough.  =================================================================  EDIT: Since everyone seems to comment on this. Yes, I have 1600+ hours played. This is because the early access builds had a launcher that was very easy to leave open for long periods of time, also I did actually enjoy playing the game, however, now that 1.0 has been released, many of the things I enjoyed about it have been removed, and I am doubtful they will ever be restored, hence my negative review.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I dig this game way way more than Terraria. There's just way more roleplaying potential to a game where you explore the endless Universe, as opposed to a game where you go right or left. I just want to manspread my Galactic Empire.  But fine i'll specify the finer points that tip the scales for me: - Artstyle is less chibi and more 'visible'. I know that sounds like not much of a differrence in a pixel game, but it's going to have a much bigger merit after hours of gameplay. - Size scaling. Everything in Starbound is visible and more up close, whereas Terraria seems 'tiny' with a lot of 'wasted' space. I don't know if Terra scales with monitors, but either way. - The flashlight. Sounds silly, but it makes exploring caves in Starbound much more fun. You no longer have to spend most of earlygame on putting torches around. - Varied races, but that's a given. - Varied worlds, but that's a given. - The main building tool in Starbound is much more convenient and versatile. But that might be a negative point for people who prefer heavier roleplaying. - Workshop - Weapons and animations are much better in my opinion. There is absolutely no stiffness to attacks. - Building is much better as well, you can freely choose between using the same material for either the foreground or the background. Not only more realistic, but more convenient as well. - The Starship HUB.  Look at that. Points.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"It is a very sad day indeed when the people that play a game know more about what makes it fun than the people that made it. I have played Starbound from the very beginning, before it was an early access game on Steam. It was awesome! The things they had planned for this game, the things they had already available for this game was very exiting indeed. Every time you went to a planet, you got a different palette of trees, rocks, soil, water, monsters and food! They had the promise of different abilities for each race. At the very beginning they had a system where you had to build a fire to keep warm until you could muster enough resources to make yourself warm clothes!!! Then the combat update came! The game they where designing then was very promising indeed.  Sadly most of this stuff has been taken out. Along the way they lost the vision of the game they had and 1.0 is what we got. A very boring and empty game. What the devs fail to understand is that the community was playing the last stable update, and loving it, look at the ratings! All I wanted was a sort of story and lore to be created for the universe I was playing in and that would of been awesome! But instead I got 1.0, a shallow, stripped down version of a game that I was promised. To top it off, it’s full of awful bugs and optimization problems! It’s funny when you think about it, the beta was more stable and more optimized. I wish I could uninstall 1.0 and go back to the last stable version, I had more toys to play with in that version. My sensei once told me that to be successful you need a posture in life. When you do something, you have to believe in what your doing and stand by it, even when the waters come rushing against it and try to bring it down. They should of kept their initial vision, the game would have been a lot better. I can’t recommend this title in it’s current state. I’m happy that you sold over 60 000 copies since 1.0’s release guys, but once the community has a taste of what they bought, I don’t think your gonna sell much more, just look at the new reviews coming in.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"A lot of people have been saying this game is like Terraria. Now, I'd like to clear up the misunderstanding here.  Yes, maybe with some features, gameplay, pixel style and 2-D side scroller, it is like terria. But other than that, it doesn't FEEL like Terraria at all. In fact, it's better.  Terarria fails to capture the subtle beauty of Starbound, with it's amazing sounndtract and the wonderlust that we all have for space. It's simplistic at first glance, but dives much deeper than you'd think.  It has a story ark for those who like set missions and goals, and a certain path they have to follow. Explorations dominates the game, and the world of Starbound is ridden with lore. Each race is whimsical in nature, from robots being the ones the least technilogically advanced, and flower-people being the most carnivorous and ficious species alive. For those who like to let creativity soar, you can build whatvever your heart desires. From tall futuristic buildings scraping the sky, to a small wooden cavern laying behind a line of trees.  And the best of all, if you'd just like to relax, you can always just grab your handy dandy manupilator module and chop some logs, or go mining and listen to the tic-tic-tic of ores ppopping out of foreground and background alike. Chill with some friends around a campfire jamming out to 12 days of christmas on your various instruments, or team up to find legendary (and curiously awesome and even more awesomely named) weopons, and battle tiny penguins who got their flippers on asault rifles and tanks.  I don't think Starbound strives to be a spesific game. It doesn't strive to have an ending either. Not being able to call it quite a sandbox, I'll call it an adventure you have to play, and experiance for yourself. I can never tire of this game, and doubt I ever will. Billions of unique planets, creatures, species and collectables hover at your fingertips. All you have to do is try not to think about scary purple ghosts as you get the fuel to power your spaceship, and explores stars across the galaxy ;)  Starbound is such an unique game, putting it into words is both a challenge, and an impossible feat I have attempted and failed. Just know that it is worth every penny and far more, and that it is, and always will be, one of my very favourite games.  ~Toodles, 2D-Bunnie",1,1

I have spent hours and hours amassing materials and creating multi-tier gardens with glowing glass walls, so I could plant and harvest day and night. I've fought cultists and abominations, post-apocalyptic survivalists and primatives, and every other thing inbetween. I've committed village massacres and protected stoic swamp-dwelling frogmen.

211820,Starbound,"100% Recommend this game. You'll see as of the official 1.0 release, the majority of reviews are negative. I respectfully disagree with them. Did the devs make some shortsighted decisions while pushing the official release? They sure did. Are there things that used to be in the game that have been removed? Well yeah, you bet. Are there new mechanics that seem tedious and hold back the player, simple for the sake of holding back the player? Pretty much.  But guess what? This game is still. Not. Finished.  The 1.0 release isn't 'The End' of Starbound, these devs have been with us since day one, the game has always been fun and has always been changing. Sometimes things get nerfed into oblivion, sometimes things are game-breakingly strong. It's a delicate task to balance something with so much content! AND THEY AREN'T DONE!   I have faith that this game will only continue to improve, at WORST this is a rough patch and in no way do the devs deserve the amount of flak they have received these past few days. If you're a little worried about purchasing this game right now, then hold off until it's on sale or until the majority of recent reviews are positive - it's your call. But don't let all the nay-sayers scare you away, this game is phenomenal and provides many MANY hours of fun.   I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this review but this is just the way I see it. I love Starbound through thick and thin, and I am deeply saddened that so many people turn their backs on it after being loyal for so long.

211820,Starbound,"It's hard to say which one is better as Terraria and Starbound both play out very different from one another. Guess it comes down to your personal preference and what you expect from them.  Personally I favor Starbound over Terraria. To me Terraria is all about fighting hoards of monsters and bosses while farming rare drops almost mmorpg style. There's little to no story at all and the world itself is very boring. And for a game that mostly takes place underground, mining and exploration is very tedious and unrewarding.   This is where the major differences lie with Starbound. It offers a huge galaxy populated with different races and animals with a good amount of lore behind them. There's everything from underwater metropolises to small farming villages, ruins of forgotten civilizations, creepy dungeons and hightec research labs. All this combined with a short story and some beautifully hand crafted missions make Starbound a really interesting world to explore.  Starbound also allows for very different playstyles and almost everything is optional in order to progress. You can build villages or huge farms, explore for resources or mine them, become self sufficient or survive by trade, do quests and gather a crew or roll as a lone wolf.. Or maybe you just wanna kill, pillage and plunder everything in your path. All valid options in order to survive.  That said, combat is not as streamlined as in Terraria and is more a part of a whole, rather than the main focus. Building, farming crops, questing and exploring is as much a part of Starbound as combat is. So if your looking for a similar hack'n'slash combat focused experience, then you'll be disappointed and proberly find the game lacking.  Now don't get me wrong, combat in Starbound ain't bad. It's just different. And wide variety of awesome and crazy weapons helps to make it interesting. There's swords, spears, hammers, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, 'nade launches, flamethrowes, rocket launchers, weird alien tec etc etc.. You can even dual wield a large variety of weapons in any way you see fit. Only thing I personally don't like is a specific class of some voodoo sci-fi psi-ops elementalist magic bull that doesn't really seem to fit into the game. But I digress..  Starbound is a game suited for people that like to build, explore and create their own little adventures. If you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer, then you'll get a plesant and enjoyable experience.  Closing argument and metaphor.. If Terraria is like a lego technic set, where you have to follow a specific schematic in order to achieve your goal. Then Starbound is a huge box of random lego blocks that requires you to use your imagination to reach it instead.",1,1

But if you're really new to Starbound, why should you care? You weren't there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow, when the koalas were furious, and when everything was all cream and gravy.  I'm not going to lie, I'm an old person too. I miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you.  I miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades.  I miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items.  I miss my bubble tech and my old characters.  I miss when the toolbar only had one L and one R.  But that's for the old people to mope about. Sure, I miss it, but that time has passed long ago. New things await ahead, and I can't complain about that. It'll never be Old Starbound, but it'll always be Starbound to me.  I think if you started here, you'd find something you would enjoy. You wouldn't be dragged down by the good ol' days.

Why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself?  Go out there and explore Starbound. You might find something you could never imagine.    There's also a race of Harambes. You can explore galaxies without pants. You can slaughter innocent people of towns you find. You can kill your friends. You can play pokemon and enslave small creatures. You can be a weeaboo fish man. You can get anime blades. You can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to 'ice' people. (BAHAHAHAHAHA) You can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you don't need.       YOU CAN EVEN BE A PRO GENJI LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF WITH MODS TOO HOLY ♥♥♥♥ JUST GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  ",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Ironicly enough, The Developers play in trashcans.  EDIT:  Since My time playing it from 3 or so years ago it hasn't changed much, A half baked story, Same-y and bland planets, and boring quests, its all the same. The developers are incompetent and couldn't program a toaster without throwing out all the code 3 times.  Notice how the changelog looks very impressive, but if you take a second and look at it no real gameplay has been added. Terraria is a much more compelling and rich experience and that game didn't need a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars. A possible Alternative to starbound is to slam your head against a wall while playing terraria, The best part about that is when (If) your concussion heals you will have an actually good game to play.  An Entire Universe to explore, and yet every single planet feels the same. Water, Water, Everywhere, And yet not a drop to drink.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Developers fail to complete the basic tasks of beta process, let alone putting out a good game. Save your money, or spend it on Terrarria. Now that starbound is 1.0 I gladly say what garbage this game is. Save your money for Otherworld. And the 250 hours was helping beta, sad my long suffering did not pay off.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I bought this game when it was originally released on Steam. I gave it some time, and understood that being Early Access it would feel incomplete. I'm no programmer, never done anything of this sort, but after 11 months I was expecting a lot more content and polish. I might recommend this game eventually, but based on the progress they've been making that may not be until next decade.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"This game is essentially a really cool lego set with a rather poor story and some cool dungeons which you need to grind boring crap for hours to actually do.   Many of the items that actually made it into the game are useless... Hoverbikes are practical, but awful.  Boats.... why would you ever want one? There don't appear to be any oceans to traverse other than the ones on ocean planets. And on those everything worthwhile is underwater. By the time you can afford either you'll probably be sick of the game. Farming is too tedious and nothing can be automated. There's a cool wiring system, but not a lot useful you can actually do with it.  Colonies are simply player made sources of the same crappy fetch and escort quests that non-player villages can do. Colonists won't farm for you. Your crew are more of a pain than a help and will constantly block crafting stations.   This looks like an excellent game engine upon which a great game could be made using mods; but by itself it really isn't a great game. It's certainly not what we were sold in the kickstarter nor does it live up to the promise of what was in beta.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I have to say, I'm amazed with Starbound.  I bought it some years ago just out of duty because I started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere. Let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time Chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game, which are two major points that would drive me towards a game, but I'm a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like. The art was great, but the game heavily lacked direction, feeling a lot like a sci-fi terraria, hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet, built a nice house, and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons. I was not impressed.  Recently I decided to give it a try if anything because I owned the game and hadn't taken a look at it since two years ago. And honestly, the game is great now. Not only there's a story, but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character, tech to unlock, and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward.  The art is gorgeous, and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokémon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun. The survival elements are back and although I can see why they took them out of the game, feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving (there's food everywhere and you'll have no problem staying fed), the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole you'll see.  The objectives are distinct, and the exploration is tense since you'll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items. A lot of the equipment you'll find is more aesthetic than anything, and weapons are kinda meh, but it's super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works. Action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars, making the overall hotkey capacity alright. The techs are fun and meaningful, getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration, and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time.  The only problems I really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me, like for instance when jumping down a platform you'll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the 'down' button, making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself, or that double tapping in a direction can trigger Dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise. Sometimes you'll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios, but taking it slowly will help with that so it's not too bad.  Overall though, I think it's a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its SEA phase. The sense of progression is tangible, the settlements are fun, the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes. From an aimless Terraria in space to a proper metroidvania, Starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library.  9/10.",1,1
211820,Starbound,Played for 5 minutes Already more content than No Man Sky,1,1
211820,Starbound,"The release of 1.0 has been met with both negative and positive responses; largely negative, as early-access players feel that the game lacks some of the content that previous builds promised. And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment. Prior to 1.0, Chucklefish presented us with mechanics like racially exclusive weaponry, temperature variants and even space stations. There was a lot of great content that has since been removed.  However, the game still has the potential to change, something that a lot of people fail to recognise.   PROS: - Visually speaking, this is one of the nicest looking pixel platformers I've ever seen.  - The crafting system is rich and complex, but does take getting used to. You now have the ability to upgrade your crafting stations instead of building newer models. The scan function on your M.M now means you can craft any item you've scanned prior, which is handy.  - Each species gets its own unique ship, armour sets, dialogue and lore (with the exception of the Novakid. Seriously. Where are my Novakid towns, Chucklefish?) - There is a lot to explore, both above and below ground. No two planets are alike.  - If you have the incentive, building houses and buildings is a fun and rewarding experience. You can even summon settlers to occupy your builds for you.  CONS: - The new HUD and item bar are difficult to use and look ugly. The old one worked fine, and wasn’t in need of a makeover.  - Combat swings between being enjoyable and insufferable. The ‘damage on contact’ system is stupid, especially when coupled with the number of monsters that spawn; I’ve had ten of the things on screen, and died because of lag because I was crushed in the middle. - Five years and there’s still no ‘store all’ option for item containers.  - The story is weak, flimsy and repetitive.   As a sandbox survival game, Starbound is brilliant. There is a lot to see, millions of planets to explore and a great deal of depth to building and creating, as well as the reintroduced hunger mechanic.  As an action game, however, Starbound falls short. Combat is weak and laggy (the game has trouble running when there’s a lot on screen) and the story falls flat.   Personally, I love this game; I love it because building and creating and exploring is something I enjoy. I’m quite happy to spend an hour or two gathering materials to customise my ship or house with. However, this isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a more balanced experience regarding combat and plot, then there are other games which are much better suited!",1,1
211820,Starbound,"So I see a lot of bad reviews since the new 1.0 patch. I get people are upset that things got wiped and things have changed. People must also remember that these games go through massive changes to make the game more polished and run/ work better. With that being said here is my review as a new player so far.   I love everything this game has offered since the splash screen. My friend and I have completely lost all sense of time and direction while playing this(both of us came from terraria). Amazing soundtrack, gameplay, art style(yes I know it's old school but it's still pretty), crafting system(huge and tons of variation), weapons, clothing/armor. I could go on about all the great things we have seen in just the few hours we have played. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Terraria. I fought a penguin flying an UFO. Soooo yea play it and I promise you won't be let down if you are new to the title. A lot of the older players from early access(or w/e it's called) don't like some of the changes but coming in new you won't know those changes and it won't matter purely because the game is fresh to you. Do yourself a favor and try it.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"As someone with a substantial amount of playtime and experience in this, it's morbidly entertaining to watch this get/have gotten progressively worse with each update.      EDIT: Starbound 1.0 is out! Come back and do all the fetch quests all over again! This time there's removed content and still a large disparity in balance. There have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3D printer now, but they're immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to (nearly) max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3D printed furniture.  All variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now. The arid, deserted, ded landscape that was Starbound's 'endgame' is now slightly more decorated, but to compensate, all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be! Hooray!  Oh and don't consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working, the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what I mean.",-1,1

It starts great, but that ending, shorter than Rage.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Game is finally out... but it seems to be rushed and incomplete.  version 1.0 is extremely poorly optimized. Game drops to 15 fps and fluctuates wildly depending on your environment. An RX480 is just as good as a laptop GPU.  Crafting wise, it seems to have a lot of ornamental things, but actual useful items... not that many. In some 12-15 hours you can upgrade everything you need, leaving you only to follow the main quest.  NPC sidequests are rather stupid, take note/resources to some other NPC nearby (if you're lucky) or go to some area in the world and get some NPC back to town. Not sure why they thought ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO type quests will be fun.  Given how long it took for the developers to actually release the game, justifying it as 'we don't want to rush it, we want the game to be great, we don't want to offer a half baked experience', I can't help but think that chuckle when the game starts is a sort of ' you idiots paid us 3 years ago for this game, bet you feel smart now'.  Very disappointed by what the game delivered vs what it promised (to be honest, I might have gone past the content if the game wasn't performing so awful).",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"First, I recommend checking out Tystarchius' review here, since my thoughts are basically a continuation and elaboration:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/tystarchius/recommended/211820   Like him, I wish there was a third 'neutral' option: I can't recommend the game in its current state, but that doesn't make it necessarily a *bad* game. I want to be able to come back to this review in a year and just replace the whole thing with 'edit: nvm'. As it stands, however, there are simply too many flawed design decisions and silly/stupid mechanical mistakes to enjoy it.  There are numerous small missteps, so I'm going to just go for the big ones here:   * The gameplay loop is broken.  Quick definition: Gameplay loops describe the core set of repetitive actions that make a game fun, and are composed of multiple disparate elements. For example, in Doom, you're not JUST shooting monsters; you're also searching for secrets, which lead to treasure, which enhances your ability to shoot more monsters. Stardew Valley has a half-dozen systems that interweave - farming, fighting, socializing - that all positively influence and enhance one another; any given activity provides benefits to other activities, meaning time is never wasted and you're always making progress.  In Starbound, this loop is broken, as all of the various systems are disconnected. You can complete the game without ever creating a single settlement, planting a single seed, or taking a single randomly-generated mission to gain a crew member. For some reason, Chucklefish thought this was a *selling point* instead of a massive design failure. Being able to skip entire elements, systems and game mechanics is not good game design! Not only that, but these extra systems are completely superfluous, as they are *less efficient* than the core element of planet exploration. You can just run around collecting the resources, which is usually a much faster method than farming or questing.  The point of a gameplay loop is to give the players a break and let them focus on other activities before returning to the main progression. This keeps the game fresh longer and prevents burnout/fatigue, which is incredibly important in long-running games like this. Terraria's gameplay loop balanced this well: exploring (fighting, looting, digging) would lead naturally to the other elements, like farming (critically important buffs from potions) and building (new NPCs at a steady rate need housing), without forcing you to dump more time than strictly necessary if you didn't want to get fancy.  * The survival mechanics aren't fun.  First, hunger. This mechanic has never been fun for me, and its implementation in Starbound is no different. 'Use a consumable item every X minutes/hours' is just an annoyance. Fortunately, food is generally abundant (defeating the whole purpose of the mechanic...), but more importantly, more complex and rare foods give you a ton of bonuses, which is pretty fun.  However, the Environmental Protection Pack as a gate to planetary exploration is incredibly lazy. It's just an armor slot that unlocks a few more biomes at a time, which are all coincidentally around specific stars. There's nothing interesting about it, just 'oh, I can go to a jungle planet now, which was apparently radioactive before'. This is likely to make each new biome feel exciting and fresh, but instead it just makes them feel uninteresting. This is exacerbated by the fact most mini-biome and 'dungeons' (including villages) can appear in *any* biome, leading to Floran villages perched between volcanoes, Avian villages set in frozen wastelands, and beautiful flower gardens springing up on eternally dark horror-planets.  Speaking of randomization:  * The procedural generation is lackluster.  This is a doozy. I will grant that the planet terrain generation has improved *significantly* over the years since the first playable alpha, but it's still not as robust or interesting as Terraria's. Granted, Terraria has a few years' head start on Starbound, but it still needs a lot more work to be competitive.  My main gripe is that all of the 'dungeon' spawns are literally identical, down to creature spawns, aesthetic decorations, and even treasure loot tables. (I once found two underground abandoned Glitch dungeons with an EPP mod in the exact same 'random' corner box.) This means that if you've seen one Hylotl town or Apex resistance base, you've literally seen all of them. There's no mystery or excitement; it's just 'oh, these guys again'. This is pretty much inexcusable, given the game prides itself on randomization and the nature of these changes are trivial. The game generates entire planets! Why are all the dungeons wholly static?! If you need some suggestions, Spelunky released an interactive tutorial that explains how their rooms are put together! Why is this a problem for Starbound?!  * Progression and solar systems are goofy.  As mentioned above, the EPP is a silly, lazy content gate to different solar systems. I should be able to see icy planets toward the outer edge of a system while those toward the center are hot, and find a mixture of biomes and challenges across them for me to discover if I can or can't handle on my own. Just a handwavey 'yeah you're good bro' to the next color of star is boring.  This also means the planets all feel samey, with some different art assets but the same gameplay. There's no difference between mining on a volcanic planet or a frozen planet, other than getting down from the surface initially. The progression of armor tiers is just basic stat increases, with a very uninspired range/damage/defense decision in endgame. It's the same process to collect ores from every planet with no differences in threat or difficulty once you've reached the appropriate gear tier. It's almost a microcosm of the game itself: dig past the shallow surface and underneath it's the same, over and over again, until you win or get bored.  This is where the survival elements could tie in with the colony system, had you any reason to build one. Except colonists don't care if they're on a lava planet or tropical paradise; their quests don't change, they don't ask for structural protections from the elements or anything, they just stand around like every other NPC villager and do little cute things until they're either attacked or have a quest for you. No 'build a weather machine' or 'help us set up a farm, but the soil sucks because it's a toxic planet', just 'Billy got lost' or 'there's a bunch of cultists out by that random lawn chair, can you go investigate?'   This review has rambled on long enough, so I'm going to end it here. I critique because I care; I *want* Starbound to succeed and get better, and the only way to do that is to complain - at length - about the numerous problems in hopes someone notices and starts to fix it. Mods will help in the future, but right now there aren't any to address the deep and jarring issues with the base systems themselves. Maybe in a year, it'll be finally finished, but right now...  tl;dr pls make game better tia",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I've waited 4 years for this game to come out.  I was really devastated to find out they succumbed and released it out into the Early-Access, because it was around the time when Early-Access was getting a lot of love, and only so much hate. This was before stuff like Towns development stopped and stuff, people didn't yet see the trouble in it all.  Well, it came out there, and I played it, along with others. I walked around, I killed things, I did the lame penguin boss fights. I was unimpressed - Rightly so I would think, it's not fully developed yet, it's not released, I couldn't judge it well in it's state. I noticed things were getting added by community requests, and this is where I started to shy away from it, I didn't want to see what was gonna be one of my dream games, altered and messed around with by the community - for good or worse.  So I ignore the dev blog from there on out, and waited my extra, I guess two years.  Lo and behold, right there on Steam, it's out. Let's give this a proper go.  (ignore 30 hours of gameplay, that was with the betas, my actual playtime is no more than 17 hours, also, Steam didn't have enough space for my full review, I trimmed where I could)  The intro to the game is very slow and sluggish, it gives you the basic tools you need to get started, and you start mining away at the surface for goodies and oddities, pretty classic compared to another game of this genre.  I amassed my metals and my tools, made myself new weapons and armors, and got to more killing. Then your first real quest is to go really deep into the planet, get a certain type of material, and teleport to the 'hub' of the game. Well god damn if that didn't take me forever, it didn't feel that exciting.  After you find out about the hub, you find out you have to mine moons for fuel to jump to new planets out of your reach. Might sound cool at first, but it gets annoying very fast.  You tend to hop planet to planet mining the next tier of resources, and making stuff, but within this whole mess, you have to go around to certain planets, and find each of the six races and their civilizations, and go into SCAN mode, and start clicking around for green highlighted objects, and talk to people, to learn more about them, and eventually get the next Mission to go on.  The Missions are like adventure instances, a pre-made map with an objective and puzzles with monsters all over the place. They're fun, but after you do a few of em, you just want it to stop. They lose their interest quickly, when the bosses later turn into bullet sponges, few of them are unique with cool fights.  The main storyline itself just felt, too forced. I thought this was sort of a primarily exploration and sandbox based game. Well, multiple aspects and shops etc. are blocked from you, until you progress enough in the storyline, so it feels forced and boring right off the bat. Normally to me, this would have been fine, but this felt unnecessary and everything else just gets flat because of it.  (It gets really annoying trying to find the proper planets to just scan some more and more)  Onto the gameplay aspects and mechanics, progression in the game is done by crafting. You craft the first tier of armor and weapons, and then you tend to go find new, randomly generated weapons to kick ♥♥♥ with, and crafting new toolbenches and armor to go along with the new materials.  It's a little sad, being that making your own weapons is a waste of time, because all the strong - and unique - ones are all out there in the universe, not on your crafting screen. There's only a few tiers of actual equipment as well, it's very short lived. By 8 hours into the game I had already acquired what seemed to be the best armor out of the materials you find in the game.  Onto the UI of the game, it's just, annoying. I don't feel like it's presented very well, it could have been much cleaner. Opening your inventory always gave me a headache, as it opens right in the damn middle of your screen, blocking your character and things around them. You can move it around thankfully, but it doesn't maintain that position the next time you open it, so it's just a constant struggle trying to open it up in the field. There's a sort function for it thankfully, but not for chests, which gets very annoying, because there's simply so much ♥♥♥♥ you pick up in the game, that you need to constantly reorganize it all if you're picking it all up. With chests not being able to be sorted, it just causes you a whole hour of frustration, trying to reorganize it all.  The difficulty of the game is modest. When you make your character, you have the choice of Casual, Survival or Hardcore. Casual has no real penalties for dying, you only drop a small percentage of pixels, and you can just walk on back and get right back to it. Survival seems to be the 'normal' difficulty, you need to eat to survive, you drop certain items on death, and you drop more pixels. Hardcore is Survival, included that, when you die once, you're dead forever.  In the end, I honestly just felt stupid for playing Survival, my other friends just chose casual because, having to keep up with food all the time just sounded like an annoying chore. It really was. I would constantly just be chowing down whatever I found to keep my meter happy, and the drop items on death penalty just made it all the while more boring.  There's a lot of other little attractions here and there, you can own a farm, and make shipments (homage to Harvest Moon I would assume), there's a Pokemonlike capturing system for pets. Upgrades to your ship along with crew. Vehicles to ride around in (though, no promised mech sadly), little challenge rooms out in the world. They're neat, though ultimately, I never gave em a chance. I got my hotrod and rode around and that was that.  Sadly, there's a lot of bugs in the game, more than I was betting on. Food sometimes became infinite, planets generated too slowly for me to traverse, and I've had the game crash on me and freeze several times when I'm just moving about. The FPS however, takes the cake. It would CONSTANTLY keep dropping and screwing up, I looked around and tried the fixes people suggested, and to no avail, and I typically don't have technical issues with games on my end, so this was a huge concern of mine.  Dropping to 30 frames when just walking around, really sucks.  Graphicly/Aesthetically, it's awesome, and the soundtrack is amazing along with it. Good listening in and out of game.  All in all, at the end of the day, the game feels like it's just a bit of a repetitve cycle with no clear reward at the end. Hop from planet to planet, hoping to find something cool next time, and get annoyed that you have to keep mining fuel to continue on. I beat the game, and it just didn't feel satisfying in the least.  I've felt like I haven't covered enough about the game, but at the same time, I can feel (and see) that I've written too much already.  I don't feel like this game is a worthy spirtual successor to Terraria, as some would like to claim. I had that notion back when it was in development, but no more. I just see this as another blotch on my game list that I want removed. If you read through and at one point just said 'but there's a mod for X' or 'wait for an update'. Then no, and no.  The player shouldn't have to resort to mods to fix an issue, and I've done plenty of waiting, I thought one of the points of the beta was so they COULD fix things, and polish it all up. Sadly, it still feels quite raw and buggy, and just not worth my investment. I don't  want to wait around longer for things to get better - That was suppose to be now.  I dunno if the wait was really worth it is what I'm getting at.   tl;dr This is a one way trip out into space. Wether you want to stay up there, or land somewhere else, well, you might get displeased either way.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"Played this game all the way from its inception and I have to say I am dissapointed with the final product in relation to the time they spent on it.  The problems are not with what the game is, it is a good game. It is what it could have been and to me the final execution feels rushed. So many reworks, I think they tried to achieve perfection and got tired with it and in the end released a ill thought out rushed game. Ok here are my main problems.  The questline and story they added is terrible  The main questline features a few basic starter tutorial like missions to get you into the game and then basically has you repeat the exact same quest 6 times before facing a final boss. It is always worrying when the tutorial missions are more interesting and fun to play then any other part of the game. It is also so crazy short. I completed the game in 2 days with little effort which links in to my second issue.  It is very easy  This is basically down to progression not being linked to the questline. Once your out of the starter missions and you have repaired your ship, you can basically get a a top tier weapon and armor before actually doing any of the main questline. Progression in starbound is not bound to the questline or story. I think this was a design flaw. Sure you can just pace it yourself, but the even bigger issue is this my next point.  You can basically mine everything you need to progress to the next tech tier in one mining run  So for example, when I unlocked tech to let me visit the fiery or frozen stars, basically the stars that had everything but the final ore, I was able to mine enough of every single resource needed to completely max my tech out in one trip. I was able to get enough materials to get all three of the end game armor sets and crafting stations. From one run. Then when you unlock the final planet ore, again one run gives you all the solarium you need to finally max out your armor and anything else you need. Thats it game is pretty much done. You should have a god like weapon by now as they can literally spawn in the most basic of chests anywhere in the game. So if you havent already beaten all the bosses, go and jump about spamming fire and complete them. Thats pretty much it which leads me to my next issue.  I dont see any reason to play on once completed  You may differ with me in opinion here, but I really couldnt see any point in going back to play any more. I mean the fun is in looting and exploring right? So once you have unlocked the hardest difficulty planet there is no point in going to any others as the reward is worthless to you at this point. The side missions and 'town/villages' they implemented with npc missions are utterly pointless. Very low reward for doing repitive tedious missions. So basically 90% of the games worlds are no longer worth visiting at this point. You already have godlike everything which you found in the first chest you encountered on one of these planets. What is the point? I really hope I am missing something here but this was my experience of it. Sure you can max your ship out, sure you can try to build a colony, it all just feels shallow and completely pointless. Like features people wanted which they just added without any thought in relating it to the rest of the gameplay.  I played terraria for weeks and actually found bits of it tough, I dont think I ever saw everything and the final boss was difficult for me and took me quite a few attempts.  I honestly finished starbounds final release in two days and never really had any problems dying.  What could they have done?  Make looting make sense. So rubbish loot on the surface, better loot for quest rewards, more rare items the deeper you go etc.   Make an end game where early game planets are still relevant.  Make other game features like ship and colony building relevant and necessary for the main game questline.  Actually have a decent questline with variation in missions and a lot, lot, lot more of them.  Increase overall difficulty of pretty much everything.  The final 4 tiers of ore are basically split on 2 tiers, 3 of them having equal weighting on a lower tier and then one final ore which lets you upgrade each of these 3 tiers to a final tier (we are talking armor and weaponry here). This was a clear of sign of rushing to me. These should have been four seperate upgrades instead of two.   And so much more I could write all night but I am not going to.  I have to ask myself, what did they spend well over a year on? I played ti with my friend before and we actually spent a good week on it and I remember having a lot of fun. There were not any quests and maybe one or two bosses I cannot remember, but the progression made more sense and the game was tougher. I remember actually struggling against mobs at points, we actually had to do the old build a wall around us with a peep hole to shoot out of trick to actually get through some of the tougher areas. Loot made sense as well, like it was actually worth exploring and looting stuff.   What happened guys? I thought this was gonna be the game that kept me amused for months when it was completed.  I could have beat ruin with my eyes closed.  TL:DR In summary this is a fun game and an enjoyable experience, its just too easy, too short with a lot of worthless features adding nothing to gameplay and most damaging for it it has no replay value at all once you have beaten all the bosses as the game design makes 90% of the game worthless after this point.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Since this game attracts the Terraria crowd, here's a review about what you should expect out of this game compared to Terraria. For starters, Starbound is kind of like Terraria on steroids - it's bigger, far more involved (it actually has a quest component to it) and it's way harder.  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Gameplay Differences   Even on the easiest setting, Starbound plays like Terraria Hardmode from the very beginning. There's a difference between 'hard' and 'obnoxious', though, and in my opinion, this game is in the 'hard' category. You'll have to get on your feet and learn how things work, but thankfully, this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time. You really appreciate every item you find, because you're going to be very weak for a long time in the beginning, and your first desire will be to get rid of that crappy starter weapon.   If you've already played Terraria, you'll know how to jump right in to Starbound. The game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining, taking items, building houses and fighting enemies. It's bascially 'another take on Terraria,' as you'll see very quickly. Terraria's controls are simply better - jumping and curving in mid-air to reach a narrow platform is frustrating in this game, and you'll have to get used to how its 'gravity' works, as it is far more unforgiving. Couple that with the fact that you'll get seriously hurt (or killed) from falling.  Starbound has a bigger emphasis on food than Terraria. Food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in Terraria (except for pumpkin pies), but it is a necessity here -- especially on the harder tier, where you'll starve to death...this doesn't happen in the easiest mode, though. You'll start off finding and knowing about basic food, but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items. Food not only increases health, but gives perks and stat boosts as well. Even on the easiest setting, food rots if you hold on to it for too long.   +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Combat  Combat is highly simplistic in Starbound, it is nothing more than hack &amp; slash for the most part. Some monsters attack by nature, some don't, but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked, making combat predictable in this game.   Unlike Terraria, you'll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly and not far after getting started, rather than in Terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain NPCs. For the most part - one handed swords swing quicky and allow you to use a shield in the other hand, but they are weak and will require many 'hits' to kill an enemy. Two-handed swords are slow, but do far more damange than a one-handed. Other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse, and release to swing. Guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down, but will allow you to do it from a safe distance. In the beginning, you'll want to stay far, far away from any enemy that has a gun - especially if it's a sniper rifle.  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Look &amp; Feel  Starbound has the look and feel of an early 90s PC or SNES game, kind of like something made by Ocean or Sierra, as opposed to Terraria's more pixellated NES feel. Starbound's music is more predictable and uniform - lots of quiet, soothing piano music.   Starbound's 'monsters' look like Pokemon rejects, which kind of gave the game its own characteristic. I personally like the huge range, style and diversity of Terraria's creatures way more. Landscapes are far more detailed then Terraria, especially backdrops, trees and other elements. Trees fall sideways when cut, and you'll be surprised when you see your first landslide when you're mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime. This game has the same 'biome' style regions as Terraria, where you'll venture from a forest to a jungle, or from a cavern to a slime pit, and eventually down to magma. From experience, it looks like digging too far down will result in an long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava - be careful when you're digging a Starbound 'hellevator' as you won't get the same results as you did in Terraria...  Terraria's building mechanic is more involved and intricate than Starbound for the simple reason of hammers: they allowed you to hit blocks into 'angles' and make tons of different and unique designs, corners and slopes in Terraria. No such thing exists in Starbound, where you can only place items in square blocks. However, Starbound's graphics are more detailed and beautiful, and you'll still be able to create great looking structures. There's no 'corruption' or 'crimson' style event that you'll have to worry about in Starbound, so, create what you want and don't worry about what will happen to it mid-way through the game.  For the most part, you take take or steal almost everything you see in Starbound, just like you can in Terraria, except on missions (for example, your first real mission, The Outpost, where all of the chairs/beds/consoles/etc are locked down and immobile). For items that you can't craft, you may come across blueprints which are one-use items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables, one you have the necessary tool to do so.  When it comes to crafting, everything works pretty much the same between the two games. Craft a workbench-style item and it will allow you to create new items. In Starbound, you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items. You'll find that in order to do this, better ore from outside your solar system is necessary.  Negatives: you can't pause the game (WHY?!)  +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: My Favorite Things  There are a few things that set Starbound from Terraria in my mind - the game's universe seems bigger and more 'involved,' because it simply is...you're no longer standed on a single game world of small/medium/large that's created from the main menu, but an entire 'universe' is created for you when you first start a Starbound quest. You'll get your own space ship, which can be decorated like a house, and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel. To see how big the game world is, zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them. It's an exciting thing to figure out on your first playthrough.  The game has objectives and a questline for you to go through, which makes the game interesting rather than Terraria's 'grind and get more powerful', which becomes stale through time. While there are plenty of boilerplate 'fetch' quests in Starbound, they'll force you to check out locations you haven't seen yet.   I actually like the increase in difficulty that Starbound has vs. Terraria - it's easy to adjust to, and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more. Getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game, since they are far more difficult to find than in Terraria, and random chests don't usually mean uber weapons are in them...but, mediocre ones, or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing, but worse at another (damage vs. speed). You won't be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile - at least, until you get the courage to leave the solar system - so, you'll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts.  Overall, if you loved Terraria but got tired of it, you won't want to miss this one - it's a bigger 'take' on Terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting.",1,0
211820,Starbound,"Hi guys! HappyDays here looking at Starbound 1.0!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEC8pGTuwX0   Having played Starbound prior to the full release I was excited to see what the developers had changed moving in to a full version 1.0 release.  Initial impressions seem positive, movement and combat seem more dynamic. The intro is enjoyable with a few hidden items along the way. The developers have introduced an enemy the player must hunt throughout their adventure which is a nice addition!  One big thing I immediately noticed is that the initial healing item is now 'salve' instead of 'bandages.' I LOVE THIS as it gives a slower heal rate and makes combat more tactical rather than 'tank hits and spam bandages for massive healing. Salve heals 50hp over 10 seconds which means you cannot simply tank groups of enemies early on.  I will update this review as I explore more of the content but initial impressions seem great!",1,1
211820,Starbound,"All of my friends and my wife absolutely loved terreria. I didn't. By the time I decided to give it a go, everyone was so far ahead that I never got to experience that exploration, dicovering things for myself aspect of the game. Now, I am totally getting that from this game. I get to not only explore my own starting world (where I have built a pretty cool colony) but I also get to travel to other worlds and meet other civilizations and colonies. I am having a blast.  Now a terreria vetran may still tell you that this game isn't as good or whatever but it certainly is special to me. I am really enjoying sinking time into it.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Oh Starbound... will you ever reach the the greatness or even the fun standards from Terraria?  No... you won't... which is sad because I hoped this Game will be at least fun to play... it was in the beginning...  Then I realized it was just 'pure grind'  everything in this game is just that. GRIND.  Also the Fullscreen isn't working anymore... which is maybe just a temporary fail but it sucks... really...   It's just really sad that in 2014 when I purchased the Game... I thought it was very fun and a game that could reach the Fun Factor of Terraria... then over the years I realized nearly nothing would change with the game... don't get me wrong stuff was added over time... like races, items, weapons, monsters, npcs and so on...  But adding Mod Support in Early Access could already be a bad sign... because well developers CAN USE THIS ADVANTAGE TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED THE GAME FINISH IT instead of finishing it themselves  But no major or small update brought it even near of something like the 1.3 Update for Terraria...  But the game has a terrible developer behind it that with the massive amount of money they got from Starbound, are they using to, well, publish other games, maybe even start to develop other games, the developers moving locations and try to live in a more expensive town, what I heard bought real pets and so on... instead of FOCUSING EVERYTHING ON STARBOUND AND THEN WORRY ABOUT THE NEXT THING?  I' am very dissapointed Chucklefish...  Update 13th April 2016 Now, I originally didn't wanted to be so harsh on this game. Back in 2014 it actually was fun and this game still has potential. Now when the game is finally going to be 'released' I'll may take a second look and maybe even say: 'well NOW it's actually a Fun little Game!' Well even if I still can't compare it to Terraria. Other than that it does many things 'well enough' that its currently doing. Except for some broken things that I hope are fixed by now.   Well I should say what a 'perfect game' would look like to me...  Cheap  (or the price must justify the content)  Many Stuff to do  (say you must have many possibilities in the persistend game)  A lot of Content (Also features...)  Nice Developers  (I actually don't know much about Chucklefish, those accusations above could be wrong)  Nice Community (Thats Obvious)  Mod Support  (For a more Community Life Support)  Deep (When you still think you haven't seen and tried everything)  Singleplayer and Multiplayer (For both types of people who enjoy playing alone or with friends)  Original (Dont just be ruthless copy or ripoff of something else that is currently popular)  Creative (I always liked seeing things that I never seen before)  Focused (The Game should know what it wants it to be and who its target audience should be)  Replay Value (It should be enough fun so that you want to play it again and again, even get after the 100th time, you don't get bored)  Deep Lore (So I want to learn more about its content)  Great Controls (So that it feels great and responsible, not clunky as hell)  No Useless DLCs and Microtransactions  (When the DLC is actually ADDING CONTENT not just 'SELL SOMETHING SEPERATLEY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME')  Offline Playability (When you have no or bad internet)  Maybe someday everything of this will count for Starbound answell as it did for *cough* Terraria ;) (Well I do compare it alot to Terraria, do I? Even though I guess it got its Inspiration from it 'a bit'xD)  Alright there is one last positive thing I can say for Starbound since the first time I played it. The Soundtrack is amazing ;)  Maybe after it's 1.0 Release I'll think differently about it. Who knows?  But now? I still wouldn't recommend it.  Update 6th May 2016  Also something I noticed just recently is... through the new reviews... yes of course everytime when this game got updated... you lose all your characters... so?  I still don't recommend it.  Update 26th July 2016  A Question, how do you make a game better? By Removing Features and Content? What?  Update 27th July 2016  Compare Terraria to Starbound...  Terraria announced a new update! - Adds thousands of new Stuff! Starbound announced a new update! - Removes thousands of Things!  But really what the hell is going on with Starbound?!  Yeah I know what! Just remove all the Stuff that didn't quite work in the betas and alphas and call it a finished game. Also let the Mod Community finish the game. Even now, I've seen hundreds of Workshop Mods... Improved Interface, Better Customization, More Armors, More Weapons, Mechs, Many New Monsters, Better Ship Customization, Better Farming, More Inventory Space, More Items, New Planets and Biomes, More Outfits etc. etc. All of that THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME... What you see now as 'Mods' or rather 'Let the Community finish what we have started and announced to do from the Beginning Content'  Starbound had such a larger Budget from the Beginning compared to Terraria... WHAT THE FLYING BULLDONKEY HAPPENED WHIT IT!?  *Whispers* By the way it was nearly 5 years in development, from the idea to the 'finished product'",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"it's like a worse version of terraria, only it costs more",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"The game, frankly, was a hell of a lot better when I thought it was 'bare bones' but now I see it had more to offer before.  It felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you.  Now?  Well, theres this insanely half-baked and arbitrary 'story' you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses I have  EVER  seen in a video game.  Some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to:   Crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables, making it boring.   Un-needed crafting times of 0.5 to 10 seconds have been added since early access, which begs the question. Why even have them?   No longer feels like an exploration sandbox.   Race spesific ship AI was removed. (why?)   It also got a lot more annoying.   Guns STILL suck colossal dong.   Game feels like it has less than when I considered it 'bare bones'.   Start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason.   If they decide they want to actually improve their game, I'll change my reveiw as I have done with other things in the past but for now. This game is just flaming garbage compaired to what it was in early access.",-1,0
211820,Starbound,    DISCLAIMER: this review is based on my own opinions and may or may not differ from other opinions.,-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I loved this game, and I can't recommend it now. Now, before this gets written off as just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off reviewer because 'they broke my game,' I just wanna point out some things that were better before and for some reason are gone:  -Planets: Oh. My. God. Why did they make planets boring now? There used to be a randomizer for planets so you had a reason to explore and try to find the planet type you wanted with the weather you wanted in order to settle down for fun. Now you just run through the same few planet archetypes and be done with it. There's no fun in discovering a new planet now. Each one is the same as the last with minor variations.  -Monsters: Monster variety is gone. They did away with the randomizer and instead added biome specific mobs and kept in a couple of random monster parts, but not many.  -Crafting: Not a lot changed with crafting, except that they reduced what you could craft. Every crafting tier has only 2 weapons now. To make matters worse, everyone crafts the same weapons with endgame materials.  -The story: It's not so much epic as just a thing you do. It's not even needed to progress through planets of different difficulty. You could play the game and do anything you want without ever needing to touch the quests past the beginning ones (which are necessary to fix your ship). There's just no point to it.  -Random quests: Not. Random. Have fun running back and forth random locations looking for an NPC that the questgiver lost. Or you have to go deliver a thing. There's no actual randomness it's just those 2. At least as far as I saw and I've gone through like 100 planets.  And apparently there was a thing with pets but I have no experience so I can't comment on whether good or bad.  TL; DR: The game has a bunch of things that were gutted and are no longer fun. Because of this I can't recommend it as is. There are fun elements, but you'll soon be bored of planet exploration, which was the point of the game to begin with.   I recommend people on the fence just wait for more updates to add more stuff, and maybe even revamp some (looking at you planets. So disappointed). Otherwise it's just a normal sandbox. Dig, craft, build, fight. There used to be a great game and I believe there's one still.",-1,0
211820,Starbound,The game in it's self I would recommend however...Tiyl the big cheese of Chuckle Fish has no idea how to handle customers you don't abuse the people who support you and buy things from you... 'Hay yeah can I get a cheeseburger' 'Yeah sure here it is by the way your mentally challanged' 'Ok cool ♥♥♥♥ you from now on I'm going to macas'... He and a few others from CF have got some seriously bad press and quite frankly I think alot of people will not be buying from chuckle fish in the future because of the way they and others in the community have been treated if he handled complaints better I wouldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ when the game comes out but they abuse people cop when they whine is ridiculous there the people buying ♥♥♥♥ from you... If they want to be rude so be it... Suck it up be polite to them and there attitude will change and they will join your side and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing... Treat them like ♥♥♥♥ and call them brain dead and of course they will continue to carry on like a frigin 3 year old... Anyways If you want to support people who seriously call there fan base brain dead and blame the lack of development on them then go ahead the game is fun I just cant stand the people behind it.  UPDATE :  Games worth it get it if you like terraria or other games simiar in design.,-1,0
211820,Starbound,"I wish I could be kinder to this game, but Starbound (a.k.a. Feature Creep: The Official Game Of The Movie) just isn't that great.  Setting aside the farcically protracted development time, the long chain of broken promises from the developers, and the frustrating apologist community that refuses to entertain ANY criticism, the game never rises above being 'pretty neat, but impossible to recommend'. Planet-hopping in concept is really cool, and as block building-style games go, you have a lot of latitude to create some nice stuff, but much of the rest of the content is fairly vapid, and often only serves as an obstacle or chore that restricts you from exploration unless you participate in it to the game's satisfaction. Once you burn through all of the possible biomes and settlements the game can generate, and maybe build a thing or two, there's very little motivation to continue playing.  The changes from beta feel very much like one step forward and two steps back in terms of tooling the game for fun and player convenience. For example, instead of making mining more enjoyable, ore has just been made more easily available through other avenues for players who want to bypass it, essentially mooting one of the primary gameplay modes. No such luck, though, if you hate the game's combat, because Space Farmin' ain't gonna kill the story bosses for you. In that sense, Starbound is more like a mediocre platformer with a huge amount of padding between levels and an excessive amount of optional sandbox side content. Most of my 200+ hours of playtime are 'unearned', in the sense that the majority of them were spent planet-crawling or grinding for resources. In other words, sifting through randomly generated content just trying to find the one thing I needed. So maybe it's more like a sandbox that arms you with a plastic sieve and tells you someone dropped a quarter in it a week ago.  The story itself might charitably be described as 'serviceable', but the story missions are garbage. You can't build or dig anywhere to stop you from 'cheating', but Starbound's combat and platforming are too shallow and unrefined to stand on their own, not to mention the fact that the mission maps are SO poorly optimized that I consistently crash out unless I run the game in a tiny window, despite exceeding the minimum requirements. In fact, I have to regularly save &amp; quit every hour or so because there seems to be a memory leak issue where my graphics get corrupted. Did I mention you can sometimes irretrievably lose all of your teleporter bookmarks for no reason, a bug that has persisted for over a year? Seems like something you'd probably want to prioritize for release.  A game like this lives and dies on novelty, which is fine, but the path to that novelty is gated by tedious, uninventive resource grinding and weak action platforming that runs contrary to the developers' insistent sandbox rhetoric. Copy on the official website claims that Starbound allows you to 'create your own story' (unless you're playing a Novakid, who are completely excluded from the main storyline and still have no settlements, OOPS) and that there is 'no wrong way to play!', both of which are patently untrue with the way the player is constantly shackled to tutorials and story quests that only have one 'right answer' and staunchly refuse to let you think outside the box. There is no story or win state outside of playing the game exactly the way the developers intended, and for a game like this that promised so much and delivered on so little of it, that is quite unfortunate. Not only is the decision to make platforming and combat the 'core' gameplay experience misguided, it seems totally arbitrary, considering planet generation is clearly what had the most work put into it.  At this point, the game cannot be 'fixed' with more content, balance tweaks or fan mods. What it needed was a more focused and unified development cycle, and a team that actually listened to player feedback instead of insisting that being able to play a flute in space was more important than releasing on time, and that ship has sailed.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"I purchased this game for my brother and I, an almost 30$ investent. I had played the game in the unstable betas a while back, and it had loads of potential. When I bought it, I fantasized about what amazing boss battles would be added, what new quests would be added to the outpost, how would they revamp the weapons, crafting, planets, ships. How amazing a central story arc would be. The game trailer had my hype levels through the interstellar roof. My main thought was: Could it even be better than before? The answer, my friends, appears to be no. In fact, the overall quality of the game has fallen drastically from what was there previously.  -The weapons have become less amazing, random, and awesome than before. It has a lack of rare weapons (the cool ones being nearly impossible to obtain,) daggers and hammers are practically useless, and class armor is generic at best. I, along with some other gaing friends, were expecting some awesome end-game set boosts like gliding for avians or endless energy during the day for florans. However these never came true, and armor found in chests is next to useless before even leaving your starter world. Not only that, but all low-teir (copper, iron, gold) weapons were completely removed from the game. Character tech has also recieved a downgrade, with a very small amount of upgrades, and only one in each of the now 3 categories that is worthwhile (spike ball, sprint, and triple jump.) The bubble tech no longer exists.  -The planet system no longer has difficulty sectors, but different teired stars, leading only to a mad dash to the glosest fiery planet for endgame loot. The temperature system has been replaced by the EPP, a barely-augmentable pack that is far too easy and relatively boring to make. Many of the RNG creatures have also become thngs of the past. The mechs, and amzing and fun planetary exploration machine, has been replaced by speeders so expensive that they become obsolete by the time you save enough pixels for them. The crew system, although beneficial, is a real hassle when it comes to upgrading your ship. Also the Erchius Ghost is a pain. Enough said.  The story had amazing potential. I loved every second of the tutorial (grabbing both the flower and the cape,) and I couldnt wait to see what the outpost had. After finally reaching it, I was met with three quests. Three. One for the techs, one for the ore mart, and one for dreadwing. Remember all of those fun personal quests? Gone. Remember spending a hour on mazebound to cash in both a quest and an enormous sense of achievemnt? Pointless. Then we get to the ark. The scan quests? Tedious and annoying. That eigth race everyone was speculating about? Never happened. I remembered being so hyped for the new story quests after beating the Hunting Caverns. But it turned out that every single on of these was a glorified trapped puzzle labyrinth, each with its own theme, and each boss chamber was just a rectangular room. No variation, no truly unique battles. Just hit until you die or it dies, staying in the same room. In fact, the planetary exploration system makes it so you can have end-game gear before you even do the Floran mission, leading to really a broken system. Even after beating it, the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth.  What Starbound desperately needs: -More inventive Boss Missions -A better exploration and teir system -More weapons and unique armors. -Better Techs and Mechs -A larger variation of creatures -The Outpost quests to return  A novel idea would be to have space pirates (a very realistic thing in a univese like Starbound's) that scales up in occurance and difficulty as you travel to better planets. When 'attacked,' you could either pay a fine or choose to board their Randomly generated ship of hostile enemies (of any race, even the non-playable ones.) Once you beat the underlings and possibly a mini-boss 'captain,' you could have a loot chest that also scales with the solar teir. Much like challenge dimensions, there would also be a hidden loot chest somehere in the ship. Once defeated, you would just go on your merry way.  As much as I love Starbound, until it gets some serious updates, I wont be playing it again. ",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"The early access was brilliant, better than this stable version.  Currently the game (1.0 release) has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced, underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end, with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades. It used to be a fun type of grind, but with the general need for more items (volume, as well as different type) to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating. Although the pace for upgrading your MM and Tech feels a bit better. The change to equipping items feels terrible, initially I thought I'd get used to it like a person normally would, but it feels too unnatural. You need to equip many items in general: melee weapon, ranged weapon, torches, rope, trash blocks, flashlight, health kits. That's mainly for exploring, even then more items can be added. And for some reason many items that you think would be single-handed are actually two-handed. Great! Even more switching to do!  The need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony. Go out into that vast universe - and become a farmer! It does get better, but takes away from the experience nonetheless.  The array of items and scenery is great; planets are much more interesting. Playing with friends has never been easier also!  It's got a lot of potential, it always had. They're holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores.  EDIT: I've deleted the comments that commented on my hours, I have at least 60 hours in total and that's a very conservative estimate.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"It's nice that you added a decent story, but all the quests now just feel like filler, including the sidequests.  I want to love this game, but I really can't anymore.  I remember when campfires were used as heat, and there was actually a point in moving to other planets other than just making a b-line to the nearest fiery star or frozen star, just to click on some objects to complete the quest, and then defeat a dungeon and then move onto the next star.  This game used to be great. There was actually a reason to go to some random ♥♥♥ planet in the middle of no where, but now there's literally no point other than to make a colony, which I don't even see how it's useful in anyway.  If you like a very short main story, this is a great game for you. If you like a game with a good long story that actual feels like an achievement doing stuff, don't get this game, or maybe you should have back a few updates ago.  I have to say, it's a fun game, and it's a change from Minecraft or Terraria, or any other sandbox games, but until the devs fix the problems many others have stated, it's not worth buying.  In the current state that this game is in, I do not recommend it, but if Chucklefish were to ever fix these problems, definitely get this game.     Please Chucklefish, fix this game. It has so much potential to be an amazing game, but you've just wasted it.  5.5/10",-1,1
211820,Starbound,The 1.0 release stripped almost all of the content that made the game fun. Planets and monsters are no longer random. Difficulty and progression are locked to your current tier - no more planet hopping to find cool items. Wait for another release when they can put the last 3 years worth of work back into the game,-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound at first looked like a regular 2D Survival game like Terraria. It didn't show me much information for me to be interrested. 'But hey, it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends', and oh boy! I was sure right!  This game combines everything that Terraria missed and combined with Minecraft's 'hugeness' and multiplayer. It may be a bit harsh at first, but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier. Small details that bring people together, just like instruments! You can play certain instruments in this game, and it even has a function to play as a band! It may seem small but its a huge thing to bring friends closer.   The usual laugh mid-game of someone's desgrace and the excitement when someone gets an 'OP Weapon'. The mining adventures and get you lost deep inside a planet. The adventures on the surface battling through monsters and discovering villages of a friendly race. Not to mention the breaks to play a music as a band.  This is a true game to play with friends.   I recommend 100% this game. Yes, it does has its flaws like wipes and character's deletion. But it's in beta. What did you expected? A Bug-free beta game?  Starbound is a great game and it's worth all the money I gave for it. Best of luck to the developers!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"A game too ambitious for its own good.  That's the tragic story of Starbound in a nutshell. I've played it numerous times since the early access, hoping that each iteration would bring forth new content - but in the end, none of those times felt like it was something worth revisiting. Even the fabled 1.0 update, where the game is now fully-fledged and no longer in early game access after three years doesn't feel anything like it should.  Starbound has a lot of great things going for it. The artstyle and presentation of the graphics, while slightly shoddy at times, is well animated and distinct. None of it feels muddied and it has a lot of charm with some of the non-random enemies. The music, while repetitive at times, is relaxing and comfy to listen to. Building your own ship, gathering up crew, making little colonies on planets stocked with people you've hired for the task, Starbound is keen on letting you explore the universe at your own pace.  But therein lies the biggest problem. Starbound is not just a sandbox game, but a sandbox game that is generated across an entire universe. There is only so much you can do before you start running into the same biomes, the same structures, the same villages, the same enemies and their attack patterns. This same problem feels eerily reminiscient of another game, No Man's Sky.  I will say this. Starbound, compared to when I last binged on it two to three years ago, has changed both for better and worse. There is a more streamlined story, more items to grab, more villages and towns you can visit, but with it, the unique quests you get from the Outpost has been virtually made obsolete, barring a handful of them. The crew you take on might as well be robots - they don't say much of anything and rather, their only flavor text is their name and mood. Even the main side characters get maybe a whole page of dialogue altogether outside of their recruitment missions. They don't say anything memorable. In fact, Starbound as a whole doesn't feel memorable. Why is it that its precursor and competition, Terraria, is that much better?  Because Terraria doesn't rely on random generation beyond its overworld. The enemies, items, and whatnot are all mostly going to stay the same in every world generated. Some might appear, some might vanish, but it is a far more static game than Starbound. In fact, Terraria doesn't even have that much of a plot. And yet, it's by far, the superior game due to the amount of unique items, enemies, armors, strategies, and so on and so forth. On the other hand, Starbound enemies, items, armors, and even the main playing strategy are pretty much the same. There are some neat abilities, but due to their random nature, your Beastmode Billywhacker will eventually be replaced by a Junky Moleseeker. In fact, a lot of it got downgraded from the last time I played. I remember when even the most random of enemies had some sort of special move that would force you to adapt. That's all been given to the unique monsters, which are just as dumb. Starbound's progression is extremely weak and the only thing that changes is that the numbers get higher as you go up the ranks. Terraria's difficult combines that with smarter and more varied enemies. Even the NPCs in Terraria are far more talkative than the ones in Starbound. In fact, if Terraria's graphics were better, there would almost be no reason to play Starbound.  All in all, Starbound is only fun if you wish to build and explore with friends. The game, much like our own universe, feels too sparse and dead to warrant anything other than a curious playthrough. It's very much just mining from world to world, running into the same structures and biomes, with little variation in between.  I can only recommend it if it's heavily discounted on sale and you got friends who can tag along. It's nowhere near being the total package that was promised all those years ago. Buy Terraria instead, since not only will you be saving five bucks or so, but you'll have way more fun than going through a developer's tired, broken dreams.  4/10.  ",-1,0
211820,Starbound,"This is a pretty honest review that I can give after playing through the story and going up until end-game.  To note, it took me 3 days of playing to do this.  In all honesty...I get the impression that work was put into areas that were not that important compared to others.  Progression is linear and simple, like so: - Get Thing - Use Thing to get to New Planets - Get New Thing on New Planets to make New New Thing - Use New New Thing to get to New New Planets to get New New New Thing  This rinses and repeats for up to 4 times.  Pros: - Pretty, lots of variety in some worlds, interesting concepts, nice dialogue - Plenty of vanity items to collect and display - Ship can be upgraded, which wasn't a thing back in Beta, which is great - There's actually a story now - Plenty of cool weapons  Cons: - There are only 4 rarities (White, Green, Blue, Purple) with no legendary weapons - Years in development yet feels incredibly basic still - Bugs and loading issues that cause you to stick in the air like a Minecraft Sever (Gross) - The Story is ♥♥♥♥ and short - The only 'truly legendary' weapon is ♥♥♥♥ - There are only 6 tiers of armor - There are only 5 mounts - Crew are useless - Very little 'rare' or 'exciting' content that requires you to grind to be satisfied - Up until end-game it's difficult to farm up resources for specific armor, and it ends up being easier to loot weapons, sell them to vendors, and buy the armor - Various 'gates' throughout the galaxy around various stars yet they all lead back to The Ark (even though you have a permanent teleport to there) - Very little missions outside of the Main Story - No reason to build houses other than for purely cosmetic reasons simply because you ship can hold everything - All workshops have roughly 3 tiers of upgrading and don't unlock anything interesting - You have to farm around planets for days to find theme-based equipment - Pets are useless, but admittedly cute, so that's not all bad - No 'large' or legendary monsters. There used to be some in beta that dropped epic gear. - Challenge areas are no challenge and the loot is terrible - Mystery bags are just horrible. Literally horrible. There's no point doing quests for the measly pixels and all of 1 matter manipulator core - No epic rewards for finish the main story, admittedly the most you get is, literally, a thank you card.  All in all, it's not worth it at the moment, even with it's official release. It just feels very lackluster and bare-bones for what was meant to be a long time coming. Terraria made it's way in less time and had WAY more content than this.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound holds a special place in my heart. I've had the game since 0.1, and on multiple steam accounts. The game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around, but it never QUITE made it.  All of that changed with the recent 1.0 update, marking the full release of the game.  You know have a fully pledged story, with interesting and deep characters, insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8+ bosses. Talking about bosses, they range from everything between a spider made of flesh, to a penguin in a futuristic war machine. Every boss is very unique, and their attacks never cease to suprise me.  There are 6 classes to choose from; A robot, A fish, A plant, A collection of gas, An ape and of course human. This sounds very bazare, but as soon as you create your character, you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory.  Starbound is a sandbox gme, and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be. You can choose to never mine a single peice of ore, never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship, or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds. There is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture, which comes in great use with the colony system.  The colony system consists of you creating a house, and putting a colony deed inside. The colony deeds cost 750 pixels (the ingame currency). You can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves, or weapons and armor. You can get everything from a merchant to a guard, and they all come together with the procedural quest system.  Quests (That arent outpost or story related) are always procedually generated, yet they're still all very unique and fun to do. The people who will give them to you are either random NPC's or inhabitants of your colony.  If you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific NPC, will he request to join you on your adventure, as a companion. It is only possible to have to companions with you at all times, but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound. The sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell, as you can either get companions by making colonies, ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries.  If you get enough companions on your ship (You can have as many as you want, just only two with you) your ship will get bigger, leaving you with more room.  There is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes, and deep and interesting dungeons.  The weapons of Starbound; The weapons come in many shapes and forms, some silly and some deadly. They, like so much else in this game, have prodcedurally generated stats and looks, which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find.  Verdict: If you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create, and many unique enemies and weapons, you're at the right place. Starbound is huge, and for the gamer that likes to read, there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to. There are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets, just waiting for you to find them.  9/10",1,1

211820,Starbound,"Y'all saying this games not as good as it used to be, lmao. At the time of writing this review i have somewhere around 700-800 hours in starbound. its an ok game yes things have changed yes there was neat things in the beta.  thats the thing it was a beta. not everything is going to be the same. honestly i think the new version is pretty ok, because i got bored of the old versions. to be fair it could have been better. but yall are saying this is the better no mans sky. no mans sky is 60 dollars this is 15 dollars  stop expecting gold to come out of 15 dollars heck look what 60 dollars got no mans sky",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Ok, so Starbound, it's fun! I mean, you can build, craft, fight, etc. Like Terraria, but in SPAAAAAAAAAACE! Or that's what people say, that Starbound is just Terraria in space. Which is false, to me anyway. Starbound is so much more open-ended, expansive, etc. than Terraria (In my opinion anyway). Anyway, now for my reasons as to why you should get the game.     Just Came out of Early Access. A lot of people before were whining about how little there was to do, but now that it updated to 1.0, you can expect a buttload of stuff! I have reached the endgame, and I still haven't discovered everything myself. So there will be no shortage of content.     Easy Modding And if you hypothetically do discover everything in the game, there is a very active community just pumping out mods which are as simple to download as a click of a button! Hell, you can even modify and make your own weapons/items with a program like StarCheat which is so easy to do, even I managed to do it!     In-depth Exploration Many people complain that all the planets are very similar, and I think that's because they just skim the surface of the planet and then claim it's not original enough. I'm sure if they took the time to look the planet over, you'll discover so many cool places and strangely unique NPCS. Just give it a chance before you hop onto the next Radioactive Star.    Story/Characters Ok, so serious talk here, shame on anyone who says the story is too simple, like seriously screw you. You should not be expecting Oscar worthy writing from a game based on exploration, and adventure. It's a wise decision by the Devs to allow the game's story to be simple, and allow it promote exploration. I won't spoil the story here, but honestly get the game and experience it yourself. The story and characters, simple as they may be, are extremely colourful and fun, trust me.     Better than Terraria It's better than Terraria.   Oh and another point, stop comparing Starbound to Terraria. 'But waah they're both games with pixel graphics and crafting and-' No shut up. You should never compare games together unless if they are extremely similar, and Starbound and Terraria are two totally different experiences. Yes, so what if they both have pixel graphics and crafting? Just because they share just those two aspects is so ground to start comparing the two. Next, you'll be telling me Terraria is just 2D Minecraft, seriously, stop it.  Well, that was my first review. A few final words. Honestly, just get Starbound now, even if you like it just a little. It's a wonderful, and colourful experience unlike any other which really deserves more attention, And c'mon, it's only 10 bucks.  (PS, that last point about Starbound being better than Terraria was meant to be a joke, not an actual point as to why you should get the game.)  EDIT: BTW Thanks to the guy who pointed out some grammatical mistakes I made.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound is essentially Terraria... if Terraria were a mediocre amalgamation of 15 genres at once. The best word to describe Starbound is tedious. Everything you do in this game is tedious:  Mining takes forever, and one misstep can get you killed. This wouldn't be a problem if the controls worked well, but they are extremely awkward. Also, in survival mode you lose money and drop all your important items on death, so if you die somewhere where you can't get them you're basically screwed.  Farming is absolutely pointless. The plants take way too long to grow, planting the seeds and watering them take forever, and it makes almost no money. Not to mention the fact that inventory management is incredibly awkward and frustrating.   Exploration is boring as hell. Planets are all just generic biomes like desert and forest and plains. Also, there's really no point to building a base on a planet because it's just a waste of resources and you can just put all your things on your ship. Speaking of the ship, it is very minimalistic. There's no deep customization, just (exteremely expensive) size upgrades. Also, it is incredibly slow. The way you travel between planets is just clicking on it and then waiting. There's no interesting gameplay of any description. The space travel is nothing but a gimmick.  The story really has no place in this game. There is absolutely zero orignality to it. Just the standard find all the things to kill the giant monster. I'd say the character interactions are pointless, but you can barely even call them interactions. You have no choices, and the text always goes by too fast or too slow. Also, the dialogue is dull as dishwater.  Gear is horribly implemented. It works similarly to something like Borderlands or Diablo, so you'll be getting tons of useless items that clutter your inventory. And the combat is basic as hell. Every enemy functions more or less the same.  In conclusion, this game is just a lesser Terraria which is more expensive for no reason. Please don't waste your time and money, and play Terraria instead.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Something I've always disliked about Minecraft is that there was no real adventure to talk of. This is the complete opposite, always on the go, always discovering new things.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound is now out and I have completed the story so I can give a proper review of it. I will be covering what I consider to be the main aspects of the game.  Story-8/10 The story of the game is that a big monster blew up Earth and you escaped so you now have to find 6 artifacts that open the gate to the monster. (You find this out in the first hour.) The story has that Bethesda feel, where the game is like 'oh no, this thing happened and you have to do something!,' but you can just ignore it and do your own thing. The story is an interesting aspect, and actually takes you to the different planet types so you have time to upgrade your armor and weapons. I think that story isn't completely necessary, but it works well with the concepts already established.  Combat-9/10 The sword-and-gunplay is fun and focuses on dodging enemies. Your 'Matter Manipulator,' which is a building tool, can be useful for creating cover and such, but some enemies can go through walls. Each 2-handed weapon has a special ability, like grenade launchers and flashlights on guns or spin slashes and warp slashes on swords. There is a variety of weapons, allowing a ton of different playstyles. The bosses in the game are also very well designed and offer up a challenge when you first fight them. These bosses are located in developer-designed dungeons that have many secrets located in them. The combat never gets stale and fights are always interesting in one way or another.  Exploration-5/10 This aspect isn't the best part of the game. You usually see the same biomes and monsters over and over and while some monsters are randomly generated, by the end of the story you've seen all of the environments in the game already. It is fun at the start of the game, but it quickly gets stale and boring. Randomly generated dungeons are cool, but you often find the same style of dungeon as well.  Building-9/10 Building in the game is surprisingly deep and interesting. The colony system offers up an interesting thing to do after the story. The foreground and background building is similar to Terraria, but the game actually offers a good reason to build decorated houses so different tenants move in. This is one of my favorite parts of the game and I have spent hours searching for the right materials for my houses, which leads me to find new things in the game as well.  Soundtrack-10/10 The soundtrack in this game is beautiful and the main theme is one of the most memorable tracks that I have ever heard in games. I cannot stress enough that the soundtrack is worth buying and it adds a layer of charm to the game that I rarely see.  Overall-8/10 Starbound is not the best game ever made, but it definitely has a large amount of content that makes the game interesting for hours. It seems that this game was a board that ideas were thrown at, and some of those ideas stuck and mixed really well. The game also has a kind of charm to it that you don't see in AAA games. Starbound has been a great project to watch as it grew from alpha to beta, and finally to 1.0. Starbound has, in fact, left orbit and hopefully will go interstellar in further updates.",1,1
211820,Starbound,"Starbound started off promising and somehow got worse instead of better over the course of its dev cycle. The game has fully released now but still feels virtually identical to the earliest builds. The interface is clunky and terrible, the progression system and balancing are all over the place, the combat feels imprecise and every planet is basically a palette swap of the last. At the end of the day, it hasn't lived up to any of the promises Chucklefish made during development and the final version is just boring.   Save your money and get Terraria instead.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"Do not buy this, the developers are very rude and bans anyone who gives negative feedback on their forums.  EDIT 07/08/2016;  Update to this; The game is still incredibly bug-riddled despite being 'Released from beta', and there are massive FPS drops at seemingly random times. I'm running a pretty high-mid end gaming PC, and most of the time it averages 20 FPS in this game, despite being able to run pretty much any other game on very high settings at &gt;72 FPS.  If you want to buy it, wait a little. Don't put your money down for it if you haven't already done so.   This is not at all a full 1.0 version. Don't be fooled.  To add to it; You make 15 trading cards, but there's not a single Novakid card, despite there only being 7 races, yet you can still manage to add a human game developer card? That's even dafter than I am.  Don't make a promise if you never want to do anything with it. Considering how many promises they've made and failed to deliver on, I'm starting to not be very surprised at all by them failing to deliver anything competent.  Chucklefish was a mistake.",-1,0

211820,Starbound,"Time to rewrite this old thing now since it's out of EA. Let's start with an admittedly bad metaphor.  Imagine you see a food stand that makes sandwiches. They have only one kind of sandwich, the 'Mystery Sub,' but it's promised to have the ingredients you like on it. Specifically, pickles, butter, and white american cheese, with just a little bit of mayo. It's also pretty cheap, so you order a sandwich. You're told it'll be ready in five minutes.  Those five minutes go by, but still no sandwich. So you go up and ask about it and the guy at the stand says he just started in the food service industry yesterday, and he misjudged how long it would take. Since he's just starting out and he says it'll be the best sandwich ever, you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a little while.  After half an hour of waiting, he finally gives you your sandwich. You decide to open it to see what's in the 'best sandwich ever,' and you take a look at it.  Mayo. Lots of mayo. With one pickle, a big glob of butter, and half a piece of that awesome cheese you like all placed in different corners on the bread, covered in that white goop. In other words, it's technically what you ordered, but it's not half as good as you expected it to be, and was given to you in much more time than you were told it was going to take originally.  Starbound is that sandwich. It has everything they said it would have; exploration, building, even a few dark themes. So technically everything they said it would be. But there isn't nearly enough of that stuff, and mostly samey fetch quests and grinding. The all-important story is shallow and derivative, with every quest pretty much being 'scan random crap, go though dungeon, kill boss.' Rinse and repeat.  Over all, it's not a bad game. It has plenty of stuff to keep you busy for a while, with tons of cosmetics and building items. I would even say the building system is better and more fun than Terraria. But there just isn't enough of everything else that would make it fun and unique; as the old saying goes, it's as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle.  There's plenty of bad stuff that happened in development; with the devs, with the missed release dates, and plenty of other problems. I'm not going to go into it here; if you haven't heard of all the problems with the development and the devs themselves and are interested, you can look it up yourself. God knows you'd get a better explanation from anyone other than me.  So I'll judge it on what it has in it now, not what happened in development in the past. And for me, in it's current state it's a resounding 'meh.' Good for one or two playthoughs, but you'll probably get bored of it before you even get to experience most of the main features. I still haven't even tried the colony stuff, and I did very little farming after 1.0. It's only fifteen bucks though, so if you think thirty or so hours is enough for that price, then go for it I guess. Will you get as much play out of it as, say, Terraria though? No, probably not.  I'm sure I've 'gotten my money's worth' out of it while it was in EA, but I still don't like the game much, so I'm giving it a negative review. Maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 for me.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"In regards to the 1.0 update: If you don't already have the game and were hoping that the big 1.0 update would add a new world of content that would change things forever, you're probably going to be let down. To summarize what the update does; the early-access version of the game essentially involved Chucklefish cramming a bunch of content in the game to make it bigger. They added single-player missions, bosses, and a certain level of progression, but it was all kind of shallow and these elements were purely added just to have more things to do. So finally what this big update does is gives these missions and the game proper plot and progression. There are now lengthier, more plot-involved quests that make more sense than just 'I'm doing this quest because an NPC told me to for the hell of it,' (which is pretty much how quests were in early-access). The story is actually something that develops as you play rather than being explained in a dialogue box at the start like previous versions. For the most part, that's all this update does. Yes, they DID add some new stuff, but the main purpose of this update was to refine and complete the game so that it no longer has that early-access appearance and feel. If you enjoyed/think you'd enjoy the content that was in previous versions of the game, then you might consider Starbound worth a playthrough/replaythrough. On the other hand, if you weren't previously impressed, then there's probably not a whole lot added in this latest update that will change your mind. Regardless, Starbound as a whole is a really good game. It may seem a bit lacking compared to Terraria, but it's very easy to enjoy its unique elements such as exploration, looting, and colonization.",1,1

211820,Starbound,"So close, yet so far.  Short: Terraria &gt; Starbound  Long: The quests are really boring (MMO style). Scan this fight the boss get the artifact come back repeat. Or, find this dude kill the hostage takers bring him back. Or, bring me 4 Silver ore, make Silver bars, make the equipment and bring it to my friend. I'd be fine with that but the rewards are totally not worth it, most of the time you get a 'suprise bag' wich contains either a M.M. Upgrade Module or a Tech Card, that would be cool and all but you get a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of these if you just explore the surface of a planet. I wouldn't mind that too much but you need to complete the main Story to unlock all Shops in the Outpost (Hub like area)The boss fights are really, really, really boring. They're not hard, they just take a long long time to complete. Especially the last boss fight took me about 10 minutes but I didn't take much damage at all. Compared to Terraria the boss fights are unsatisfying and boring. Building a colony on a planet has no real use. You can upgrade your ship upto five (?) times and at that point you have way too much spare space already. Yes building a colony is cool and all but there is no real point to it since all you really get from it is pixels (the currency) and in the endgame you'll already have enough of them. If you enjoyed Terraria you'll mostlikley enjoy Starbound too because the gample is pretty much the same. If you haven't bought Terraria yet, buy it over Starbound.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"The game is like space Terraria but much less to do.  You know the saying? The journey is more important than the destination. Well the journey sucks in this game and there is no destination  Pros:  • Space. • So many interesting worlds and sets. • Missions and story have great aesthetic. • Ships are cool • Decent variety of planets. • Building is easy and the variety of building materials allows for a lot of creativity. • Building your ship can be super cool • There are some very neat random dungeons • The races are very creative • The game is fun with friends  Cons:  • Very VERY limited things you can craft compared to a game like terraria. • Hunger is stupid • Crew system is super underwhelming • A lot of things in the game that feel worthless such as pets, crafting weapons, buying basically anything from merchants. • Way, way, WAY too easy to find everything in the game. Every tear of ores can be found in around 30 minutes of being on your first planet with the ore, and then you never need to mine for it again. • The game has a very short cap. You finish everything you can do in the game after hardly any work.  • Quests that aren't in the main story are abysmal. There are like 3 different quests and they all suck. Go get this, kill this, or bring this to this person. They terrible payout so there is no incentive to do them at all. • Money is super easy to come by and not used for like anything, making it virtually worthless • The character customization options are actually very disappointing both at the character creation and throughout the game • The game is extremely linear for a sandbox, you have very specific paths to take until the end where is seems like they thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥, we need to give players multiple options for armor in a sandbox game”  Summary:  In the end, a lot of the gameplay mechanics seem not thought through and kind of worthless. The game is very incoherent at times, and worst of all, when you get to final tier of armor it is the most disappointing and unsatisfying thing in the game. The only way I'd recommend this game is if you really REALLY liked building and making a town, even then there are better games for that. Because that is the only thing in this game that requires any effort, but that has no payout besides being able to see a ton of people in your town. It’s very disappointing, because the beginning of the game is so fun and new, but as that feeling goes away, you get a very big disappointment. I hope for the game to improve as I’m sure the developers will continue to add to it. But until then, it is a no from me.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"  With over 60 hours played, I can guarantee you ten of those hours sloughing through the decievingly short main campaign and grinding for resources, while the rest of the time I was playing an okay vertical Stardew Valley. Aside from accompanying a friend's mission with a Banjo loadout or trying out the newer mods that weren't fortunate enough to be merged with the final game, the base game leaves much to be desired.  One of the biggest complaints is how badly the framerates could get fudged in a 2D platformer. You typically see a good 20-30 frame loss every time there are particle effects on screen, a large sprite is rendered, or, god forbid, witness a large sprite with alpha channels while hovering over it with the research tool. To put it into perspective, the credit sequence which is crawling text with a slideshow beside it amounts to a whopping 14 fps. That's impressive. It was also a fitting finale that summed up how this game shipped: through massive incompotence, yet kept afloat by a passionate community that has just the right amount of obnoxiousness to be unappealing yet get work done.  If you are a fan of platformers with an expansive sandbox building system, this is very likely a purchase. As it is now, I could not personally recommend this to anyone else until they revisit the main campaign, post-game content, and what is most likely the most shameful resource hog I have seen in a while. Kudos to the first patch that landed, however, as it effectively kept our server from crashing every two hours from a memory leak. These kinds of changes along with what the modding community has been able to accomplish within the last week could mean good things later this year.     Special thanks to Nutmeg, shoutout to simpleflips, love you mom",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"So after a 5 year wait, it's finally released. After all that time, with content updates and changing basically everything in the game, Chucklefish has managed to deliver something truly dull and uninspiring.   Starbound is a fabulous premise, a universe full of potential. After spending some time with the final release, I am left with one question:  That's it?  The quests and story that I've been waiting for the biggest let down. The main quest consists of 2 types of mission:   1. Find a settlement of the specified race and scan their furniture. 2. Travel to a pre-made level and fight a boss at the end.  The side quests consist of 3 types of missions:  1. Deliver an object or escort a person to another person on the planet. Often times this second person is right next to the first person. 2. Kill an enemy for someone. 3. Collect ore or some other item for someone.  The rest of the game, as best as I can tell, is collecting stuff and building other stuff. You can set up a colony, but why would you? So you can get more tedious and boring quests? So you can have a farm? A universe of endless possibilities and farming is the most creative thing you could come up with?  One other thing I noticed is that the monsters seem to have gotten less unique. There are some that still seem to be randomly generated per planet, but there are a few that are on every planet. I don't know if that's a bug or not, but it wasn't like this before.  So after a 5+ year wait, I'm left with a game that has redefined blandness and squandered potential. No, I still can't recommend this game. I don't even want to bother finishing it just to finish it.  At least the soundtrack is still good. But that's it.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"edit: fixed some grammar here and there  During the Early Alpha I was like 'This is good. There's lot of potential!'. Had fun for a few days, especially in multi with a friend. But still it seemed too much unfinished, and so we decided to wait for the final version. A year or so later, when the final launched, we tried it again. It seemed fun at the beginning, they fixed something here and there, balanced it out. It was engaging again for a few more days. I now have played I think a dozen hours on the final version, between single and multiplayer, and finally decided to write this review. (steam reports more hours because I forgot it open a couple of times)  The dev team sadly fell in the old procedural development rabbit hole, and understandably couldn't get out of it. The content seems a lot, but it's really not. The whole mass of the content is in the graphic assets, but for the rest there's almost nothing. Let me get in detail:  1) There are like 3 quests repeated over and over the whole galaxy, including the main questline. The superficiality of the sidequests is evident when you find different villages and you always get the same quest, literally the same one on every planet, from 10 cramped up npcs. This is also apparent with the main questline, that consists of those 4-5 ad hoc maps (unreachable otherwise) where at the end you get to kill a boss (and boy they are all easy to beat).  2) Another major turn-off is the main story. I really think that making the main questline obbligatory for the player goes against everything that a sandbox game is.  3) The sub-biomes are another big problem, they are very superficial too. You basically find always the same 2-3 ones (gnomes, slime, small houses underground, etc). These sub-biomes never give you anything special, nor they have any background story or anything. The crates you find, and you always find them by the dozens, have always the same loot, because each of the few different star types has the same exact loot for all its planets.  4) And then we have the colonies system. You find a planet, build a house, and a random guy teleports in. He does nothing. He will rarely give you one of the same 2-3 quests (they are exactly the same as the sidequests in the game) and then, when he wants, he'll give you finally the chance to hire him (but you don't actually need a crew in the game, and it has no utility whatsoever).  I don't recommend this game. Maybe only discounted and if you plan to play in multiplayer with a friend. Otherwise don't waste money.",-1,1

211820,Starbound,"I've given this game three years and finally came back and finished the final release with a buddy of mine, and at the end of this glorious storyline he summed it up perfectly. 'This game feels like it was completed by a couple of high schoolers, NONE of which have ANY creativity.' Literally, nothing but fetch quests. Like a single player MMO. It gets repetitive really fast.  If you've already played Terraria and beat it, this game scratches that itch. That sandbox 2D itch. If you haven't, don't waste your time and money on this one. Go play Terraria.",-1,1
211820,Starbound,"tl;dr: I wouldn't buy it unless you have a friend that has it but even then I duno. Pretty much mod the crap out of the game to make it worth while cause I duno what the developers were doing over the last few years :(  Oh after editing a bit I figured out what i'm exactly feeling about this game. It feels like this should have been the beta and now we are waiting on the real game. So this review is my first and probably terrible but it is mine and if anything I hope the 5 people on my friends list that have this in their wishlist are a bit more informed and hopefull avoid this shallow game.  Cool Stuff- -First couple of story missions -Space ship upgrading (granted its only room sizes w.e still cool) -Multpile races -Different planet types Trying to think of more -Procedural weapons maybe -Cool special moves on weapons -Underwater and Outerspace bases -Crew recruting -Colony/Tenants -Building in this game is a breeze and beautiful so it has that going for it I guess ill give it that -Hand created enemies -Boring but rewarding random fetch quests ( you kill some cool units sometimes and i've mostly gotten cool things as rewards) -Rainbow knight  Not Cool Stuff- -Story missions after first couple -Space magic is really dumb ( i wanted to like it but they should have left that to terraria ) God theres a lot -No novakid npcs or tenants ( i feel like they don't even exist, i guess i could play one ) -Crafting is like straight up trash as far as weapons are concerned -Magma, Ocean, and Poison worlds ( no reason to explore except for ore and only place to really use the useless boat ) -I felt like the techs were cooler in the betas back a couple years ago -Hoverbike ( to many giant hills to really take advantage of it and it takes tons of damage ) -The crew recruiting is cool the crew members themselves are useless -Omega super god aweful boring enemies -Stupid enemy ai that just runs into you over and over, really boring -Not so random random enemy generation ( cool concept but ive seen the same face on the same body type 100 time but this time he has spikes on his back ) -Pets are about as dumb and usless as the crew sadly ( once again cool concept ) -Unique weapons or legendaries are boring and usually really weak ( i did like the magna orb though ) This is going to be to long maybe? -Moons are dumb ( go to moon with nothing on it except for fuel, that is just plain old fluff content ) -Asteroids are meh ( less boring then moons but no real reason to go there ) -Everything about the UI sucks especially for chests ( you need mods ) -Basically a lot of stuff is just bland except for all the things that were once previously mods of some sort that got inject into the official game like railing was really cool and the novakid stuff which I found out was really a original idea but evolved from a much cool race call the umm Anyemods or something Anodynes    Ya I don't know. I'm going to keep playing it because i'm seeing some interesting mods that change things to better fit how I want to play but I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone. Mods seem to be the only way i'm going to make it through my first playthrough because it is just so boring.   I played this thing a bit around the time of the initial release and then kept tabs on the dev blog ( like had it as my home page ) for a while and I felt like what they were showing was really cool and then it just took them forever to make. I am not a developer so I don't know what it takes to develope a game like this but when like right out of the gate they were like it's going to be out 'blah blah' or wait no 'later blah' I grew a bit skeptical of the game really coming out so after a few years this game was a complete distant memory.  So where are we? I'm what a week or more after the release of 1.0 after not playing this game since pretty much 3 -4 years ago and it still feels like it has no idea what it wants to be.  The long of it for as long as this has become is that I guess I was expecting more from a game that seemed to have so much going for it. This games just regular? Bland maybe I duno. Maybe I was expectin personalized quests for each race or something. I mean so far the quest system that I was looking forward to is just really really bad. I liked the space station mission and was like this is cool, then there was the floran one and was like woah I really like this and by the hylotl and avian or w.e the birds were called again I was pretty much like 'ya this is just boring now'. Oh and jesus that looking for artifact things with the manipulator that was just bad...ya just bad... really bad.  I really wanted to love this game. A game shouldn't make you feel sorry for it ya know, like woah this and this is kinda cool but I don't know what happened with the rest of you sorta feeling?",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,Well what can i say. I got 1200h+ Hours played. Yes i bought the completely Overkill Pack the DLC's and supported the game. But after microtransactions and more and more DLC's i had to give it a bad review. They were promising free content and instead we got paid DLC's and microtransactions. So Overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making.  Don't get me wrong its one of my favorite games. But if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on DLC's that will come out over time. Because even with a -75% sale on everything the game with everything costs ~33€. And after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest DLC.  So what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game. The content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think.   Also playing with 'publics' (people you don't know) can be pretty annoying. It's ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them.   So if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on DLC and maybe microtransactions (for Weapon Skins which are cosmetic) and get yourself into a group to play Payday with.,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Update: It appears that Starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills. This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.  Original Review:  My friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...  So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.  That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release 'We will not ever have microtransactions.' And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.  Last year, there were a series of 'what's next' audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.  Last year, we had 'Crimefest,' where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.  Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were 'FBI Files' (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.  This year, Overkill did a 'Hype Train' event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get 'hype-fuel' points. With enough 'hype-fuel,' rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this 'Mask Pack 2.0.' It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.  And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.  Overkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats. I truly hope your company goes out of business.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"A money-obsessed pale imitation of the first game.  Payday 1 was essentially 'Left 4 Dead, except bank robbers.' It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.  Payday 2 is nothing like the first game.  The sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.  It gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.  The game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.  The game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.  The new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?  Game use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.  Am I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall.   For what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.  All in all a disaster, right from the start.

The same approach is being used here, but in adding this system, Overkill harshly nerfed all existing weapons - including those which players paid for as part of DLC packages.  In order to give players an incentive to pay for skins via microtransactions, existing equipment has been made insufficient to achieve the challenges that already existed in the game prior to the launch of this system. We aren't being urged to buy microtransactions in order to take on more difficult challenges added alongside these new skins - we're being robbed of our existing tools, tools we earned through hours of gameplay or purchased for real money, and then sold a -chance- of regaining the same level of power we enjoyed previously.

The addition of microtransactions is not only a complete contradiction to statements they made earlier, but also an idiotic decision.

Then our reward for our efforts and loyalty was another way for them to squeeze money from us. I'm sorry, but this is just not right. All this aside from the written word from said devs stating that microtransactions would NEVER be introduced into the game.   So, with lies about in game content and more lies about DLC which has been purchased and never released (the Completely Overkill Pack, FYI) it's hard to trust Overkill anymore.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Hey so this is a game that I really liked at first. I played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an up-and-coming indie team. I was right. It was fun. PAYDAY was an enticing, original game that knew not to take itself too seriously. I very much liked the idea. The sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original; as well as elaborating on the purposely far-fetched story. I thought PAYDAY 2 was an amazing game. That all changed when PAY2WIN arrived... They started with a few cheap DLCs. What's the harm, right? Pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point, these days. It's a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little. I honestly prefer a few DLCs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesn't forget you exist (COD). However, I soon found out that what PAYDAY 2 had planned was far worse than anything Call of Duty has EVER done. Overkill released DLC after DLC after DLC after DLC. They just kept coming. Each one more 'elaborate' than the last. If you call paying $5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate. They incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purpose-defeating advantage. They're essentially payed cheat codes, in the sense that a lot of these DLCs pretty much make the game EZ mode. I honestly think that Overkill does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about their 'community' anymore. All they seem to know or care about these days is that DLC=$$$. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off is this new 'Black Market Update' or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they called it. It's literally a copy-paste of the Arms Deal Update from CS:GO. LITERALLY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING. I mean I understand that they're purposely making this update resemble Counter-Strike, but I don't get why. Obviously it's because CS:GO keys and crates have made Valve a fortune, but what's with the unapologetic rip-off of Valve's style? Are they trying to be ironic? Because it's not ironic. It's not funny, or witty, or clever, or even mildly amusing. The whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes Overkill look like the money-grubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO  ANYONE . A couple of years ago, I would have told all of my friends about how fun and original PAYDAY 2 was, and I did; but this game and its devs are garbage now.

The gunplay is nice, the skills give tons of different playstyles, the heists are enjoyable, and the music is amazing.

And that's not a bad thing; it's great, actually. If they actually ♥♥♥♥ing listened to their community, that is, instead of just pretending to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people that play it. Overkill loves money, never forget it. They release tons of DLC, did a whole 'completely free event' back in the Spring where you had to buy DLC to unlock more rewards, and now did another 'completely free event' where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts.  Now, whether or not you consider this Pay 2 Win or not is your opinion, as it is a coop game. But it's still ♥♥♥♥ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event, have them work hard to get all the rewards, then day ♥♥♥♥ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Come ON Overkill. I love this game, seriously, I really do. I haven't wracked up thousands of hours, no, because I don't game much, but this was the first game in my Steam library to break a hundred hours, and then 200 not long after. I was addicted, I was hooked, I joined Facebook Groups dedicated to organizing all-nighter crime sprees on Skype and TeamSpeak. It was phenomenal. The gameplay was amazing. The game was based almost entirely on skill and persistence, teamwork.  Now? Come on guys. I could forgive the DLC stream, I was working full hours back when it started so I could keep up. I could forgive the letdown of Crimefest, I didn't pay that much attention anyway. You guys went from consistently updating the game with ACTUAL improvements, focused on bug fixes, detailed missions and new weapons that created whole new playstyles, to microtransactions, nerfing weapons to practically make the skins mandatory, and not even nerfing them well, resulting in the entire balance between weapon types being thrown off, breaking the game.  We get it, you want our money. You're a game developer who, only a couple of years ago, was fresh on the block. Then you managed to crank out an absolute masterpiece, you couldn't handle the boom in media attention and community growth, and you got carried away. You know what? I can forgive that. I can forgive you for trying microtransactions, and skins, and drops. I can forgive you, for trying new things. You are now a new BIG game developer on the block, instead of a new SMALL one. You'll make mistakes. I can forgive that.  But I cannot forgive the lying and manipulation you've done to the community. One of the best gaming communities outside the professional gaming circuit. A false apology, refusals to remove the failed tests despite the damage they've done, news blackouts...  We trusted you guys. You gave us an INCREDIBLE game, you were doing SO WELL.

I don't play this game anymore, I haven't for around 3-4+ months now (From when this review was made), and I don't plan on coming back to it again, especially at the rate that it's going.  Can I just point out before I state the obvious that this p*ss poor compnay, has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people, are actually tired of their s*%t?  They promised things like safe house customization, a new enemy, and a few other things here and there. Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No. Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.  Not to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's 'New content' when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII. It's basically saying 'We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons.'  Now then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.  Talk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist  http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv  Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdYRBDMJpI   'The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER' Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.  1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face. The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system. 'Oh that's just like CSGO though!' Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose. Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade. 'Oh you don't want the crate?' CSGO would say, 'Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!' Payday = 'Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch.'  2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!  3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT. I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.  Ending = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it? F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to. It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.  Fight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing? Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it! Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up. Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you  http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gif   Edit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation. Really? That's, it?

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I got 700h+ on record, bought almost all DLCs and now the developer breaks promises (no microtransactions) and adds paid stat boosting skins to weapons. Can't recommend the game as long as this feature is not changed to at least only cosmetical skins.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2 would be a much better game if its developers respected its audience. The game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of DLC which brings a noticeable power creep in, despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just pre-orders.  It is a four-player co-op shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of AI-controlled police. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead's model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities, that's the model Payday 2 went with. As you level your character up though, you get new abilities, and you acquire new weapons to fight with.  Mask customization is probably the highlight of the game, with there being an enormous collection of masks, materials for them to be 'made' out of, patterns to put on them, and colors for those patterns to be. You can make some really fun stuff, play a lot, and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask you're wearing but any mask in your collection.  That said, while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here, I cannot recommend the game.  First off, for gameplay reasons: in Overkill, probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork, the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots. If you're the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear, and the game gives you the tools to do that, there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy. What you'll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapid-fire as possible (unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun, in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable).  This means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category, you can easily narrow each category down to one or two 'best' guns, and the others are only there if you're comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using.  Then, of course, there are the business practices of Overkill. The game was profitable based on pre-orders alone, and while free content and map packs are added, so is a lot of cheap cash-in DLC that often includes pay-to-win mechanics: at first you needed DLC to have grenades, now you need DLC to have the powerful molotov cocktails, and a separate DLC for the useful ninja stars. Do you want the best gun possible? Then you need to buy the mod pack DLC.  Even content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game: John Wick was added to the game as a playable heister, supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in. Another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer.  Most recently as a 'reward' for completing challenges ahead of Crimefest, Payday 2 was given a crate/key system just like in CS:GO, where as a 'thanks' to the community now a portion of your post-heist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a 'drill' to open it, where it will then give you a random weapon skin that, just like with the DLC, makes your weapon stronger.  Is there fun to be had? Sure. But there are other games out there that are just as fun, but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets. Go play one of them instead.",-1,1

Today 30/05/16 Overkill pre-announced the update #100 for the game,basically they bought the game rights back from the publisher(505Games)and announced that the priced drills will be REMOVED for ALL the upcoming safes,this basically mean that the safes will keep dropping but that they will automatically be open for FREE,no more drills,you can still trade the skins but NO NEED to use drills to open the safes(all the 'old' safes will still require a drill to be opened but they will remove the drop for them).  Now this means they actually better now no more Overkill liars? kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkill  Here  [www.twitch.tv]  they said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...  Now that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)  So as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.   My review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.  EDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that 'force' them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or max 50% true,what is sure is that Overkill agreed with the introduction of MT's,maybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knows,people think that after several months after the Black market update aka skins and MT's introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for free,so basically there's still a lot of stuff from Overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better.  ['OLD' review will remain here as reminder of what happened]   As you can see from my hours on record,i'm a PayDay 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this game/devs since the start lovelly idea's and a Developer different from the other one's,i saw a lot of things change,some were cool and fantastic,some less but Overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they don't like and as always i was there enjoying the game,a Developer that actually listen to the user request/feedback is hard to find this days,that's one of the reason why Overkill WAS my favorite game Dev,some months ago they started releasing REALLY low quality and Buggy DLC at full price every month,the last one was the worst of all time(chyvarly DLC)and now at the time of this review,they introduced micro-transaction in the game,just to let you know they always said that they will NEVER introduce Micro-transaction in the game because they said they absolutly don't like that kind of things,and today they've done the exact opposite.   EDIT:21/10/2015 In the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushed/last moment card drop called the Wolf Card that give's you a drill for free,nice move Overkill nice move,but it's not what we asked,the Micro-transaction have to leave FOREVER,they never was something to add to this game as Almir said at the game launch 'We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)' this is someting that have to be removed,you lied to us Overkill,and that's what you got Tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world.  EDIT:25/10/15 Worst crimefest ever,a fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as 'rewards'.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Great game ruined because the devs are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. Weapon skins that give you better stats? CS:GO Syle crates? Overall its a decent game, but the devs have decided to screw over the community. They could have at LEAST not added stats to the skins. But nope, gotta get that money while ruining the game for the playerbase. GG guys, uninstalling.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"A once wonderful game, ruined by greed. We were promised no micro-transactions and we then, we got micro-transactions.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2," EDIT: While the game has been reclaimed by the original developers without extra additions, it currently feels as if it's a dead horse, being beaten with the skin and DLC stick.    This game is generally good, and has a plethora of user-created mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops. But enough of the rose colored filter and let's get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game.  1. The community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices. You'll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than you're new and/or learning the game, or haven't tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host, who is apparently some incarnation of a god. Joining a friend usually solves this problem.  2. Peer to Peer game hosting - You'll always be at the mercy of someone else if you don't host yourself, the game is liable to crashes, freezing, frequent desync issues, and random disconnects.  3. The game has an infurating amount of DLC, and your performance compared to the players who do have the DLC is almost insulting. An example of this being the Gage Sniper Pack. Make no mistake, with this game you will have to PAY.  4. A worrying trend with Overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied, and occasionally bundling it up as DLC. What was a boatload of hype with 'The Dentist' and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment, with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in 'The Golden Grin Casino Heist'.  5. When Overkill does make content that affects gameplay, it is usually overkill (No pun intended) on how it's balanced- creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you don't use said items or skill builds.  6. The nature of some of the DLC content has become Pay2Win, for instance - The Buzzer, a melee weapon from the latest Golden Grin Heist. Using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including Special Police Units. This trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties.  7. The game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style, however you'll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively.  8. Stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer, where a mis-step on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons. However, multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer. The desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as AI detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client (who is usually just moments behind the host).  What usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of DLC that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"This was the best game i've ever played. But why it's now garbage. The amount of DLC'S that have been produced, 26! What the f***, it costs more then the game itself! Even when it was $50 and the worst part is. $5 for a few masks, and some mostly terrible weapons that are just for looking cool. Sure, some are good, but still $5.00. I've had this game from the start, it was amazing despite all the bugs. But now it's basically become Clash Of Clans. I preordered this game, the least they could do is give us the seasons pass or a few free DLC'S for trusting their game. Also, $5.00 for a character. Seriously, now it's just $5.00 for a character soundtrack and skin. ALSO, the amount of hackers on this game is pathetic, seriously they need to stop it. Also, look at Payday: The Heist. It has 1 DLC. This has 26. Don't even get me started on $7.00 on a map, seriously it should be free, we paid for the game we should own the whole thing. The worst part is that there is other games (like Terraria) that have released sooooo many free updates without any dlc. And we get 'Old Hoxton' and 'John Wick' and we get 5 dissapointing maps.  Do not buy this game, i'd urge you to download Clash Of Clans instead of this.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I've been playing this game since its beta, back then, the game used to have a lot of potential, It was a game I was excited for back in 2013. When Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels. At this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.  I would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.  Of course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.  Back in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group.  Reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark. And then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye. Not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.  A couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.   Then we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the 'free' rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ 'support' with 4 masks and a weapon skin 'crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible'). I suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.  But this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough. Fast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward. And then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system à la CS:GO. 'But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?' Well, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.  Meanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.  I cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.  The game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2," TLDR: The game is full of advertisements and unkept promises.   The game was good, but not anymore. Overkill have shown great innovation in how to mess up a great game. I've played the game for nearly 1,000 hours, so I'm not someone just blindly hating, nor do I take any pleasure in giving, what used to be, my favourite game a negative review. -They fill it with advertisements, essentially turning it into a massive billboard and showing they have no care for the game itself, just the money it generates.   A John Wick playable character   Two Hotline Miami cross-promotions   A illogical heist based around a no name DJ with his face plastered throughout it and you are forced to listen to his music. The worst part? This  advertisement  costs $7USD   An Alienware promotion that was 2 masks and 1 melee which was built up for 3 days and the masks are only for people that own an Alienware Alpha, a $500 console   A Speedrunners crosspromotion requiring you to own Speedrunners which took up a day during an event which was supposed to be full of free content   A mask to advertise a VR which Starbreeze had invested money into   A 30 day countdown which ended on Payday 2's 1 year anniversary, which was filled with references to characters and locations in the game's universe, to advertise a new game they would be developing   A melee weapon from The Walking Dead  -They promise a lot of content, some which was paid for, some which was earned through community accomplishments and some which was supposed to be free, yet they don't release any of it and constantly delay it whilst they release a large amount of DLC in between.   Safehouse customisation was supposed to be a feature since the start of the game and was used as part of the game's advertisement, has still not been released almost 2 years later and shows no sign of it being released, they recently claimed they don't even know what it will be   An event which required the community to reach certain amount of members before October 2014 in order to unlock content has had much of it's content delayed including; FBI files, which have been delayed until at least 2016 and they have claimed to not know what it will be and a new enemy type, which is in the same situation as FBI files.   The Completely Overkill pack was a $20 pack which was available for only a month and limited to 50,000 copies. It contained 4 masks, a secret item to be released at a later date and was supposed to be for Overkill's biggest supporters and they claimed it was not supposed to be a donation at all, they even passive-aggressively commented upon those who didn't buy it. After the pack was no longer refundable, they then announced that the secret item would actually be 25, but purchasers would only be able to obtain 1 out of those 25 items. It's now 4 months later and Overkill have insisted on keeping their biggest supporters in the dark, the only information they have given about these 25 items is that it is a part of a larger project and has no ETA at all   The infamy update, which was released in January 2014, was released unfinished. They delayed the remainder of it for over a year, despite it being the most requested update by the community, while releasing SIXTEEN paid DLCs in between. The reason for it being delayed for so long is because they wanted to make it as awesome as possible, but evidently that was not what happened. The update consisted of 8 masks and that's all.   The Golden Grin Casino heist was promised to be released by the end of 2014, but they delayed it. It's now being released nearly 7 months later after being palmed off to another company, though at least since they sent it off to another company, it will have less of a chance of being a bad heist. Since the Casino was announced, they have released a large amount of other updates.   There were supposed to be balancing for the new Swat Van Enemy, this was promised 3 months ago and there has been absolutely no indication of there being any changes.

I might not have alot of hours put into the games, but it was a nice game to get back on once in a while and Crimefest was the perfect opportunity to get back in now.  After seeing the First Day Update of skins that BOOST stats of the weapons and the gambling mechanic, which costs as much as a key in TF2 or CS:GO, i deinstalled and im never going to look back.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Game used to be fun. Not anymore. Pointless grinding and the money-making policies of Overkill ruined it.  Aside from 200$ and more in DLC with overpowered weapons and weapon classes people with the vanilla version have no access to (e.g. RPG, any sniper rifle, any LMG, grenades), Overkill introduced a crate system similar to CS:GO, Dota 2 oder TF2.  This was 'rewarded' to the community for completing challenges set by Overkill for the annual Crimefest. Payday 2 is nothing but a money grab for the developers. They don't care about their players at all unless they critisize Overkill in which case they will be banned from the forums and their posts deleted.  This game is a rip-off similar to 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' and the like.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"The game was great, but instead of fixing important bugs and fulfilling their promises they decide to pump out more and more DLC for ridiculous prices. With two more years of DLC cash grab coming up I no longer have faith in this game. Yes, DLC is optional but the game without DLC is rather limited and not worth it's money. The insane amount of DLC also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns. You get kicked from games because you don't have the right DLC related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless you're willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required DLC. This sort of DLC policies ruin the gaming industry and based on all this I simply can't recommend the game.  And now they added microtransactions in what was supposed to be a period of free updates (crimefest). This only adds to my earlier frustration and only confirms my earlier message.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"So this is my review after 1856 hours of Payday 2; been a fan of the franchise since PDTH. Please keep in mind that i'm german and english is not my native language.  We've been let down and were lied to quite a lot by Overkill Software for the past few years, since the release of Payday 2.  Some of the bugs which have existed since release and the absolutely horrible netcode with all the desync have never been looked into despite the fact that they were mentioned and complained about quite a lot within the community forums.  Yes, i'm aware of the fact that desync is basically the way the engine handles lag but it's not normal to lag behind for 10 seconds or so while in any regular game you're probably having a ping of 300-400 ms connecting to anyone across the world. Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.  Another example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.  Guess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it 'once the dust settled' and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.  The release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC .  The optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine. We also had a DLC called 'The completely Overkill pack' which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released. The Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.  They used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).  There was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.  Safehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.  For the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the  PD2Stats  [www.pd2stats.com]  site to read the story about all of this yourself now.  The latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past. Proof:  Proof #1   Proof #2   Proof #3  [www.gamespot.com]  The community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself. They basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced. The Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own. A single drill costs 2,49€ right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99€) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24€). All of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for. They even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums.   Proof   Personally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20€ and comes with additional DLC worth about 110€ should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.  They disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to 'create' skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories.  My very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.",-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"Time for a serious review after all the 3k playtime hours jokes *Last updated 17/11/15*   CONS:  -After crimefest 2015 Overkill has added microtransactions into the game and completely ruined the playerbase with Crates, Skins and a bunch of other crap. The game is now completely Pay2Win and none of the 'Free' fun is in it. And paid skins actually give you an advantage. yay. Not to mention 2 years ago they promised to never ever add microtransactions and then hoped people would forget a few years later and back stab them. shame on you overkill!  -Short repetitive maps with small objectives, most maps are just drilling, getting cash and going to the escape zone. Only a few maps are low with lots of objectives and loud action such as Hotline Miami, but those aren't a lot of maps. Most maps are just small with not many verities, most missions require you to camp at a small place and fight through waves of cops. compared to PAYDAY: The Heist where everything is open with lots of objectives and places to look through.  -A 2 years old game that hasn't been optimized since the release, the players have to trust and struggle with mods in order to get a playable FPS in game.  And of course the latest maps they released, received a crap ton of complains about low FPS because the maps are so huge and their game is so poorly optimized.  -The textures are so rubbish that modders have to make HD mods so you could enjoy something rather than 1024 textures of your character model or NPC's dropped weapons (etc) Sometimes i stand in a corner and see pixels on the floor trying to look like a pepsi can and other trash.  -AI is literally useless in this game, all they do is follow you and help you up. Nothing else, absolutely nothing. so Multiplayer co-op is the main focus of this game, offline isn't as enjoyable as online.  -Apparently DLC releases are more important than bug fixes The game has a sh  it ton of bugs that haven't been fixed since the release.  -If you want to actually enjoy the game and advance most your weapons to be Death Wish compatible you will need to purchase a few of the DLCs, or else its nearly impossible for a beginner. If you don't pay, you are simply underpowered. Thank god there's no PvP. Although its nice that paying for DLC isnt a must to play a certain map. (Seriously RPG, Nade launchers and Flame throwers are great)  -A community based off most players farming their infamy ranks on SR or HB and considering themselves pros and kicking everyone under the level Infamy 5 from their lobbies and considering themselves as Godlike heisters. No one actually cares about the heist plan, your role or the in game objectives. All they care is that medic or ammo bag you bring to the heist to supply them.  -Over 2 years old free promised content hasn't been released until this very day.  -Most lobbies are too mainstream that its simply hard to find something different these days, like a loud Bank Heist or a Heli escape on Big Bank (you get the point).  -Developers listen to the community yet they are too bi  tchy to invest in a Workshop or a proper freaking in game AntiCheat.  -Infamy ranks are not as satisfying as you might think, they're actually easy to grind and a sh  it that isn't rewarding.   PROS:  +Cheap DLCs (recently also got a price drop) +Monthly updates (DLC fun) +Not a lot but enough free content from time to time to keep the Helmets Flying +Mod support but they won't bother investing a workshop so we stop paying for sites to save mods +4 and maybe more years of in game content support (2 more years of dlc and free content) +A somewhat 'Okay' plot in the background of the PAYDAY gang and Hoxton's betrayal. +Wide variety of weapons, masks, modifications and so on. +A somewhat balanced skills and perks system yet still buggy at some points.   I wrote a lot larger review than this but steam didn't let me post this because i wrote too much. Anyways, i will clearly keep playing this game. i don't dislike it but i experienced and saw way too much in game to know that this game isn't something a new player would enjoy. I would personally uninstall and ask for a refund if i tried to join lobbies 10 times in a row and some infamy trashy decides to kick me instead of giving me tips or helping me out.  Also, this is not a DLC complain post, i own them all and will probably own future ones as well. No flame no hate, i love Almir and the other developers but you can't force the whole community to behave and stop being as co  cky as Hoxton is to Houston.  edit: Yes, know my English is absolute MINT.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"The developers milk the game like a cow now. In the update celebrating the anniversary of the game the developers added game skins, so the game can become another 'uncrating simulator', like TF2 (which is free, mind you) and CS:GO (Which doesn't have 28 DLC's that you have to pay for). I wouldn't mind it as much, if the skins were just cosmetic, but they aren't. That's right, SKINS give you an actual advantage, since they boost stats. Also some of the skins are just for DLC weapons, which will most likely lead to situations like this:  Overkill: 'Oh you just spent (a ton of money on keys, or as they call it 'drills') and actually managed to unlock a cool skin for the RPG, nice. Now, would you like to use that skin? What's that, you don't have the DLC for it?! Welp, better go spent another few bucks, since the skin is useless until you do!'   The things that the developers were supposed to add during the anniversary celebration were promised to be free, instead we got this. They tried to make us feel better afterwards by adding cool things such as heists from the first game, masks (a ton of them) and... a jumping animation, which to me serves the same purpose as applying lube AFTER getting rammed from behind.  I really worry about the future of this game, (or the gaming industry in general) if other companies will follow Overkill's example...",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I can't recommend this game. Despite the amount of hours I've put into it, I simply can't recommend a game that's slowly deteriorated to the point that it's more of a chore than a joy to play.  When I first got my paws on this game, it was back when there were only a couple of DLC packs, where 'infamy' wasn't a thing to prove your worth, and where players were actually more creative and dared to try new ways of completing heists rather than just repeating the structured meta that they believe they must abide by at all costs.   Now Overkill promise us 2 more years of 'supporting' the game, which in their language means to churn out more DLC weapon packs instead of new and inventive missions. Not that it makes the slightest of difference in the rare times that they do add extra content, as lobbies only ever consist of the same mission repeated over and over that gains them high exp (case/s in point; Hoxton Breakout and Shadow Raid).   So I start with my first major issue; the community is mostly full of pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. With a minor amount of exceptions, high infamy players think they're the ♥♥♥♥. If they're not trying to order around the lower/none infamy players, they're kicking them from matches instantly, practically defeating the whole objective of helping them to learn how to play.  Bare in mind, 'infamy' means nothing in this game, at least not how it used to (when infamy only hit 5). It doesn't prove how much experience you have at the game, it doesn't make you any stronger or makes you any wiser. It's just simply for those who are bored of sticking to level 100, and want to repeat it all over again to collect infamous masks and recieve exp faster. What's more ironic is that most of these high and mighty players have only gained their ranks through repeating the same mission over and over until they're given exp penalties and/or their brains turn to mush, which would explain a lot about their attitude. Either way, they have no room to mock others for learning missions when they're only accustomed to one or two missions themselves.  And I wouldn't make an issue out of this and call it a con to the game if it didn't happen as often as it does, but you will experience this... a lot. If you're new, just try to stick to players around your level if you want to avoid being patronised.  So unless you've got a handful of friends to play this with, most of your playtime here will be spent browsing for servers via  'Crime.net'  trying to find something other than the tedious Hoxton Breakout mission, only to join a server and either get kicked for some bizarre reason or lose connection to the host.  Furthermore, the game just seems to have lost of lot of its initial sense of cooperating as a team. If only for helping to take down enemies in the waves of loud missions, nobody really needs to work together with players anymore. Nobody is really assigned to a specific role, nobody really cares what your priorities ingame are, just so long as you bring them some extra ammo and health kits. It can literally be a one man job if the player has a good idea on what he's doing, especially when it comes to completing missions in stealth, which are usually better off alone due to desync issues and ridiculous random glitches that often occur.  In the times that you do actually get into a full party match with random players, nobody ever wants to think outside of the box. Everybody has a strict and structured way of playing each and every map, despite the fact that the game implements a 'random number generator' system to change your experience each time you play a heist.  Heck, if you dare to open the door to stairs in Hoxton Breakout, prepare to be called a noob for not using it on a shutter door or the damn armory. Or if you want to just play 'Bank Heist' in loud for once, the public won't be happy and normally quit immediately. This is down to the community and the game itself. Heists aren't as free and open as they'd fool you into believing. Sure, you can choose to play most missions loud or stealth, but once you make the decision between the two, then you stick to the same objectives. Nothing ever truly random happens, such as random last minute objectives or a change in plan. The closest thing you get to that is the pre-planning stage before a heist, in which you choose your escape plan and place a few packs of ammo to make your life easier. If you're lucky, your pickup helicopter might land on the other side of the map. Whoopie. They even allow you to draw in the pre-planning stage, which is just completely pointless, as nobody ever really plans their heists out. Most stealth heists just end up in a game of trial and error.  So the remaining issues I have with the game.  - It's been out long enough, yet the devs just haven't really given players enough options to optimise their game to their liking. Not a major issue, but still a pain that players have to use user made mods if they want to improve their performance.  - None of the missions are long enough, and/or are just repetitive and tedious. Most loud missions are just placing a drill and surviving waves of enemies until the drill is complete, and then throwing bags of money around. Stealth missions are pretty much the same, minus waiting around for drill but instead having to avoid the line of sight of guards that somehow have the ability to walk through walls when the game decides to have a glitchy moment.  - The card drop feature in order to gain masks and weapon attachments is just another reason the game is more of a chore. It's also the perfect excuse for Overkill to sell you their 'mod pack' DLC or other weapon DLC to speed up the process of finding those much needed attachments for your weapon/s.  - You're literally paying for achievements with some of the DLC. Yes, despite the fact that you've paid £3.99 for a pack, you will be unable to use all of its content until you've completed the required achievements.  - Unless you're buying DLC, most of the free weapons are underpowered in comparison, further forcing you to buy the DLC if you want the most from this game and to be on par with the other DLC paying players. Hell, anything that Overkill do give you for free is still underpowered or weak in content compared to the DLC.  - It would seem DLC is a priority over fixing game issues and errors. I mean sure they eventually get around to fixing those issues, along with the release of another DLC pack.  So in conclusion, I guess you might consider it unfair to judge a game mainly by its community. But it's thanks to the game itself that the community is set out how it is. The game relies on a good community, but fails to support it. The game is currently in a state leaving the players with nothing more to do than grind for exp or test out new DLC weapon packs. And it's the repetitive and tedious missions that leave you with these only options. And I mean 'repetitive'. There's literally 4 missions of the same 'Bank Heist' which is just the same mission with different items to throw in bags, yet these are considered 'unique' from each other.  In the beginning, the game really felt like something new and different. New ideas promised, (which have since been 'put on hold') and the players actually seemed to play for the fun rather than the rank beside their username. Now it just feels like the developers don't know where else to take the game. They won't give us a Steam workshop, yet will release new weapon packs often. They leave it to modders to create unstable LUA mod to help improve their game experience and fix issues the devs are fully aware of, rather than fix these issues themselves.  So up to this point, until they decide to actually improve the game, quit with the DLC priority and help the players have a better experience, I simply can't recommend it.  So here's to 2 more years of nothing but weapon pack DLC, and a whole lotta unfixed bugs.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"A review in the form of a heartfelt open letter to Overkill.  Dear Overkill Software,  You don't know me, nor do you care to know me. But you know my money, and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value. I bought your game back when it was in beta testing. You know, when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 1/3rd of the game? And that pre-orders would get all future content for free?  I cringed when you lied about us only playing 1/3rd of the game in beta. All you did was unlock our levels to level past 30. And gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already. Only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less.  I moaned when you started releasing DLC heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us. I even b*tched when you only gave us pre-order alpha and beta players a single $5 DLC for our investment into the game's future.  But the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing, It was everything. Your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends, of which there where a sizable few, to not touch your game in years. The last heist I did willingly for fun was Shadow Raid for point of fact. Back when it was freshly released not even a week old.  A friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your DLCs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current. We did the Hoxton break out as it was new, and again, I noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more, and pay you more money.   As it was, i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope. None of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team, and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time.  That is only one example of how you'd turned this game into DLC Quest. And what of your lies that pile upon this? We where promised things to do with our off shore money, and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization.  Nothing ever came in the time I played. Nothing of reason or value. And as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game, but I could be wrong. The point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even -AT- release in the case of safe house customization. But they where blatant lies designed to get our money.  I may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this, but the message will be clear regardless. After spending nearly 100$ in this game, I still don't have all of the DLCs, nor do I want them at the rate you're going.  You're not getting a penny more from me, nor my friends who use to enjoy this game. And that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory, even competing with Skyrim, and trumping Overwatch for the shear fun.   But if I have to keep paying for your DLCs to stay in current content. If I have to do asinine, borderline moronic, achievements for critical items. If I have to be force fed lie after lie, I do not want to play your game. Nor will I play the next.   When Payday 3 comes out. There had best not be any DLC for the first 6 months. You owe us that much. The first 6 months should be free content as you'd promised us we'd get this time but lied to us about. I and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any DLC in the first 6 months.  Money talks. You built a game a bout stealing it, and in the process stole mine. It's time to put your theft where it should be, in the game not in reality.  Yours truly, A very disappointed, and spurned fan.  PS: Even having spent at or arround $120 on this game, and owning over half the DLCs it would still take another $90 to buy all the current DLC I dont own. Buyer beware, they will nickle and dime you to death.  PPS: I'd like to iterate that payed DLC is not a bad thing. It’s the content and quality Vs price margien i'm upset with, a well as frequency of paid Vs free DLC. The main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting. Had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many DLC, I'd likely have bought more DLC and played longer as a genuine truth. Had all Missions been Free and guins been the only DLC, i'd likely have been able to pick and choose what i want, or need in the case of meta weapons, easier. Or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed DLC i'd likely have been less happy with that than any other option but it’s still preferred to what you’re doing now.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"When PayDay 2 was released it was so much fun to play, there was no other game like it and had a really good developement team who would update it a lot and for free and this now annoys me to rate it negative because I used to play this game a lot and enjoy every second of it. but after about 6 months the game just kept getting worse and worse as the developers started trying to milk money from this game by adding tons of pointless DLC which barely contain anything and are priced at £3.99 each which is a lot considering that you basically get 4 masks, 4 new melee weapons (which are basically pointless), a few paintjobs and a new gun, the game is also extremely repetitive after a while, most of the maps are pretty small if they are Non-DLC and have a boring set up as they basically just move a keycard or close a door whenever you play it again, there are a lot of weapons in this game which is really good as there is a huge variety and a good weapon modding system but this gets quite annoying as the mod you want for a gun is so hard to get as you can only get one drop from a heist and most of the time it's just an annoying paint for a mask which you don't want. the last time I played this game a lot of hackers were in it and they just ruined the game because they were either there to troll you and ruin your stealth or spam the map with loads of money bags which just crash your game, another annoying thing is when your trying to stealth and some troll joins your game throws a grenade or shoots and alerts you and leaves straight away, I know you can avoid this by having private heists but most of the time your going to want to play with other people as it's easier and more fun.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Overkill are untrustworthy. Several representatives of Overkill claimed that Payday 2 would not include micro-transactions. One such represenative said that it would 'never' happen. And yet, they implemented micro-transactions as part of the 'free' Crimefest II update. Moral of story: Never buy Overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless.  Furthermore, independent sources claim that Overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update, even mods 'approved' by Overkill such as HoxHud, by supposedly removing the LUA Hook required to make mods work. If true, such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time.  Finally, that Overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a 'reward' for completing community challenges in the Road To Crime Fest Event shows complete and utter contempt for the Payday 2 community. Keeping in mind that the Road to Crime Fest Event is all about celebrating the anniversary of Payday: The Heist - which is ironically micro-transaction free. Clearly Overkill have grown fat on the profits of their hit DLC train known as Payday 2, I say that because every employee at Overkill must be on acid for them to collectively conclude that this was the right way and right time to implement something that they'd previously stated they'd never do.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I tried, Overkill, I really did. You didn't fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new DLC, and new enemies that were unfair WITHOUT DLC, and I tried to ignore it. I loved this game, I really did, and I played it to virtually no end, even at one point abandoning Team Fortress 2 for it. 'Weapon packs' that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in, with nothing useful to add, just one gimmick weapon to grab people's attention in the hopes that they'd buy the 'Wacky' item, and I tried to ignore it. I got over the fact you never bothered programming Cloakers properly, and that they're happy to kick you from the ground floor on Rats whilst you're on the roof if they can't think of a way to path to you. Desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial 'Patch' that vaguely improved it whilst drop-in joining, even though a community mod (PocoHUD) addresses the issue perfectly well, and I got over it. Refusal to add limb hitboxes because they'd be 'Too much unnecessary work' when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it, but I STILL got over it. Your treatment of loyal fans on Twitter, e.g. the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of 'IF I LOVED A GAME ID BUY IT ON PC' (As though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment) I resented, but I played on regardless. The Hype Train, a pay-to-enter version of a previous free event, that provided us with an advertisement for a future pay-for DLC and an enemy that's virtually immortal without DLC, that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way I tried and tried to ignore, but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin. When you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented TWO YEARS AGO and didn't start development for until the beginning of 2015, and instead just made it a hyper-powerful version of an already existing enemy (That of course is weak as a kitten if you use DLC-only explosives), that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself I was disgusted. The FBI files, a long-awaited addition to the game, turned out to be a link to Overkill's own website that plays a cute little 'Virtual machine' that shows you gun statistics, something there's already a Wiki for, as well as the character's profiles and backgrounds, something you could already see on crimenet in game. And I took a break, and figured I'd get over it eventually. I'd come back, I'd play again. I played this game to the point where I could beat Death Wish solo on loud heists, so surely I'd pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms. Right? And then Overkill lost it. The game now has CS:GO's uncrating system. They clearly noticed Gun Mettle was a huge success in Team Fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing. Small problem with this theory, however: Team Fortress 2 already had an item system, and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be. Payday had nothing of this sort, so this comes across as a blatant cash-in on an idea that worked for another game. But that's fine. Even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the I (Or the inspect animations in this instance), it worked for CS:GO, it wasn't as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in TF2, maybe it'll work for Overkill, despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons. And if that were it, I'd say 'I really hate this company but whatever' and resign myself to just playing. But no, that's not all. The weapon skins give statistical advantages. These give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins. And there's NO other way to get them, save for opening them with a  key drill, straight from the community marketplace. You HAVE to spend money, REAL money, not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation, but actual currency on your Steam account, to get these weapons, and by not shelling out extra money that already costs (Or so I've been informed, not a US resident) around 25$, you are at a disadvantage to other players who WILL do so, because Overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update TF2 did for free, which was successful because of the rebalancings. Congrats, Overkill. I know I'm not the only person you'll have heard this from, but you're true filth, and I took great pleasure in uninstalling. DON'T buy this game. All you'll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an ever-expanding list of DLC, and now apparently some pretty gun skins, or else the game is insultingly difficult (On Death Wish, all other difficulties are easy regardless, because why would 'Overkill', the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it, pose a challenge, and stealth is always easy just for what it is). The game is disgusting, and never content with the amount of cash it's sucked in, and broken beyond repair. But don't expect it to be fixed. That'll cost you extra. Brief update, significantly late: The microtransactions have been (Mostly) retracted. Whether that's enough to make amends isn't for me to decide, feel free to decide for yourself",-1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"If you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star, or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives, then this may be the game for you. Failure is the only option.  Most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet-to-planet maneuver, or how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer. No, it'll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived, but somehow did. My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface. He bounced! And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way. He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong--the only type of mission that truly exists. He fell from space! And lived! Forget space, erect a statue!  My first manned mission to the Mun ended in predictable failure. I tried landing without any sort of landing gear. How, you might ask? By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff. I forgot about my horizontal velocity, however, and ended up ripping the engine apart. I had all the fuel I needed for a return mission, but the broken engine was left kilometers away. Oops. At least I could plant a cool flag.  I attempted a rescue mission, because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do: stranded person in space? Send more people to help them! The first mission collided with the Mun at 600 m/s. Rough landing. The second mission landed, but I was probably 50km away--which isn't all that bad, all things considered. I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed ship, but it was taking forever. So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things. Lemons and lemonade. As it turns out, you can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid, like the surface of the Mun. You will forever be in our thoughts, Mac Kerman.  So much for the rescue. I may as well have the rescue team return safely. Remember that landing gear part? Yeah, I still hadn't updated that section of the ship. Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp. Bulletproof logic. At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fiery, fiery death. An honorable death. By my own hands.  In KSP, your little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous 'Lost' column. It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kerman's name in there. I didn't care so much about the other guys. Who cares about the second guy on the Mun? But here's the thing, several years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action! He came back from the dead! And what was the first thing he wanted to do? Go back into space! To die again!  In conclusion, yes to this game. Just yes. I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moon, Minmus. Yes, he is in a stable orbit without a ship. Just him. And he's been there for close to 30 years now. I'll get around to that at some point.  Update: Still in orbit.",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I score this Simulation game 12/10, just hit the buy button! It exceeds all expectations. The game isn't finished yet, but I don't care. They can't fail anything anymore. Just buy it. Or wait for a sale and then buy it. Whenever you buy it, you won't feel ripped off! I guarantee you that!   Kerbal Space Program is pure MAGIC! On the facade it comes across as something with the depth of Angry Birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled. However, there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions! There's a reason I'm scoring this game 12 out of 10. I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library. I even try NOT to play it, but when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores...  KSP, like the name might have hinted, is a Space Program Simulator Game. There is the career mode, involving missions and research, and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it. The game is in early access and the career needs work (I find the missions redundant and confusing, but it's already fun), and this review is more about the sandbox mode.  You run the show, so you set out your own missions, like fly to the moon or another planet. Then you have to build your lander, rover, satelite or whatever, the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space! Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space, you also need to learn to make an orbit. Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around. There are no concessions! By the time you've figured out how to get where you want to go, you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight! You don't need a science degree to do this and to understand this, the game is brilliant this way. You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too.  I recommend this game to all people that like simulation games, tycoon games, Lego (the plastic bricks), science fiction in general, science in general, rockets and blowing stuff up, real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn.  As you set out your own missions, you send your Kerbal individuals (they all have names) on grand adventures. Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons. The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse (really a fun and beautifull feature). In the Kerbol (name of the star) system you will also find the planets Moho, Eve with it's moon Gilly, Kerbin with Mun and Minmus, Duna with Ike, then a gas-giant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo. The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space. It may be a scaled down planetary system, but that doesn't mean it's small. I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world. Each planet and moon comes with it's own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you'll busy for hundreds of hours before you've done it all. Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother, you know what the other player is talking about.  When I started playing, I had little expectations. It looked like a mod, but then I reached space. It was like the opening of the movie 2001: a Space Oddisey. The 'space whales' ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin, ever going higher and higher, kerbin getting smaller and smaller, I passed the Mun... lost kerbin, then found the 'eva' button.. I found out stands for 'Extra Vehicular Activity', or 'Go play outside'.. so I lost my Kerbal. Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSP, while drooling over my keyboard.  This game is not done yet. I'm not sure when they aim for a release candidate, but they can't fail this anymore. Nasa has made an addon for it, so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed. Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new Space-X rocket, how awesome is that! And the developer has even announced multiplayer!!! I don't know how this will work and what we could do in an online game, and It's already more fun if a friend plays this game too, but it's anticipated by me nonetheless.   The educational value of this game is through the roof! I thought I understood the principle of orbits, but boy did I learn a lot. I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically, but putting it to practice requires more then just going. So, I watched Nasa do it. They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed, so ok... I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try-outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with. At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of 'every action has a 'pose and equal reaction' gets a whole new meaning in orbit (you'll see :KSmiley:).   Every run you make in Kerbal, you get more advanced. Your rockets become more stable, because you know how to make them, you get to other planets faster, because you know how to get there. My rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander, of which I built a new version every night, to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Duna, which took me 2 weeks to build! It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind-boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc (or the game's engine) found hard to process when launched.  There comes a point where you get stuck on something, like how to dock in space. There are several things to do, but I warn you: this can make or break your experience. Try as hard as you can if you're stuck, play with a friend (you know, together on one pc thinking and building) and if all else fails, then try youtube or a guide. Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience. But when you've reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes. I think every KSP player has posted screenshots, videos, guides both online and private to friends. The ammount of material you can dig up is staggering.  Also, don't install mods as you just start playing, exept for scan-sat perhaps (but don't, the other mods will lure you). Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy. I've reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame. I've reached the point of not getting my ships docked. This was the point where I looked on youtube, read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods, mods like MechJeb (in flight telemetry and autopilot options, use at your own risk), advanced cockpits (cockpit screens, buttons to press, external cameras, awesome!), more parts, graphical addons, scan-sat (scans planets, awesome!), etc. But with all games in early access, mods can be broken when the game is patched. But when you've reached that point, KSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities, as realistic as you want it to be.  This game is 100% quality, dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get. When it's done, it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game. With more standard parts, more physics, more career, more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now. From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I don't think this game will die out soon. Just buy the game, you'll have fun for years to come I promiss!!!  Now years after release, I stand by my review. This game will stand it's ground.

But today, when my son asked me that question (awww yis!), I simply said -- 'I'll show you how', and we fired up the game. I was able, with the help of KSP, to show my son the beauty of trial and error, the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is, and how small we are. I let him built it himself, parachutes on a moon lander, backwards engines and everything. I remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded, the look of awe as we made orbit, his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon. I remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes. Which didn't work. We crashed. Hard.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"When you play Kerbal Space Program, you find yourself becoming one of two types of individuals. Either you throw everything together and make things up as you go, or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it. Either way, mission success (whatever you define that to be) is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky (pun intended). It's very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your Kerbals (the characters that man spacecraft) has walked on the surface of another celestial body. It's also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when you've made it halfway across the Kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home.  This game will frustrate and exhilarate you. Well worth the purchase.",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"It's been quite a ride. Four long years of development, cool stuff, accidentally education, and the Kraken... and here we are. One point oh (point whatever!) And  oh,  are things different! But that's all the  past!  Let's talk about the present.  This is a game in which you go to space repeatedly, success optional.  Most of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination. You can just throw some bits together, hit the go button and see what happens! What's that? There are Kerbals in there? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device. Conversely, you can put things together in  a very particular manner  and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle. It's all up to you. Your sandbox is the solar system. Go play. Due to the nature of things and such, this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment, yet it's just as fun alone at home.  Now, for the less sandbox-oriented among us (or just the people like me who enjoy progression,) there's a  career mode!  This time, you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range, manned, ballistic missiles!  FOR SCIENCE!  Seriously, you generate  Science!  from everything, and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more  Science!  Be careful though. Don't want to blow up too many bits, because you have funding to worry about now. You should also take care of your Kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable.  Also the camera shakes, there's complicated aerodynamics, there's thermodynamics, there's moresodynamics, there's orbital mechanics, there's resource mining (which you can MAKE FUEL with,) there's management, there's pretty explosions, there's good sound effects that are also deafening, there's accidentally education, and so much more for only  some money!   However, the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating. Ignore it, fumble around for a while, and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era.  There's not really much else to talk about...

April 2015:   2000 hours and climbing, still have not run out of uniqe things to do.. theres always a crazier mission than you considered before... the mods have only gotten better, and with some tricks like running in OpenGL mode you can load this game up with ALOT of mods before it explodes. you can install Real solar system mod and play on a real life sized system, makes going to the moon and back something worth bragging about. thats for extremely advanced players as even i find it hard.  Feb 2016 - 3000 hours  Game completed, runs great on 64 bit version, now mods arent an issue and you can load it up until the cows come home. so much more stable than ever, faster than ever and every thing.

Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther.   Science: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money.   Sandbox: Like all Sandboxes.. Everything is tehre from the start, no money, science or anything else, Just build and have fun.   -------------------------------  What you do in the game is open ended. IT's your choice. Build what you want, and fly it anywhere you want (Or anywhere it can go). There are many many entire different planets to explore, moons, asteroids, etc. A fully open ended solar system.   Taking off from Kerbin, flying through the upper atmosphere, and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Truly Epic. One of those games I keep going back to (300+ hours as I write this).  Being a simulation, the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless.  My most recent Kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe (JoolStar1) was about to arrive at Jool after nearly 4 years in flight. Actually, it happened quite a while before that, I just wasn't aware of it.  I switched to the probe, ready to fine-tune my approach so I could cut through the atmosphere, bleeding off speed without wasting fuel.  Something was wrong. The probe didn't respond to inputs. That's when I realised I hadn't deployed the solar panels before leaving Kerbin orbit!   Cursing, I tried to deploy them. Nothing. I mashed the button repeatedly. Still nothing. I checked the batteries... Empty!  Since I didn't have a kerbal on board to do an EVA, there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly as JoolStar1 sailed straight past its destination, a failure destined to orbit the sun forever.  This game is all about failing repeatedly (and hilariously) until a Darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build, fly and land rockets.  I can't recommend it highly enough",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"2 things  1. The best game I have ever played.  2. SCOTT MANLEY.  I could write a 10k word essay on all the good things about this game. But I'll stick to pointing out the one thing that was both what got me hooked and would also frustrate me to the point of almost not wanting to play. The learning curve. It's the single most challenging learning experience I've had since I left uni! But I LOVED every second of it.   The absolute highlight of this game for me? When a friend and I shared a save file and flew a mission (over 2000tons of spaceship) to the planet jool with the aim of landing and every moon and then coming home. We worked on the designs together, assembled our ship in orbit together and ran the mission.   Kerbal has given me the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life... and I play a LOT of games!",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"While it's not exactly beginner-friendly, Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a brilliant game for what it achieves. What other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics, staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel? Gravity is a difficult beast to tame!  You're drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks, attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically. Once you're on the launchpad though, ♥♥♥♥ gets real. You will fail a lot, with your rocket exploding, or tipping over, or messing up the sequence of stages.  Just leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge, and that is still the early game! Sending probes and landers to other planets and moons, building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system; these are all possible. Beyond that, the Career and Science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments, and further still the Sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals.  Unless you're a genius or have a huge deal of patience you  will  need to refer to various tutorials, wikis, guides and discussions online. If physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks. You'll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game.  KSP will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th Century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time. Any person who's dreamed of working at NASA must try Kerbal Space Program.  Recommended!",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"It's not exactly rocket science is it?....oh wait, yes it is!  Kerbal Space Program is a game about building spacecraft and, unless you're very good at the game, watching them blow up which is currently in Early Access. In KSP you design and build your very own spacecraft/rockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave Kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal. With a vast array of parts at your disposable it's daunting at first, well it's daunting for a while, but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast, especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering.  KSP has four different game modes each of which I will give a brief description of.   First off there's sandbox mode. In sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away, this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works.  Next we have scientific mode. In scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places, e.g. the surface of Kerbin or low Kerbin orbit. Science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments. You begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress.  Up next is career mode. Career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about. Money is earned by completing contracts, such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane. Reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts, the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are. However, reputation can be lost through either failing contracts or losing kerbals.  Last, and probably least depending on what you like, are the game's pre-made scenarios. Ranging from tutorials on docking to the NASA redirect mission this game mode is what you would expect it to be, just different scenarios to try out, not much to say about this one.  +Graphics are pretty nice +Lots of different parts +The building menus are good and building is relatively easy, by easy I mean straightforward to use not easy to make decent vehicles +A number of different planets and moons, each with different appearances and properties +Good controls and useful hotkeys +Good staging setup +Endless possibilities of what you can make, from simple little rockets to huge spacestations in orbit around distant planets +Reasonaly good physics but not perfect (I'll get to that later) +Plentiful explosions +Huge replayability +Great modding community and adding mods is extremely easy +Kerbals are nice little race and you can get attached to the more well known kerbals quite easily (I &lt;3 Jeb)  +/-Very basic tutorials, this game really throws you in at the deep end  -Immensely steep learning curve, I'm 60+ hours in and I've only recently made it to the Mun (and successfully landed)  -The physics and controls for spaceplanes are pretty bad, spaceplanes have clearly been neglected in favour of rockets  Verdict: 9  An outstandingly good vehicle builder/sandbox game which is perfect for anyone with an interest in space, the related physcis or anyone who likes building vehicles.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Kerbal Space Program, at least to me is the king of simulation games. While I play numerous others (such as Farming Simulator) they don’t seem to hit every mark in that field. KSP, while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player, and force them to deal with it. While a game like Farming Sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops, KSP requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity, to a satellite connection back home.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"This game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game i've ever played, but it has also given me the greatest feeling of achievement from any game i've ever played.  When you land on the Mun for the first time, after mashing buttons trying to stabalise your craft and you barely make it due to the lack of fuel, there's no better feeling than knowing you have to do it all again and launch a rescue mission. (or you could just leave Bob there for science).....  I am a big fan of space, physics and science in general and playing this game has been an education for me. Because of KSP I have watched dozens of YouTube videos on astrophysics and aerodynamics I would have probably never watched without this game and learned a ton of interesting things, and i love that.  The game has a fantastic modding community with a huge variety of mods to add realism or give your game a futuristic sci-fi feel. A favourite mod of mine is 'Remote tech', I don't play without it.   This game produces some stunning visuals too as you drift through the vast openness of space, orbiting moons, chasing asteroids, collecting science and designing planes, rockets, trucks, rovers, probes, boats even helecopters and mech walker/transformer type sh** thanks to mods...

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"So i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review. Well, here i am.   So i got this game around summmer 2015, after wanting it for a long time. The game had just left early access and was in beta. (I just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game) I adore this game. Most of my summer was spent playing this. (Before you say that isn't possible, i would like to point out my hours didn't add up as I ran the game from the .exe rather than steam.)   I would, and have, recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success, science, exploration, engineering, space, cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of each-other and use them as landing gear.  The only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve. I know the 1.1 update added loads of tutorials, 'cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad, but you will spend around 5 - 10 hours before you can do anything useful. Needless to say though it is worth it, and soon you will conquer the solar system!  Or, y'know, just abuse the various bugs the game has... that's cool....  Anyway, thanks for reading this review.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"To begin, I guess I should give a short description: Essentially, KSP is a fairly realistic simulation game where you take control of and guide the nascent space program of a race of small green men and women from a planet named Kerbin. You will build your own vessels, choose your targets for exploration, colonization, scientific endeavor, etc, and blast off for space. The construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use, and, because of the level of customization available, tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike. There are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships (several mods change this if you want), but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate, and make for a, while unforgiving, very fun game, because the feedback is extremely consistent. A mistake will kill you EVERY time, unless something hilarious happens (this is actually one of the great parts of playing KSP).   I cannot say enough positive things about this game. I purchased this originally in April of 2013, before it was on steam, and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released. KSP has few goals, and in sandbox mode, it has none, but goals are not the reason to play KSP. The first time I successfully put a Kerbal in orbit around his home planet, I was dancing around my dorm room, and the first time I landed a Kerbal on the Mun, I felt a sense of accomplishment I have quite literally never felt in a game before. Now, over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play, I have built massive colonies on Laythe, the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, and even Ike, I've built huge orbital stations around various planets, and I've even built floating cities in the clouds of Jool and Eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available. I've built resource collection and transport systems including storage, mining, and transport operations. I've explored hundreds of different areas with probes, landers, and vehicles, and yet, to this day, I still play this game at least two to three hours a week, and I'll go on KSP binges several hours long when I think of a new challenge to set for myself. Currently, a friend of mine and I are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic Duna colonization project. If you can't tell by now, if you want an 'on rails' game where everything is spoonfed to you, just leave now. This game is most certainly NOT for you. The contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration.  But if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have, and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake, then KSP is your game. And when you finally put a Kerbal safely on the Mun, you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about KSP.",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"This is one of my favourite games. Its simply amazing.  KSP is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game.  Its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning, expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own. (Watch ScottManley tutorials if you want a head start)  I had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet (or keeping my rocket upright on the way there) - but now I am planing missions to other planets, landing and returning - sending unmanned rovers to explore - or even bringing asteroids back home.  800 hours in and I feel like I am still just at the beginning.  »Mün or bust« - unknown (prob.

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Kerbal Space Program version 1.0.2. I've been playing the early access game for over 2 years, but now that it became official I thought I'd write a review. My review is very positive. (But see the caveat about version 1.0 below at the bottom).  (Full disclosure: I don't work for SQUAD but I do help write one of the mods for the game, so I am personally invested in this.)  Get This Game. For once a sci-fi game that is actual sci-fi and not science fantasy. It doesn't insult the intelligence of the player, and it speculates what-if, in a relatively reasonable way, only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay, rather than breaking ALL of them constantly like most space video games do.   Kerbal Space Program as history : Although the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible (so it doesn't take as long to get things done as it really would), it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical real-world space programs. Don't be fooled by the cute derpy-looking Kerbals - you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions - space stations in low orbit, docking maneuvers, performing an Apollo-style 'Mun' landing, send rover probes to 'Duna' (which is Mars-like), and so on. All from gluing together parts and having fun.  (And if you really want to go all-out, there are user community mods out there that replace the game's solar system with the real thing, so you can really try these missions out in full size).   Kerbal Space Program as a 'tycoon' style game :  If you like the old style 'tycoon' games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects, then Kerbal Space Program Career Mode is for you. Start up a new game, pick 'career mode', set Normal or Easy difficulty (do NOT use Hard until you've played a while), and you'll have the fun of trying to balance funding (for making better space center buildings, and for making the rockets themselves), reputation (for making future offers you see be better for you), and science points (for buying your way up the tech tree). Accept contracts, and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do. Don't fail them or else you'll lose funds and rep for it.   Kerbal Space Program as a mod platform :  From it's early access days, a user community of modders has grown, such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game. As of this writing, because KSP 1.0.2 is relatively new, some of those mods won't work just yet, but they will after only a week or two. If past use is anything to go by that's about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release. As Steam is not the only means of obtaining the game, and not even the first means of obtaining it, the company, SQUAD, has chosen not to support Steam Workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make Steam-only mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on Steam. I support this decision, but it does mean you'll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them. Look up 'KSP' on  {LINK REMOVED}  curse.com  and look for  Kerbalstuff.com.  most mods are in both places.   Kerbal Space Program as 'edutainment' :  The game is quite educational, but in that good sneaky fun way, where you don't realize you're learning - you're just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way. If you've got a teenager or pre-teen at home, give this to them. It does something that is really hard to do - it *demonstrates* though gameplay how a mathematical concept works, visually, without revealing the actual formulas, in such a way that the hard math can come *after* the intuitive understanding. Usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and 'feel' can't happen until *after* you understand the numbers. But here, it lets you play with the phenomenon first, and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you, rather than the other way around.  Get. This. Game.   A caveat:   My review refers to the 1.0.2 version of KSP and emphatically NOT to the 1.0 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical re-entry bug. Had I written the review about the 1.0 version, it would not have been as kind. The 1.0 release was rushed by about a week. The 1.0.2 release from a week later was MUCH better, and is probably what should have been the 1.0 release.  R.E. The KSP 1.0 re-entry bug: You may read reviews by people complaining about re-entry being broken when 1.0 game out. Those reviews weren't wrong *at the time* they were written. KSP 1.0 was rushed out with a re-entry bug that was very unfair, and importantly, really obvious so it's hard to imagine how they missed it. Adding a heat shield actually *caused* the ship to blow up on re-entry because adding it made the vessel flip nose-first, rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part. If you see reviews complaining about this behavior, be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version.  ",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I've only had this game for a month and I've already logged over 50 hours into it. Kerbal Space Program is NOT simply a game about building rockets, launching them, and seeing where they go. Its tagline is 'Conquering Space Was Never This Easy', and that is true, it is easy, compared to doing it in real life. But don't let it fool you- KSP actually has a pretty steep learning curve. In the month that I've had this game, I've only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of Kerbin (KSP's version of Earth). I haven't even gotten to a single moon or other planet. But don't let that deter you. Look up tutorials for the game (Side note- The in-game tutorials are actually pretty terrible. I recommend finding ones online, such as Scott Manley's, who does a great job of explaining how the game works).

In KSP, you ♥♥♥♥ up. The fun part is thinking of ridiculous plans to un-♥♥♥♥ up.",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"I bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it. I've played KSP off an on for a few years. The game has a very active mod-making fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play. My best review of this game is anecdotal. (I sent this to a friend when I was only a few hours into play. I had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics. Anyone who plays KSP might find this story relatable.)  'One of my test flights put 3 Kerbals into orbit. They were low on fuel so I did a retrograde burn to bring them home. Except that I didn't do a retrograde burn, I did a prograde burn. By the time I realized it, I had burned too much fuel to get them home. I reduced their orbit as much as possible, even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters. They were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point. With no way to return to the surface under their own power, I had one option; a rescue mission.  I built a new ship, one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which I dubbed 'Lost Eagle.' Lost Eagle had been fitted with docking collar and I guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort. The rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue. The final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for it's relatively low weight. This would end up being the ultimate design flaw. It was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members, and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before re-entry.   Docking is hard. I would say impossible but I've seen videos of people doing it and I know it can be done. But despite many hours and multiple misses. I had got Rescue 1 and Lost Eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away. I closed enough distance that I felt it would be close enough to 'jump.'  The first crew member from Lost Eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one. It went pretty smoothly, but in the process the ships drifted further apart. I did a corrective burn on Rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member. Success again. 1 left. He jumped, this time from the furthest gap. He too arrived successfully. I felt a rush of success, a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in today's video games. Plenty of fuel for the retro burn. They were coming home. This process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while.  The design of the re-entry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip. She wasn't pretty, but she was light and efficient. The plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere, but I had discovered that I couldn't deploy the parachutes from the re-entry craft. It was a problem I had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but I was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit. The whole thing still landed successfully in my tests.  At 5000m above the surface, having survived re-entry. I pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes. I don't know if I double tapped it or if I had just had my staging backwards, but when I hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can. Knowing full well that there was nothing I could do to save the pilot of Rescue 1 I watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival. I quickly switched to the other part of the ship. I tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them. The hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs. No controls that could be used to deploy the chutes. Again I watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom, the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second.   The game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission, or even the assembly area where I could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals. I chose not to. I was angry at myself for the mistake. I had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what I knew was a flawed design. The empty ship, Lost Eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any Kerbal that looks up, that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results. I will be reminded of this every time I play the game.'  ",1,1

Note my play time does NOT include the 50-100 hours I put in before the game was ever on Steam.  Simply one of the best products in the last decade, KSP is not your typical 'game'. It's a software toy. You tinker. You experiment. You adjust. You tweak. And you have a grand time doing it. KSP is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a super-deluxe space rocket that can go to the Mun or Eve with ease. If it did that KSP would not be any fun. Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam.   Instead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions. You'll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit. You'll pump your fist when you land on the Mun for the first time. And you'll continue having fun.  What are you waiting for? Go buy it!",1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"'Kerbin, We have a problem...'   -Bill Kerman in the command pod next to Jeb, who opened the hatch during re-entry.    First of all, I played this game for a LONG time, way before the 1.0 release (not on steam, no)  To be honest, the is probably the best game I ever played in my whole life. I mean, I'm an astronomy nerd for almost 9 years and trust me... This is real space travelling. This game will entertain you for the rest of your life and if you like astronomy/airplanes or looking at a star during night at all, this game can't go wrong. This game allows you to play in 3 different modes and the ultimate goal is to explore different bodies and complete researches. However, the 3 different levels has their own way of fun too. So, the basic mechanic of the game is you put together a craft in ANYWAY you want and with ANY PARTS you want! Then, you do the calculations for a specific mission (or not). They you fly it! You can build a plane and fly around, or build a rocket to go visit the different planets and the moons in the system! You can actually do anything you want in the game, capture and asteriod, dock to make a station or go mining on the Mun. So, learn REAL rocket science by starting this game!  Now...  11/10 would complete a Jool all-moon landing mission and forget to bring parachute when going back to kerbin 12/10 would attach a solid booster to a VTOL 13/10 would unorbit a space station that I built for 10 month just to see the solar panels snap 14/10 would spend 200 hours of the game calculating and design a ship so that it will glich through Jool 15/10 would spend 2 hours trying to make a kerbal dance on the Narrow-Band Scanner (you can do that) 16/10 would blast a kerbal with a kerbodyne engine to let it fly  17/10 would script edit and make the sperators have 10,000,000 ejection force and name it 'velocity injector' 18/10 would slingshot around all the moons in Jool and glich through Jool, launching yourself at 5,144,255,345m/s 19/10 would build an aircraft carrier then attach a F22 to it and build a aircraft catapult using the 'velocity injector' (it crashed, the plane, not the game!) 20/10 would 9/11 the VA... I mean nothing  21/10 will play kerbal for the rest of my life!  Now, with the new update of 1.2, new communication networks and etc. The game got even better and even cheaper! So, with the 1.2 update, IT'S WORTH YOUR 23 BUCKS! And I think I made myself LOUD AND CLEAR!  haha... okay... get it?",1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,"You know, when I first saw this game way back in early access, I thought, 'Cartoony, throw away game, not worth the effort.' But, then I researched a little, and watched a couple of episodes on youtube detailing game play.  I was more than intrigued. I bought the game in what was called early access beta, but it was already pretty polished. I think that was in versions .6 or so?   I became OK and landed on Mun and Minimus several times. Many, many times, actually, and maxed out science just by going to Mun and Minimus and getting every biome.  But, then I set the game aside. I didn't want to be burned out on it before it actually left Beta. I recently returned and almost ragequit. Many things have changed. Everything I thought I knew, I had either forgotten or didn't work anymore.   I have played it a lot the last few days. I have had a lot of successes and a lot of failures, but I am essentially back to where I was before I quit. The learning curve is pretty steep. Do you want to just fly out of the atmosphere? Fairly easy to figure out. Do you want to fly to one of the moons, land, and then take off with the expectation of getting back to Kerbin (Kerbal's Earth)? It's going to take a lot more knowledge.  I do recommend this game, but I have to agree with someone else. Unless you're an engineer by nature, you're probably going to need help at some point, because this game is not a child's game. It is tough, but rewarding.  I try not to look at too much on youtube because I don't want to spoil it for myself, but I am to the point that it is going to take a drastic rethinking of what I'm doing, or I am going to need to watch tutorials to get anywhere out of Kerbin's orbit and get back safely. I sent an unmanned probe to Duna (basically Kerbin's Mars). I was not able to bring it back. Thankfully, no Kerbals were killed on that adventure.  Yes, I'd say get this game. If you see it on sale, then grab it immediately. I guess I have put 170 hours in to it. I'll probably put thousands into it before it is all over.",1,1

The game also gives you a far better appreciation of the difficulties, challenges and indeed triumphs of actual space programs, past and present. From various types of custom built rockets, space planes, space stations, and installations on other worlds that can be constructed, Kerbal reminds us how good games can be, and is a game that will definitely not leave you disappointed and keep you coming back for more and more, as the amount of sleep you get dwindles away.",1,0

222880,Insurgency, Insurgency,1,1
222880,Insurgency,"This game looks so awesome and challanging. NO SPOTTING, NO HIP-FIRE CROSHAIR NO MINIMAP, NO KILLCAM, NO HEALTH METER, NO HIT /KILL NOTIFICATION, NOT EVEN AN AMMO COUNTER. it really forces you to trust your instincts and your teamates due to the lack of information. It feels so rewarding to confirm a kill or win a game.﻿",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is a strange animal - a blend of various ideas characterized by other games like Counter-Strike, Red Orchestra, and the cult classic Firearms mod - that manages to do a very good job at providing a tactical, hardcore shooter experience.  On paper, Insurgency seems very normal - two teams, the classic push/conquest/objective style game types, and guns. However, that's pretty much all Insurgency has in common with its modern military shooter bretheren. Insurgency is mechanically a very different beast. Let's start with spawns - instead of having reinforcement pools like Battlefield or Red Orchestra, Insurgency uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow. It sounds weird, sure, but it works extremely well in practice.   Let's take a basic game mode, Skirmish. Five objective points, conquest style. Each team's closest points to defend are objectives that can be destroyed, which removes them from the map and tightens up the cap order. Each team starts with 2 spawn waves. These spawn waves kick in every 60 seconds or so. Anyone alive by then stays alive, anyone dead by the end of this timer comes back. Every time an objective is captured, another spawn wave is added to the capping team. This means that players are not only incentivized to do objectives in order to extend their own playtime, but it also increases the team's overall effectiveness. It also means that rounds can take a while or be over extremely quickly depending on the degree of teamwork and individual player ability to stay alive.  The other thing that this game does very well mechanically is its gunfights. In other tactical realism games like Red Orchestra or ARMA, an average engagement is a sniper fest - whoever sees 'em first ends it pretty much instantly. Now don't get me wrong, Insurgency has its share of ingloriously quick deaths and sniping corridors, but an average medium-range gunbattle can often devolve into a stand-up fight involving suppression, repositioning, and grenades, much like a real fight. Part of this is enabled by the fantastic sound design and particle effects - guns are spectacularly loud, a blinding amount of smoke and dust gets kicked up from fully automatic fire, and suppression effects seriously mess with a player's accuracy. Ducking away from a window to have a burst of automatic fire rip up where you were just seconds ago is quite unnerving. Insurgency also seems to be one of the few games that really understands that shooting a real firearm often results in a sort of almost-blindness from the muzzle blast and recoil, which makes attempting to shoot enemies less of a 'line-up-and-click' moment and more of 'frantically fire in their general direction and hope they don't shoot back'. tl;dr: the guns feel realistic and meaty, and getting shot at is freaky.  With that said, however, I must be clear with you - Insurgency is NOT a game attempting infantry combat simulation like ARMA or Red Orchestra. The accuracy and damage dealt by the game's large selection of weapons is on par with those kinds of games, but this is also a game tuned for balance and fun. There isn't any superflous mechanics like changing the zeroing on your ironsights or wounding (like RO2 does), but it does make thematic concessions, like fully animated fire selector switches. The inventory and loadout system also emphasizes that it's still very much a game . The end of rounds gives your team Supply Points, which you can then use to build your character's weapons kit. You can equip armor to hopefully increase your survivability by a shot or two, attach a 4x scope to your SKS to plink at range with it, or shunt your points into a slow-handling rocket launcher, which is good for objectives and heavy suppression. There is no grindy metagame progression system like Call of Duty. It's just the loadout and inventory - all based on your team's performance in and out of rounds. Kind of like Counter-Strike!  As someone who cut their teeth on games like Red Orchestra, I can say this about Insurgency: it is NOT the most hardcore, realistic shooter I've played, but it is most definitely the most FUN I've had with a realistic team-based shooter! For an early access game, they have a very good product released as of this date (12/29/13). I haven't had a single crash yet, it looks amazing, and runs like a dream! They also have quite a selection of maps and well-balanced gameplay to top it all off. If what I've said sounds good at all to you, go on and get this game, even if it isn't on sale. It's worth it.",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"One of the best FPS game I have ever played. It's more realistic than Counter Strike, but not as hardcore as Arma. By default, there are no health bars, no ammo indicators, no crosshairs and no kill messages. Kill messages can be toggled on by the server.  Enemies drop quick in this game if you're using AP rounds; usually in 1-2 shots. The 'sniper guns' (M14,FAL, M40A1, Mosin) will kill in one shot with AP ammo, even if the target has heavy armor. All guns will kill with one shot to the head. Most bullets that are able to pass through a wall, will retain enough energy to kill someone in one shot to the head. Guns shoot straight, you don't get an unrealistic spread cone like Counter Strike and shotguns are still lethal long range using slugs. Suppressive fire exists and it's tactical. However, there is no bullet drop at all. Teamwork, heavy armor and being tactical wins the game.   This game also has a better community and less 12 year olds than most FPS games such as Counter Strike and Call of Duty.   The best gamemode and the one I play most often is Ambush.   Even though I got this game for 25 cents ($1 for a 4 pack in a humble bundle). It is worth the $15 in its entirety.   I highly recommend this game.",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"I decided to hold off on writing a review until there were a few more updates and for me to have at least 500+ hours invested into the game. I am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff. Short and sweet.  Should you get it? It depends on what type of fps's you like. Many CS players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and they've grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have. Don't doubt it for a second, this game is hard to pick up on but once you do, you realize how well reflexes really help if you're rushing but don't expect to be 360 no-scoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen. Those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe (just don't be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything). There are few grenade, C4, or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating, so that is why I'm really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and don't feel as constrained/guided (Heights and Buhriz are like that but i still love them). Maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great. The devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps, always on top of it so kudos to them.   Community engagement is stronger than i've ever seen it, there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of The Digital Gaming League is starting their first official Insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up.   The Nightfall update just added so much more to the game, it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible. Noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning, leaning mechanic feels more 'stiff' (meaning not fluidly unnatural), the night vision is spot on and well-balanced, flares look awesome in the night sky, but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now, i preffered it the way it was before but i won't nit-pick things for the sake of the length of this review. Also the new co-op survival is an amazing idea, i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends.   I could write a list of 10,000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself. It needs to be experienced, the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something. Kills are rewarding, objectives are highly valued, teamwork is vital. You need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter!  *12/20/14 edited formatting*  NEW UPDATE! 5/3/16  1,290 hours logged, i just can't seem to get enough. New maps, improvements, feautures, etc. OH and a new Insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea! Community is growing steadily, a lot more Pick Up Games (PUG's) than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive. My only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked. The future of Insurgency is looking very healthy!",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"TL;DR: Rainbow Six + Red Orchestra + a bit of Counter-Strike and a sprinkle of attachments like Battlefield but without dumb unlocks. A solid tactical shooter with a slow pace and punishing time-to-kill where a few bullets will take you down.   Insurgency is Rainbow Six in Iraq with lots of sudden death and PTSD and jumping because you're shot out of nowhere. It's a game of hide-and-seek with laser sights betraying their owner's position and footsteps betraying your own position. Imagine if Red Orchestra had a baby with Rainbow Six. It's got a lot of that in its blood. In fact, one of the original devs for RO is the guy behind Insurgency. Now, the hypothetical RainbowOrchestra child was raised by Counter-Strike. Some round-based game modes and not all of them have respawns without some major coordination.   It's a tense package where you might go with no kills or a lot, depending on how well you can plan ahead with your teammates because if you don't get the drop on your enemies, you're dead before the bullets leave the chamber. If you liked the mod, you'll like this. If you like Red Orch but in the scale of the older Rainbow Six games, you'll like this.   On a scale of 20, I give it three thumbs up and -25% off coupon to a medium 2-topping pizza at participating locations. Would recommend.",1,0
222880,Insurgency,"I started playing Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat many, many years ago as a mod. As soon as I heard they were making a standalone, I bought it without thinking twice.

This is the best mindset a developer could have, and it shows. Even though the kickstarter for Insurgency failed, the developers managed to keep it alive long enough to enter early access on steam. Their dedication to this game is really amazing.   The game has a minimal HUD, meaning your screen isn't cluttered up with useless things, such as a minimap. They also implemented a 3D VOIP system that allows you to hear anyone, including the enemy, at a realistic distance. If you decide to talk to a squad member over the radio and an enemy just so happens to be on the other side of a doorway, god bless. It requires a good amount of teamwork and communication in order to win.   There are a large amount of original game modes. Some of these modes were taken directly from the mod (such as Push), and some are brand new (Ambush). All of the game modes are original, and are mostly based off of capturing points, rather than getting kills.   One of the main problems I had with Red Orchesta 2 was the super clunky movement controls. This game has very smooth controls, but still manages to keep it medium paced. You will find it necessary to rush a corner sometimes, and other times you may need to wait for the enemy to move up. Running and gunning in this game is very, very hard to do.    When Insurgency was released from early access, the developers decided that it was in their best interest to LOWER THE PRICE. Read that sentence again. Usually, games that come out of early access RAISE their prices, but the developers of Insurgency decided to cut the price down and increase the playerbase. If that's not dedicated, I don't know what is.    This game is easily up there with the $60 games, and you can get it for 15 bucks or less. I have played over 600 hours, and I loved every minute.",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"Red Orchestra: Modern Warfare. The gunplay is amazing: I never thought that such detailed recoil and bullet penetration are possible on Source.   If that alone is not enough for you, here is why you should buy it:   *  Game is under active development. The version I bought in August and what I have at December are different. It feels like it's a sequel already: map design, ui, gameplay, sounds - everything evolved and changed in a positive way. And developers are not afraid of hotfixes. That's how you do an Early Access.    *  The sound. If you have good sound card and speakers/headphones setup, you'll hear one of the best gunshots sounds. At Least the best I ever heard. Yes, it's better than War Tapes settings for BF:BC2 or BF3. While it's not yet enabled for all maps, ones like District are just a joy to listen in 5.1.    *  The weapon handling is very well done. It feels like the real thing, it looks like the real thing, it kills. Like the real thing. Attachments are done right too. You don't consider them like an upgrades, they are to change weapon behavior in a special way. Most of the time I'm using the gun in plain ironsight mode because it fit my play style more.    *  Contains 5 different game modes for each map, like Skirmish from the original mod, all classic team deathmatch, Firefight (last team standing), VIP escort and everyone's favorite Push (aka Rush, aka attack-defense).",1,0

222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is a HARDCORE FPS at its finest which doesn't follow current FPS trend. The game strips you of most realism shooter mechanics such as a cross hair and simply says hunt or survive. From my point of view it combines all the best features of Counter Strike , Red Orchestra and Arma. This game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where you've been shot from, it doesn't take many shots to kill - fewer from the neck up - and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate, and also where the objectives are. That's it! No radar either, which makes the game even more involving. And friendly fire is always on at any time and it is forgivable. However, I would not recommend this game to people who ONLY like really arcadey shooters like CoD and BF since these two are really casual comparing with Insurgency. But if you really try to explore this game, well I would say you may find much more teamwork and strategies here. What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates. I haven’t seen a game like Insurgency for a long time(except for CS:GO), We need more games like Insurgency, and less of the CoD Advanced Bulls**t that we are overwhelmed with nowadays. This is a game will never disapoint you .",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"A overall amazing game, has potential to compete with shooters like CS:GO, Battlefield and even Arma to some extent.  Gun mechanics are finally a break from the 'you have 90 bullets in your ar-15 and they magically go in your mag when reloading'.  Some quality-of-life and realism improvements/Things I'd like to see: -More guns -More character interaction (the character voice interaction is A1 in this game) -Surpression being more useful (making your screen a little bit blurry doesnt do that much. Especially support classes would benefit from this, as their main role is to lay down surpression fire over long distances. Maybe make it so if you get surpressed, you start to yell more, giving away your position, and maybe being more innacurate) -Guns don't come out of the scope, ffs. -Maybe make it so, when you are being surpressed or in adrenaline rush, you reload faster or something? -When you aim down sights while standing for too long, your hands get tired and your sights/scopes start to sway (depending on gun weight. (This will help against rpg's maybe?) -Clips for Mosin? -More voice interaction -Make it so when you are in need to switch to your handgun/get a grenade you can drop your weapon instead of holsting it then slowly taking out your throwable/gun. Maybe we will see inclusion of shoulder gun belts? -More voice interaction please  Overall, I rate this game 8.9/10   Also, props to /k/ for suggestions  EDIT:  -Guns are noisy as ♥♥♥♥ in real life, especially LMG's, sniper rifles and shotguns indoors. If you keep spamming that LMB you will probably get some ear disease. Add earpro as a accessory. This will also make surpressors more useful (by the way, surpressors DON'T make the gun go 'phoosh'. They're still loud). -Make going prone faster, like plunching yourself on your belly, when getting fired at -Muzzle flashes are a big deal when shooting at night.  EDIT 2: -Add a .357 revolver that you can load either .357 rounds or .38spc rounds (obviously, the 357rounds will do more damage but will kick a lot more, and the .38spc rounds will have much less recoil (due to the low power and gun weight) but will damage less, making it a good hit-and-run weapon maybe? -Maybe add so you can adjust grain ammount in bullets, maybe make a Hollow point +P abomination rifle that will one-shot unarmored opponents?",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"You dash toward the corner, barely escaping a rain of bullets down the hallway, mowing down your teammates in front of you. You take a second to adjust your position, then quickly peek around the corner and unloaded a burst of AK rounds into that barely conceivable shadow of the enemy behind the counter in the dark room.  You go flank alone, sneak into the next room and see three enemies' back facing you. You swore under your breath that you didn't spend a few points on a suppressor, take a deep breath to stop yourself from panicing out and shooting uncontrollably, then fire a short quick burst into each of their asses before they realize what's happening.  As you charge toward the bomb site, you literally run into an enemy. Both of you freak out and started blind-fire, your gun start to shake as his bullests thunder by and your vision turns blurry from his muzzle blast, but you get lucky and managed to knock him down before he gets to it first.  You're sure the sound of that shot came from above that giant rock in front of you. You kneel down, slowly and surely move up the gravel slope, trying to cover every angle in front of you without making any sound. As you climb to the top, you look around carefully and finally see that sniper bellying behind that bush, his giant boots betraying his position. You smirk, switch to your knife and sink the blade deeply into his exposed butt.  =======  Those are all real Insurgency moments I had during the beta. Long time Insurgency player since the original mod, and dare I say that Insurgency is the best infantry combat game out there. It's slightly arcady in the sense that you don't need to learn 25,000 key mappings to do things down to knee-jerking. It's realistic in the sense that your HUD is stripped down to minimal which means, one, you actually have to look hard to tell what you're shooting; two, your view is super clear for you to do so.  Insurgency managed to explain the term 'firefight' in the purest form. On smaller, Tactical game modes, you'll see players break into small groups or single out, followed by short gunfights breaking out across the map. On larger, Sustained game modes, it's common to see many players grouping up, taking points, pushing and holding for objectives while exchanging franantic automatic fire.  Those adrenalin rushes. Oh, so good.",1,0
222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is relatively realistic. It looks like a Ken Burns documentary compared to Call of Duty’s and Battlefield’s more Hollywood approach. For one thing, your screen isn’t filled with information. You have no health bar, no compass, no map, and no aiming reticule. Flashy text doesn’t congratulate you after every kill.Without it, Insurgency looks cleaner and more authentic than its peers, letting you focus on strategy and action instead of keeping track of an enemy’s location on a minimap in the corner of the screen.Insurgency also doesn’t have a lot of the flash you see in modern shooters.At first glance, you’ll want to compare Insurgency to Counter-Strike. Both are competitive, team-based shooters that pit terrorists against counter-terrorist forces, but the two play differently. While you only get one life per a round of Counter-Strike, most game modes in Insurgency permit you to revive your entire team if you complete an objective, like capturing a certain point on the map or destroying a weapon cache.This dynamic provides for some fun comebacks.Insurgency offers roles like demotion, sniper, and recon, but you can’t necessarily be whatever you want. Each match offers a set number of slots for each class. The available loadouts change depending on the map and mode you’re playing. Since Insurgency is so much more realistic than most shooters, it’s also a good deal more complicated and less forgiving.Also, you won’t find any sort of training or single-player mode, so your only option if you want to improve is to jump into some online matches and suffer through some punishment. Insurgency was originally a Source-based mod, but this standalone release still uses the almost 10-year-old game engine. As a result, Insurgency isn’t the most-detailed game, with a lot of textures looking flat and dated. Ultimately, Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay. The action is highly competitive and focused.Sure, it doesn’t have the flash that most shooters proudly throw at your face these days, but Insurgency’s quieter, more realistic, and tenser take on modern warfare deserves a look, especially if you’re tired of instant knife kills and exploding buildings.",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency  Scroll to bottom for a quick Summary   What is Insurgency? A tactical first person shooter that emphasis on communication and strategy. Made with the source engine this game may not look pretty but for the gameplay it really doesn't need to.  The gameplay is not for the rambo's of the community, what I mean by saying that is you cannot rush in guns blazing, the hp in this game makes most deaths near to instant. This makes the pace of alot more rythmic and steady, forcing you to check that corner , make sure the objectives are clear etc.   This by no means makes your ability to aim any less important, the game being focused on realism makes weapons with heavy recoil and bright muzzle flashes.   There is no killing based objective mode in Insurgency, each mode is heavily objective based forcing you to work with your team to capture the objective, each team has a certain ammount of waves that determine the games length, so those more intent on fragging are still aiding the team.  Unfortunately some game modes are fairly boring and some are completely unbalanced for certain sides.  Co-op A really big feature of this game, up to 8 people per map can work your way through a series of modes that will test your skill and communication against bots that really do live up to the 'Brutal' difficulty. There are no mistakes Failure when your whole team dies, you can respawn your team when an objective is captured, Coop is a really enjoyable addition, just as challenging and popular as multiplayer it will keep you on your toes constantly.   The game is altogether alot of fun and for alot of people there is a good chance that this will become a regular pasttime of yours.  Graphics - 4/10  + Really catches the atmosphere + Workshop support can upgrade some aspects  -Source engine really shows its age -Lots of textures are repeated -Not clear what objects have different levels of bullet penetration   Gameplay - 7/10  +Really fun teamwork based  +You are forced to play the role you pick to a degree +Workshop can add alot of fun additions + Maps are well made and most are well balanced +Leaderboards and Mvp Displays really give you a sense of achievement and encourage competition +Coop is really good +Night maps make for a nice change and add whole new elements to the game +Great sound and immersion +A different way to approach most situations   -Some game modes sadly require blatant camping -Some game modes are very unbalanced -Some guns are wildly underpowered or overpowered -Workshop allows performance enhancing addons (Clearer sights , player models, etc ) -Anti Cheat is lacking -Connection to steam servers can be dodgy  Overall 6/10  Agree or disagree with something in the review?

222880,Insurgency,"My friend told me this game looked like Call of Duty. I laughed. Then, I did what any reasonable person would do. Pulling out a claymore, I screamed ALLAHU AKBAR at the top of my lungs as I sacrificed myself for Allah and wiped his ignorant face off the planet.  Actual review:  Boy, did I hate this game when I first got it. Looks like a fast paced shooter, right? I downloaded it, deciding that it would be something new, maybe similar to CS:GO. I enter my first game, and get a sniper. I'm a pretty good AWPer in CS:GO, so why not try sniping. I run out of spawn... hmm... this is weird. The running feels like I'm actually running, the movement is crisp... I was loving the game already! A smile crosses my face as I see someone all the way across the map: a target! Focused, I scoped in. I lined my crosshairs onto his head, and... WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU- My body collapses. I am dead. Who killed me? What the butt just happened? I shake my head. This life will be different. I run outside, and, long story short, die. An hour later, I have killed 3 people, and died... around 50 times.  What was I expecting? A fast-paced, 420 blaze it MLG game. What did I get? A slow-paced, gritty, realistic, EXTREMELY TEAMWORK-BASED tactical shooter that makes you think before every action. And to be honest, that's what made the game so much better for me. It's different, it's unique, and it's rewarding. Kills fill you with pride; you realize that you're actually DOING something. The other team doesn't have infinite respawns, so you just contributed to victory. This feeling of being a part of team and capturing points makes this game like no other.  Buy this game, and play it with friends. Your first hour or two will be brutal, and you will die constantly, but once you figure out what you're doing, this truly is amazing.  I know most people aren't going to read the long text I have above, so below I have a pros/cons list... Because that's all people look for in reviews anyways...  PROS: Very realistic Teamwork-oriented Extremely fun with friends Mods allow you to change your game UI/looks/music Seriously, I have the 'Murica, F*** YEAH!' music playing at the start of my rounds' and my knife is just a spatula Rewarding Unique, different shooter experience Indie devs that listen to their community, and even promote some of the modders Lots of updates Many different maps and game modes Very polished for an Early Access Very few hackers  CONS: bullet drop not possible with Source Engine (not too important, but detracts from realism if they ever add maps large enough for this to matter) Very frustrating to get into Like seriously... VERY frustrating I'm not joking... I still suck HARDCORE at the game, and I've spent quite a few hours in it... Default setting allows you to join empty servers (very insignificant, but a little annoying sometimes)  'Competitive' matchmaking needs LOTS of work; people leave randomly with no punishment, and games are reset without warning. Also, the use of voice chat is not promoted enough; in CSGO, people use voice chat because there is a clear objective that everyone strives for. In Insurgency competitive, people split up at round start to do their own thing, and there doesn't seem to be any sort of actual competitive gameplay happening. Part of this is lack of an actual objective. Sure, you're supposed to capture points, but that's a lot less defined and concrete than in CSGO, where you have to plant/diffuse the bomb. Lack of a clear, defined, INTERESTING objective makes people less inclined to care enough about the game to talk and strategize with each other.  Game has a few bugs here and there, but is EA",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"This game is basic. Or, rather, all about the basics. It's you. It's your gun. It's your team. It's the enemy.  There are no health bars, no kill streaks, no indicator on how many enemies are down, or if you did or did not kill someone. It's simply about trying to best your opponent. As someone who leads a team of over 30 players into the field, lemme give you a piece of advice. Learn the maps. Knowing where your enemies are most likely to be expected will win, or loose the game for you. Coordinate with your team, this is one of the games where the VoIP feature is realoly an asset instead of a nuisance. Sound is important - listen to the footsteps around you. Maybe one of the enemy team is distracted enough to call his teammates on the radio close to you, enabling you to hear their strategies. Find the balance between being aggressive, or waiting for an enemy's failure - One shot can and will often mean your death, but being too slow can mean inevitable defeat.   If you're not that much into the PvP high pressure aspect, however, this game also features an extensive CoOp-mode with five (!) different modes and loads of servers out there.   If you will, please trust someone who spent over 300 hours into INSURGENCY: This game, although extremely cheap, can rival every single triple-A title in terms of content, with the only disadvantage being the game's somewhat inferior graphics (Source Engine) and a lack of a real Ladder or Ranked-system.  Just, don't expect to be instantly rewarded for kills like in CoD, in BF or even in CS:GO. Killing someone is fine. But at the end of the day, You Are A Team. And you will Win Or Fall as a team.",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"Wow... just wow. I've been told this game is just a standalone upgrade of the Source Insurgency Mod and I'm very sad face that I missed that gem. Hands down the best infantry game(not too sim not too arcadey) I've ever seen / played. It still runs on the Source engine so you won't be see amazing graphics but the upside is that the source engine can run on a potato so you can still run 200+ fps with ease (in case you want to take advantage of the client speed being slightly faster with higher fps even though your monitor won't render past the 60/120 refresh rate).  Interface wise, It's the closest thing to minimally immersive that I've seen in a shooter. You get the basic UI showing what points are capped, your fire mode on your weapon, and how many magazines you have left (It won't show you current ammo so you have to estimate how much you have fired from the current mag). The weapons you carry will appear in the fade-out box only when you switch weapons like usual. No minimap showing you where the enemies or your teammates are so you have to figure it out for yourself, be it the bullets flying by to clock your enemies position, or calling out through voip to make sure no friendly fire happens when you cross flanks. There is a label on your teammates to give you that little help in deciding who is friendly though if you pay attention (hopefully they will add a server option to disable this).  The bullet count is even realistic, which so many other shooters try to simplify. The magazines left are just that, magazines. There is no magical extra pouch that you dump the unused rounds to somehow top off the last mag you have, so you have to decide if you want to top off or risk running out of rounds mid firefight, although for some reason you get an absurd amount of spare mags. The mags you replaced without being empty will actually go the bottom of your stash, then when you get to them you end up shooting like 2 rounds then having to switch mags again. Kind of annoying but kind of an awesome way to use up the unspent rounds when you are low on ammo.  Now I'm not a fan of free-aim (where your gun isn't locked in place on the center of the screen) but it fits so perfectly in this kind of game. It isn't overly done like in RO2's full screen free-aim, there is a deadzone that will free-aim, then turn when you reach the edges. It will force you to ADS (also not a fan of in other games) if you need the accuracy, which also isn't ridiculously instant like in other action shooters(visual delay only); and the movement in ADS mode will actually sway instead of snap making OP drag shot a little less potent. The free-aim deadzone is pretty realistic, giving you realistic accuracy, and rewarding you for instinct shooting from high ready. There is also emphasis on crouching in front of teammates so you don't get shot in the back, prone to get better cover, or even feigh death behind cover (there is no kill confirmation). The realism really has a Red Orchestra feel to it but in a modern setting.  The respawn system really makes you value your life because anyone who dies won't respawn until your team has captured a point or the next wave comes in sustained mode, which also encourages grouping up instead of just running, gunning, and dieing. So the gameplay may seem slow at first because of this but that all changes when you get into a fire-fight. From calling out where enemies are, to staying behind cover and watching bullets wiz past your head. You really feel like you are in the thick of it. The maps are extremely well made, there are multiple places you can fire from (lots of buildings with windows and cover) and encourage teamplay even more with a common tactic being team A advances while team B covers and suppress fire or throw smoke to rush. The maps can feel a bit asymmetrical but this is infantry realism, you are not always going to be on equal terms.  Recommended that you have a mic on the ready because the VOIP is pretty crucial in communication. It's somewhat positional audio so it's easier to tell who is talking just by the direction of the voice; but beware, enemies can hear you too if you are too close to them, positional audio is just that. It will also help when flanking, calling it out so you don't get murdered by your own team when you come around a corner.  Also, don't expect neglectful devs. The devs for this game are very involved and determined to make this game happen. I've even run into a few devs while playing and constantly responding to forum posts, so it's not like they are going to easily give up on a game they actually play.",1,0

222880,Insurgency,"&gt;Be me, playing Insurgency. &gt;I decide to download Day of Infamy (the mod for Insurgency). &gt;Join a game. &gt;A while later I'm on the German team as a Machine Gunner. &gt;Entire team is awesome. One of them is a sniper pro (Let's call him Swagger) who constantly dies by rockets (one of the rockets landed right next to me. I survived, he died and he was further away) and we had it as some sort of gag. We become good pals for the game. &gt;Fast forward to near end of game. &gt;It was a close match, but eventually Americans push us backwards so we have to protect our last point. &gt;One by one, my team dies with no reinforcement waves left. &gt;Swagger shot me with his pistol as a joke. &gt;He gets penalized and dies. Poor Swagger. &gt;We start hiding.

222880,Insurgency,"Some people just haven't experienced FPS. Realism?.........Some people are wanting this nowadays. If you are one of those hardcore, patient, tactical and competitive FPS players, Insurgency can tide you over. I wouldn't believe it is quite as addicting as your typical shooter, but you will be more satisfied, I promise you. And this game would be one of my closest FPS titles to Realism. This game will punish you to an extent where waiting and peaking around a corner can be more satisfying then doing the same old stabby stabby in TF2. This game runs fine while also having decent graphics. The lack of UI....The fact that reloading isn't automatic.....The crazy recoil....The Slow Pace........All those make this game good, rather than bad. Of course though, when I write this, the game would have still been in Beta so many things are subject to change. I wonder why this game isn't as popular as it should be. Realism? This is the closest your gonna get.  Edit: From the dramatic changes from Beta to release, the pace and overall game has become more mobile and more arcade-like, comparing to the experience in beta.",1,0

222880,Insurgency,  Basic Information,1,1
222880,Insurgency,"INSURGENCY!  Insurgency is a FPS hardcore tactial shooter, there is no campaign - meaning that all the attention is on multiplayer. There are two teams that are pitted against each other, Sercurity Forces (US) and Insurgents (Middle - Eastern extremist). There are a multitude of very enjoyable maps, some take place in day and some in night - making the flashlight a viable option. The game does a many things very well, the game is extremely realilistic in the sense that; 1-2 shots will kill, (please be careful!). Your gun will also lock when jumping in the air, sorry no 360° noscopes. Footsteps are a very good indication of where enemies may reside, so you have to be very silent when moving. Some things that this game does not do well: Hit registration, it is actually horrible, and this subtracts from the immersion of the game when you clearly hit someone, and they don't go down - it can also be very fustrating. Ping really effects your gameplay in this game, as I said before hit registration is even worse when you have a ping of over 100!  Another fantastic part of this game is the steam workshop! Find weapon skins, custom UI, custom sound packs, well pretty much custom everything! This game is really easy to run, on almost any system you will run the game at highest settings at atleast 45 fps on almost every map.  Overall I really enjoy playing this game, and the team still bring out updates but they are not as frequent as they shoudl be!  8/10 ",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"The most exciting, immersive, fun, and lethal multiplayer FPS I have ever played.   The Battlefield...",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"Many of the games at a 60$ price aren't worth that amount. This game is definitely worth MORE than 15. It doesn't matter if it's on sale, you should get this game and tell your friends to get it. Here is why:  I have accumulated over 1,200 hours on this game and have actually founded a competitive insurgency team. It's only fair that I give the game the review it deserves. If you want to know about a lot about the game before you buy it, you're reading the right review.  The Competitive Scene:  The competitive scene, while not as big as CSGO, has been mostly developed by the players-many of which have played the game for a long time. These leagues (DGL, ESL, ANZ) spread across every region of the world and have offered regional seasons, tournaments, draft tournaments and even world cups. No matter what region you are from, you can play this game. I've played with guys from South America, America and Canada, Eastern and Western Europe (from the UK to Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand, etc. The game does not boast ten's of thousands of players but the players that play this game in the competitive scene are very dedicated. It is not as hard to learn how to play as it used to be because the game has been allowed to develop and the players have figured out how to play the different maps in general. If you're wondering what 'game type' the competitive scene revolves around, it's a game mode with 3 points that you can capture, objectives similar to that of the battlefield genre or starwars battlefront. You own one, they start owning one, and then there is a neutral point. If you cap a point, you bring your whole team back. You start with 5 players and they start with 5 players, you fight to the death to kill the other team, using all sorts of strategies and tactics, but also try to potentially cap a point (or bait a cap) and bring the rest of your team back. Sounds fun as hell, right? It's awesome.  Game Types:  If you're not a competitive guy, there are a ton of game modes to suite your fancy here. Want to play fast paced with 32 people and respawns? Choose Push. Want a slower paced mode much like the one I described for competitive, but with 16 players instead of 10? Choose firefight. Want a mix of Push and Firefight, with points you can capture but also respawn waves? Choose Skirmish. There are a few others as well- ambush for instance puts you on an attacking or defending side, where you are forced to escort your VIP (a player who cannot die) to one of two possible objectives. These are the 4 most common game modes, in that order.   Server Activity:  Insurgency recently broke the record of an all time high in the number of players online at once. No matter what time you get on to play, there are always active servers to play on.    Gameplay:  The gameplay is quite different from any other game. It's a lot like the Call of Duty 4 Pro Mod or hardcore mode. You don't have any HUD's or ammunition/health bars. You have your gun in front of you, the time of the round, the points and their status at the bottom of your screen and that's pretty much it. It's a source engine game, a lot of former COD 4 guys and CSGO players like it, although it's not really anything like CSGO.  Pace/Mentality/continued comparison:  It can be pretty fast paced- especially push. There are people everywhere and they're all trying to kill you. Other modes like firefight and ambush can be much slower paced. Yeah, you can go for that initial kill, and if you're good you might get it. The other team might also be playing slowly, and you might pay dearly for a risky move. I'd say it's relatively realistic enough to make it different from COD or Battlefield but still arcady enough to be fun for the guys who like that aspect of games- it's a good balance. Reloading takes a little longer than your average FPS, but not too long. Sound is really huge in this game- you can hear tons of things and when you run around people can hear YOU in the next room. You don't know how many bullets are left in your mag unless you've given it at least a little attention, etc. The game requires a lot of mental attention if you want to do really well, but also is arcady enough to where it's completely in your right to mindlessly shoot virtual people at 3 AM. For instance, you can't really mindlessly play Arma or Squad, but COD or Battlefield doesn't require quite as much mental attention. It's hard to be really good at CSGO- but for different reasons. CSGO is a lot about aim. I'd say it's relatively 'harder' to be good at insurgency than it is to be 'good' at Call of Duty or Battlefield, although prior shooter experience certainly helps. The mental aspect of insurgency and attention to detail isn't really found in another shooter. You'll definitely get a new experience here.  What are you waiting for! Go play the game!",1,1
222880,Insurgency," Insurgency:   An indie team of gamers turned modders turned developers.  Everything about this game was done right.  From the attention/engagement with the community to the sales that basically give this game away for free, which in turns invites more gamers, modders, and FREE content for the game from both the community and developers.  I got the game for free from a friend and what attracted me the most was the modding support and the open modding community. This allowed me to jump right into modding my own server out immediately. Under 2 years later, I host the most popular coop servers in the game with a continuously growing  700+ member community.       Bottom Line ",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"  The most exciting, immersive, fun, and lethal multiplayer FPS I have ever played.  The Battlefield...  If I had one word to describe the experience, it's TACTICAL. First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead.  MAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.  WEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does.   GAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell 'Alloha Snackbar' as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone.  Final Words...  One of my favourite games on PC. Kudo's to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys. They obviously have a passion for what they do, and it's part of what makes this game great.  It also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer FPS (TPS*) addiction, Socom 1 &amp; 2 ( 'Socom: Source' ).",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"Do you want to get shot? 'Cos that's how you get shot!  This game has been described as a cross between Counterstrike and Red Orchestra 2, and I think that fits.  The arcadey pew-pew of CS is absent and instead you play in a more realistic environment where your cautiousness and tactical thinking is rewarded. The sense of immersion is greater than in CS, and while the pace is (generally) slower, as a result it's also more intense with the stakes seeming higher.  You WILL get one-shot-killed in this game. AND you will one-shot kill others. You know going in that this is the case: that bullets are very deadly. This affects the way you play and you value your life more, and this in turn increases the immersion.  You will NOT find yourself (as seems to happen in CS:GO) plugging several rounds into an enemy standing right in front of you who immediately one-shot-insta-kills you, and be left with the feeling that your death was somehow unfair.  The bots in co-op mode; waves of enemies that unlock after an objective has been achieved to protect the next objective or re-capture the one just taken (randomly triggered) behave, on the most part, very realistically. You'll get ones that see your head as you lie prone and headshot you and you'll get ones that rush past you, failing to spot you waiting round a corner (as well as ones who anticipate you hiding there). They never feel either under or over-powered and do a good job of convincing you they're real. The only exception is their tendency to disregard fire (from molotovs/incendiary grenades) and they will quite often simply stand in the flames and burn to death without fleeing or run straight into the fire, disregarding it and ... die. That needs fixing.  Co-op with 5 other players feels very good. Six player teams mean you don't feel too much individual responsibility most of the time, but that can suddenly change when at the last moment as your comrades have fallen you're thrust into the role of saving the team, capturing the objective and triggering their re-spawn against the odds. This can result in an Immense sense of achievement and reward when successful and (unless you're playing with Grade-A A-Holes) good-natured sympathy and/or hilarity when you fail. Communication with your team is often essential to succeed, the whole game mode is very enjoyable.  PvP is a blast and where the comparison to Red Orchestra 2 is closest. Squads of up to 16 players (although, as this is a Source-based game 12v12 is the norm) fight against each other across some beautiful and realistic maps.  You will love the warm glow of the sun in the late afternoon as you run through the crunchy snow, but you will also curse that very same sun getting in your eyes and obscuring your view of the other side of the ravine and that blasted snow for giving away your movement.  The feelings of 'oh crap, oh well, here goes' as your squadron marches into uncertain death that games like Red Orchestra and Planetside provoke is here, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale, but Insurgency does it better. It's prettier, smoother and more polished than RO2 and your value to your team is much higher than in both that and Planetside.  And did I mention how inexpensive it is? The Fun:Value ratio on this game is very, very high. If you have a few spare quid and a few friends to play this with, you will have a blast with Insurgency.",1,1

222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is a hard game and raw, you probably will be able to fully appreciate only after few rounds ended disastrously and any hole in his chest too. The title offers good realism of firearms, a personalization system treated classes, a decent graphics and sound rendition definitely noticeable. Co-operation with their team is a key part of this title and play to help his team rather than get a good personal result is required. If you're the kind of player who prefers a quick and immediate and perhaps loves being the Lone Wolf of the situation, then Insurgency is not for you, but if you're the kind of person who likes to cooperate with fellow to develop complex tactics and a type of gameplay less frenetic and more reasoned, you have found a game worthy of your attention.Insurgency is a multiplayer shooter that delivers everything it promises and it does it with the weapons of the maximum realism, without compromises or concessions modern. Take it or leave it, but if you like the thrill of dying with only two bullets take it ... also costs little.",1,1
222880,Insurgency," Note   Please remember that this review represents the personal view of the author, and is in no way an absolute truth, so there's no real point in arguing in comments about anything if you disagree. Still, if you really want to, no one would stop you from doing it. The author disclaims any liablity or responsibilty for any consequences of proper or improper use of this review.  ***  Because of my strong love for f-word, I'll replace it with the word 'chainsaw'.  Credits of this idea go to Jon Lajoie (cheers).  *** Operation Flashpoint, Rainbow Six (the old stuff, like Raven Shield), SWAT - that is the kind of names that comes up in my mind when I hear the combination of words like 'fps', 'tactics', 'realism', 'hardcore' and so on. Unfortunately, related words usually were 'dead genre', 'empty multiplayer', 'what the chainsaw they've done to the series, why couldn't they chainsawing do it just like the old times, chainsawing chainsaws'. But things have changed for me in March 2014, when I purchased Insurgency. To tell the truth, my hopes weren't really up about this one (even though I played Insurgency when it was a mod back in 2008 and I really enjoyed it), for I've seen too many new fresh games that looked promising and got positive reviews to turn out to be, em, disappointing, including the sequels of series that kicked ♥♥♥ back at the time. So I was pretty scepctical when I started playing, my judgement wasn't clouded by so called 'wow-effect', the one you get when you start a game you've been waiting for and looking forward to, but in the meantime I wasn't too sceptical, and I actually even forgot that I played the mod.  So here I am, playing Insurgency, trying to figure out who is who, what to do and where the chainsaw I'm being shot at from, and the more I play, the harder it gets to ignore this thought screaming through my brain: 'THIS IS CHAINSAWING IT MAN THEY FINALLY CHAINSAWING DID IT'. And it actually _is_ it. The game is challenging: you  don't have crosshair, healthbar and even ammo count on your HUD, only the amount of magazines, o you have to elaborate some sort of 'feeling' of how much ammo you have left in your magazinge and how bad you are hurt; you can actually die from a single bullet, and that makes you act carefully and steady; it's hard to aim because of the 'trembling hands' effect after you sprint for some time and the suppression effect that is caused by being shot at (really cool feature that is also implemented in a nice way); equipment weight and resupply points that make you choose the equipment wisely - you can't assemble a 'wunderwaffe' and have it all; and many other things that make this game hard, complex and challenging, but so damn enjoyable. It really feels great when you accomplish anything in this game, even a single kill, and the key to success is your tactic thinking and experience, and only after that come reaction time and velocity.  The game has multiple game modes, and each of them plays a little different; that adds to gameplay variety pretty much. There are even coop modes against bots, and that also creates more ways to play the game (for example, you can play it alone, which I prefer sometimes).  The game's techincal side is also in a good state, I've had no technical difficulties since the very start.  To sum it up, Insurgency is challenging, old-school, hardcore, interesting, intense, rewarding and just fun. P.S. The two things that make me love this game even more: 1. The updates, that often include new content, features etc are free. That is just amazing, two thumbs up for the developers, or whoever is resposible for this. 2. Once you start the game, the first thing you see after it loads up is the main menu. Yes, you heard me right, this game has NO CHAINSAWING INTROS at all. At first I thought it was temporary, but it's been like this for more than a year now. This is my personal favourite, and it may be even greater than the updates thing for me.",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"Insurgency is one hell of a beast, created by mixing up all the good things from other great FPS title. It has the realism of Red Orchestra / Rising Storm that adds a great immersion and intense atmosphere, the small skimrish maps akin to Counter Strike for a quick and fun close quarter battles, great weapon customization system that reminds me to Rainbow Six / Ghost Recon, and Battlefield's class based gameplay.   Looks unoriginal eh? Nah, not at all. Insurgency DO feels like a combination, something 'in between' of those game, but the devs executed the ideas impressively that I can consider Insurgency as an original, somewhat one of a kind game that still maintain its own unique identity among an ocean of FPSes nowadays.  Gameplay (10/10) Immersive, intense, hardcore, yet it still can offer a fun and enjoyable experience. Insurgency is one of those 'easy to learn hard to master' game. Naturally, Insurgency itself is a very simple game, the thing that you'll have to learn is how the general system works, weapons and attachments, the different set of classes, and the realism factor itself. I believe you'll fully understand how the game works in around an hour, or even less. Insurgency isn't for a trigger-happy FPS player. Patience, teamwork, and careful observation of your surrounding is the key here. Even if you already do that, like walking slowly, crouch, peeking on corners, you'll find yourself in 'WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE BULLET COME FROM?' situation, first shot, screen blurred, second shot, you started to panic, third shot and you're dead. In many occassion you don't even have the time to be panicked, you'll have an instant death.   Another great aspect of this game is how devs design the overall system. No grinding, no perk, just pure skill and tactic. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of varied game modes that actually..well..varied, a balanced class system. Overall Insurgency is, one of the most balanced and fair FPS I've ever played.  Sound (10/10) I could've put it in the gameplay section, since the sound isn't just to make the game more atmospheric, but the sound design is a part of the gameplay, its a crucial part. For a modern military FPS with a flare of relism, the sound must be designed to make the game, not only immersive and realitic, but also 'usable' and its actually a part of the tactic. Yes, the sound is mind-blowingly fantastic. I love how detailed the sounds are, the sound of bullets blazing over your head, hitting the wall or floor, fly near your ears, and when it do hit you, everything become muffed. The guns sounds realistic, it doesn't sound too weak, yet doesn't sound THAT powerful. Sound is your best friend and your greatest enemy.  Graphic (9/10) Insurgency is built from Source Engine, which is, in a way..dated. But. thanks for the great level design and visual effect, and of course the gameplay. You'll find Insurgency's graphic to be a brilliant one. You might think Battlefield has the most realistic graphic for a FPS game. That might be true, but Battlefield's graphic is just too beautiful to be realistc, I find it more in the cinematic side. Insurgency, in the other side can capture the overall atmosphere of a battlefield. A battlefield is supposed to be 'ugly', no filtering, no lens flare, it's rough. No, no.. I don't say Insurgency graphic is ugly, far from it. It's a bit dated yes, but the 'dated' factor and the genius devs behind the game make Insurgency's graphic looks truly believable.   Conclusion (10/10) Immersive, believeable, realistic, hardcore, tactical, yet still fun, enjoyable, and pretty much accesible. Insurgency is a perfect balance of realistc / hardcore FPS game with the close quarter combat fun and quick matches of a more arcade-ish FPS game. Insurgency does take inspiration from a wide range of FPS game type, but the devs cleverly managed to distinguish the game to something more unique that can stand at its own two feet and overall maintaining its own identity of a new kind of FPS game.",1,0

As a Serbian generally I dislike kebab, but I found myself muttering 'allahu akbar' uncontrollably as I got kills.

222880,Insurgency,"This game is worth more than it's retail price, yet I got it for free because one of the developers sent me a key. Now, 180+ hours later, I'm still addicted to it. I bought the Humble Jumble Bundle just so I can pay back the developers in some way, and gave away the key I got. The devs are awesome--they are a part of the community. The community is awesome, too. One of the most mature communities you'd find in FPS games these days. You will truly enjoy playing and will always have a sense of fullfiment when you win because communication and coordination with teammates are required to win. This game is worth more than it's asking price. I completely stopped playing CS: GO after I got this. Hopefully more people discover the beauty of this game.  TL, DR: Awesome devs. Awesome community. Awesome game.",1,1
222880,Insurgency,"This game is not for the impatient or the twitch shooters who like mindlessly running and gunning down whatever moves near their randomized spawn. Skill is not the be all, end all of this game. It plays a large role but ultimately boils down to: The smarter team ALWAYS wins.   If you like first person shooters that are challenging, i recommend this game. It will make you an extremely efficient player in other fps shooters if you invest some time into it. With 1 or 2 bullets killing you, it forces you to really learn the maps for camping spots and how to properly use cover/concealment. Also, players learn your strategy from the previous rounds so you have to be adaptable and unpredictable. The developers put an emphasis on teamwork and it shows. The scoring system is based more on playing the objectives and less on the k:d. It is also extremely rewarding if you win after a long round with evenly matched teams.   The workshop is one of the reasons why I really enjoy this game. It is completely customizeable. You can change the weapons, optics, reticles, scope reflection colors, gun sounds, player skins, music, and even environmental details just by hitting a subscribe button (for free). The community is also amazing. You have a ton of players making quality mods including the developers themselves posting weapons. You know it will be top notch.   If pvp isn't your thing, there is a coop setting with many fun game modes where you play against bots. There are even many custom servers.  As for how the game runs, it is very smooth. Even if you have a lower end rig, there is very little compromise and still looks friggin awesome. There are, however, minor bugs here and there and sometimes crashes happen but it is still a solid game.   One thing I noticed is that the developers did their homework with the guns and are very detail oriented. You can see smoke trailing off the end of the barrel after shooting for extended periods. Blood splatter patterns of your teammates can indicate the direction of the shooter. Each mag contains the correct number of rounds after you reload (no fairies sitting in your pockets recombining your ammo in this game). The suppression is so intense that it scares the crap out of you the first time you pick this up. Changes in tone can tell you what type of grenade was thrown. And the audio direction cues are spot on. You can pinpoint exactly where someone is sneaking up on you, based on the footsteps or gun sounds. I've noticed a lot of fps shooters have sounds indicating the general direction of players and then you have to search a little to see the enemies. In this game, you hear them, you shoot them.  Cons:  1) Crashing to desktop can be a major buzzkill 2) Some custom servers override your mods and can cause conflict making parts of the gun invisible until restart 3) Spawn camping (until you learn to avoid certain areas altogether, it's not fun) 4) You will probably suck for a loong time in this game in the beginning 5) This game is hardcore so there is no crosshair (ever) or kill indicators on some of the servers. So if you're used to having them, you're gonna have a bad time... 6) Teamkillling and spam kickers can get out of hand very fast and ruin the experience sometimes. 7) Your character can be pretty stupid. When you are trying to be sneaky behind some enemies and a teammate happens to die within your line of sight, your guy might yell out, '♥♥♥♥ THEY TOOK OUT OUR SQUAD LEADER!!' getting you completely massacred. Can't tell you how many times I've died from the stupidity of my character announcing my presence.  Still a great game though and I highly recommend it if you have the grit to take it on. (I have some friends who refuse to play this game because it was too hard for them. Especially on the sniper heavy pvp maps)",1,1

The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3).

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.  Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?  This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter.   When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"The very first Fallout game I've played. I've been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes , thinking of something to write, but thanks to writer's block, I'm going to make this short and sweet:  - It'll run well on pretty much any computer that's not 10 years old - It's fun and funny - If you like shooters or RPGs, I'd recommend this - If you like Skyrim, I'd suggest this  If you do buy it, I just suggest one thing: Use the manual save, and only the manual save. If you're comfortable using the quicksave, go ahead- don't try and load off a quicksave though, only use it when in game. Don't use the autosave function, it's pretty unreliable.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"I think this review is going to be much like my Arkham City review; I would say the majority of user's on Steam will have already purchased Fallout: New Vegas, and most will have probably even finished it. So this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who don't have it, or just haven't played it.   Fallout New Vegas was released in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the areas of Nevada and California. You play as a Courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the New Vegas strip across the Mojava Desert. During the delivery, you are captured and shot dead (or so they think). After being recovered by a friendly robot, you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land.  This was my first ever experience with a Fallout game; I had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there, and of course I am on the internet, and so it's always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so I knew what I was getting into, a huge deep time sink.   Game play is focused around the use of your V.A.T.S for guns, as well melee weapons. V.A.T.S pauses the game so to speak, and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body. You have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode, so once you aim, you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set. You can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode.   As you wander around the desert, you will find plenty of items, weapons, food, drink, books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another. Obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find, alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time. This can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor. As you progress through the game and get a higher reputation, you unlock safe houses, where you can store your items in fridges, cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling.  One thing I was surprised about in Fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as I had initially imagined. I created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations, and this cut down the amount of fighting I had to do by quite a bit I think. It was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as I have not come across many that have; like wise, you can go guns blazing at all times if you want; although I would hate to see how your story ends out.   Within Fallout New Vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game, right until the last moments in the game. Along the way you will pick up side quests, these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed. There are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while. Some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable I have ever played, helping ghouls escape on their great journey, liberating a power plant were among my favorites, but there are just so many to do, and I would highly recommend that people don't just rush through the main quest in New Vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content.   While the graphics in New Vegas don't look like the graphics we have today in game; they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play. I played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through; I was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state, it looks nice. You can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find.   The game has varying levels of difficulty, you can play it on hardcore mode, or just on the regular easy, normal and hard modes. I played on normal mode so I could see the missions, story and explore the world without being too focused on min/maxing my character to be optimum at all times - although once I got the option to have Boone as my companion (a sniper), the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time, sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead.  As you can see from the amount of time I have put into New Vegas, this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see, and probably in our life times. You will never be bored; there is always something different to do, whether it be crafting potions, or just playing a little Black-Jack at the casinos - there is never a dull moment.   I 100% recommend Fallout New Vegas to anybody. Even if you aren't a fan of RPG games. New Vegas will probably change your mind; this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and I cannot believe I had not played it until now. If you haven't got New Vegas, get it, it's on sale quite regularly and if you do have New Vegas but haven't played it; please don't wait a second longer, boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game. Easily one of the games of our generation.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.  Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.  New to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.  Whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.  So it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough.   What is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.  Fallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey ♥♥♥.  Fallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time.   I played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.  The Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit.   The combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, I use a mod to keep that part off.  This is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.  Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it.     Buy At Full Price    ",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a 'Fallout' game.   If you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games.   As someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.   Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?",1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Gameplay is amazing. Writing is incredible. Immersion is insane. The amount of choices YOU can make for yourself is unmatched (looking at you, Elder Scrolls). Kept alive and fresh by an *excellent* modding community. Get it. Also, the DLC storylines intertwine. They don't interact much, but it's all cohesive.  Get it.  Cons?  Bugs.  Unfinished content, woes of a rushed game. For example, Caesar's Legion (one of the three main factions) lacks as much ingame depth as the NCR (much ingame depth). Another example being Freeside's (outskirts of New Vegas) condition - cut content, seperated zones (there is a mod series called Freeside Open dedicated to restoring this).",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"-=-Hello! If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Fallout New Vegas Review.-=-  If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, you might be familiar of the famous RPG/Adventure game developers, Bethesda. They do an AMAZING job at creating medieval and sci-fi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago. I think Fallout New Vegas is a great game, but the graphics and presentation are ugly. Its really not even an upgrade over Fallout 3, I would call it more of a downgrade. Bugs are small in amount, landscapes are varied, the open world populated, and many, many towns and cities to visit, including your very own Vegas.   Okay, off of the specs: You start out in a small town with a gun, and you can get meat cleavers, baseball bats, plasma rifles, sniper rifles, a concrete club, etc. There are lots of choices on weapons. You have so many choices of armor, too. You will never get bored of character customization. Some horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat. The worst I've experienced was walking through a rundown factory, killing weird creatures and invisible giants. GORE. Yes, I said gore with all caps. You can dismember people! Even when they're laying on the ground, dead, you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads, yes heads, off of the corpses. Crippling aspects. Pretty neat, although weird in some ways. I shot a centaur with an incinerator (Flamethrower) and I crippled his tongue. Mutant creatures. Giant flies, scourpions, and geckos, etc, alongside and against eachother. (I was walking to a town called Prim, and a fly got mauled by a young gecko.) The exploration in this game is incredible. You can go through Vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire, repaying debts, etc. You can head to several different other towns, drink out of toilets to regain health, take down large bandit empires, and kill large geckos with pool cues. If you like the Elder Scrolls, this game is fun and enjoyable. 9/10 great game, accidentally deleted my level 12 character and I hate myself for that. (Spent 9/10 hours working on him. I had a sword and medium armor. freaked me out, I guess I can restart.) Anyways, thanks for reading my review, please rate if it helped, also comment on what you'd like to see in any other review, open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed. :)",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"  Developers from Fallout 2 involved in the creation? Yes.   Elements of the cancelled Van Buren (Black Isle's Fallout 3) finally brought to life? Yes.   A mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences? Yes, yes, yes.   For all intents and purposes, Fallout: New Vegas is the true Fallout 3 and the best sequel to Fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series.  Unfortunately Obsidian was stuck working with Bethesda's sub-par game engine and base mechanics, but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up Fallout 2. If you're a long time fan of the Fallout series, playing this will mostly make you forget about Bethesda's attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over (problematic automatic weapons, for a big example.)  Also worth noting is that Obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project. The fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me.  Lead developer JE Sawyer's mod (though I consider it a much-needed patch) is highly recommended for the best possible experience.

All of the DLC, and mini quests even were all very enjoyable, such a wide variety of ♥♥♥♥ to collect and do that you can put a solid 100 hours into one character without the addition of mods. Fallout is such a good game, but they really took a ♥♥♥♥ on my chest when it comes to the ending. Now I know a lot of people say that 'Oh I prefer it this way', and then other people say 'It's better this way', but the ending to Fallout New Vegas sucked donkey ♥♥♥♥, mmk. I had so many plans, I was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending, but you know what they did instead of let me do that? They gave me the option to revert to a pre-hoover dam battle save, or return to the main menu never allowing me to continue that character from the end of the game on. Finding out that there was no free-roam really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, regardless the game is very fun, but hey at least it doesn't give you a worse ending than Skyrim's. I suggest doing everything you want to do with the game pre end game cause you wont get to do it again, enjoy the game, and don't try to 'experiment' with fisto.... please.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"I am the Courier.  After I accepted a package to deliver, I found myself on my knees outside a village looking at a shallow grave. A man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head, telling me I had entered a game I had to lose. Like so many others, my story would have ended in blood.  Except I didn't. My lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up. Sadly, my name and life was gone. All I knew was the face of the man, and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of Goodsprings. I don't know who I was, but I know who I am now. I am the woman who will have her revenge. As I stepped outside, I saw the good people of Goodsprings being ravaged by bandits. I took up my 9mm pistol, and told the leader to meet us. We would give him their prisoner. As they stepped out confidently, I shot them all in the head. The blood stained the sand red, but the bandits left Goodsprings alone. Taking some food and water, and as much ammo as I could carry, I took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep.  I eventually came to the town of Primm; here I met the NCR. A large group of foreigners who told me what I could and couldn't do. Wanted to help, but didn't do anything. Unbound by their rules, I picked a rifle out from their bed and, at night, rescued the locals. I supported the new Sheriff in Primm's independence. The NCR was only willing to watch; cowards, the lot of them.  I later came across more of them; content to sit, drink and complain, I learned of the situation of the Mojave desert and began to fix the problems; they thanked me, paid me, took the credit, and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere. They had built a great statue, but did no great deeds.  I then moved along the path, following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip, until I came across a town on fire. Outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps; I killed them all and took their caps for myself. Strange. Stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt; a town of the dead. Legionaires of Caesar came to me, and asked me to carry on their message. All shall be equal before Caesar. I remembered these words.  When I came to Novac, I found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the NCR. As I saved them, I taught them to stand alone. I met the NCR at the power station; obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert, I sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people. I winked at my fellow co-conspirators of the Fellowship of the Apocalypse, and continued on my way.  At a trading post in the middle of nowhere, I met Veronica. Beautiful, if eccentric, she was as alone as I was in this desert. She told me of the threats the Mojave faced; her own Brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the NCR. We travelled together, learning of the plights of the people in the Mojave.  As we moved along, we came across the poor gathered outside new Vegas. The Fellowship of the Apocalypse agreed with my thoughts, that those in power cared little for the Mojave beyond resources and manpower. We killed the local drug dealers, killed the troublemakers, wiped out the Kings for creating a civil war, and once peace reigned, continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion.  As I looked upon the wealth of New Vegas, I saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside. I found my man in his suit, 'Benny'. Surrounded by guards, he warned me off. I hadn't come this far to fail, however, and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room. Alone, I took my pleasure from him, and with his shaving knife, cut his throat in his sleep. That was the first night I slept well, although I needed a shower upon my awakening.  I discovered his secret; a robot that could change the whole game to my rules. Not a brutal conquerer like Caesar, not the haughty expansionists of the NCR, nor the greedy self-interest of House; no, Yes Man provided a new way. Our own way. My travels taught me that only in true Chaos could the strong rise and lead the Mojave for itself; not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich. That was what I told myself as I walked through the rivers of blood.  The White Hands family was first, high airs and low appetites, I smiled as I cut my way through them, executing them with the same gun Benny tried to execute me with. Then the Omertas, typical schemers; they screamed as I murdered them in their beds.  Instead, I put the power into the hands of the people; the Boomers, remants of those before, I brought their dreams to life. I gave the Brotherhood back to those who would see it's power restored, partly for my philosophy, partly because Veronica had been my partner through everything and I would see her dreams come true as well.  I then found the Sierra Madre, a dead land with untold riches. Finding it ruled by the mad, I killed the King of the Dead for my partner's sanity and the safety of the Mojave, and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison. Alone and silent.  I found Mt. Big, the hope for the future from the past. Dusty, unused relics, I crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot. Our future would be our own; the past had already failed us, as my past had failed me.  To the north, I found Zion; a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires, and despite the bleating of pacifists, I forged these people into a strong ally for the Mojave; they, like we, shall be independent.  Finally, I took control of New Vegas; as the NCR and the Legion of Caesar fought, we executed our coup. A grand army of independence, from the many I had helped, came to free our land from the bear and the eagle. We drove off the Legion; and when the NCR came for their blood prize, I had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death.  The Mojave is free, and shall stay free. Even after I leave.",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Hands down the best game I've ever played. I love it more than I love my family.    'Three crippled limbs, haven't slept in four days, no ammo left and hunted by the Legion. But atleast my spurs go Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.﻿'    It's a perfect RPG with a perfect amount of everything you want. Unlike Fallout 4, you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue, and the ability to make up your own story. I usually end up using revolvers and repeaters, since I'm pretty much obsessed with cowboys. The amount of really good side quests is incredible. Some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of Fallout 4. Although, in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in Fallout 4.   What about the DLC's? The DLC's, well, they are as amazing as you'd expect from Obsidian. Honest Hearts my favorite, since I love the landscape of Utah and    the story of the Burned Man.     Old World Blues however, made me laugh as much as I have never laughed at a game before. Lonesome Road and Dead Money? They are gold aswell (literally).   The soundtrack is the best. Ever. I've been listening to the music from day 1 since I got the game, and I know the lyrics to most, if not all the songs. It's quite surprising how you won't get tired of them. Also, Mr. New Vegas. It's impossible not to love him. &lt;3  How about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute? Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, any day, any time. The conflict between the NCR and Ceasar's Legion is far more interesting and immersive than the BoS vs Institute thing. I'm a bit of an NCR patriot myself, heheh.    Never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive.      'Crashes by the number, Glitches by the score, Everyday you love me less, Each day I love you more.'    Let's talk about mods. Oh, lovely mods. If you're getting a Fallout because of the mods, this is the one for you. You can (and should) customize your game entirely using them. I'm running 100+ mods now and it's not even that much. The problem is getting the game to work with all of them though, it can be pretty frustrating.  New Vegas is nostalgically depressing but it's surprisingly a great feeling.﻿  So, should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed Fallout game or spend 20 bucks on the best game ever made? The choice is up to you. I'd get this game though.   Edit #1 Please, vote for this game to win the 'Test of Time' award. Obsidian deserves it.",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Where do I even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game. Let's just start with some history: Fallout New Vegas is the Fallout 3 that should have been. At least, most of the elements that make their appearance in New Vegas were actually of the original Fallout 3, which was canceled when it was almost finished by Bethesda so they could make their own 3, which wasn't as amazing as it could be in several factors, and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors, to say the least. Fallout New Vegas is pretty much more of a Fallout 3 than the actual Bethesda Fallout 3 was, so calling it Fallout 3.5 isn't doing it any justice whatsoever. Plus, Fallout 3 runs quite badly on the PC partly due to GFWL and apparently is even more crash-happy, so there is that.  On to the actual game, it is incredebly enormous in size.  I bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least.  If you just take your time and explore like me, expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run. The game world feels huge, with way more than enough places to discover. Also, it has a gigantic list of quests, so yeah, this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks. Evenmoreso with the Ultimate Edition, which covers every piece of Expansion Pack/ DLC with it, which ups the game length very reasonably, and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile. Not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the Mojave Wasteland, but they all bring enough new in-stuff to the table which is also useable outside the Expansion Pack arenas.   Have I mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons? Seriously, I cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use. True, it is partially due to the Expansion Packs bringing a part of it to the table, but even without it is bigger than Fallout 3, and with the expansion packs, it absolutely makes Fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two. The only thing Fallout 3 has weaponwise what New Vegas doesn't is the Rock-It Launcher, but that is about the only thing.  Even if it isn't graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine, GameBryo, which really should be replaced next-gen and is still a bit glitchy, it is still really acceptable, and hey, graphics aren't the most important things in a game.  Story's pretty great too. It all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like Bugsy Siegel, if he wasn't shot in the face (yet) and wasn't living in a post-apocaliptic Nevada/ Las Vegas, you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit, where ever he might even be, to have a very stern talk with him. What's more, is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the Mojave and New Vegas, and it is all your choice who's gonna come out on top, by what means necessary... Or you just decide to take it all for yourself. Voice Acting is pretty well too mostly. Just don't expect the nameless NPC's to say something amazing.  Darn, hear me rambling about this game, and I've probably haven't even covered a small part of it! In short, this is a quality game, the Ultimate Edition is where you should go for, and it is really dirt cheap during event sales (like 5 bucks in the Summer Sale) , and you really should pick it up, for a game of this calibre it is practically theft.",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"One of the best games I've ever played.

If not, don't even think about it  - VATS doesn't differentiate friend from enemy so if you're using it quickly it IS possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether they've been killing each other at all  - There is a comedian next to one of the doors on the Strip. His line about not being able to get to sleep WILL help you pick up girls in real life  - 'Side' quests can be ridiculously long-winded, but worth it  - Everything you eat is irradiated, so I survived on hardcore drugs alone.

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"'Are you a maker of war, or peace?' 'Pizza.'  ***EDIT*** For those in need of a second opinion, I'll gladly share mine.  It's not often we can find masterpieces like Fallout: New Vegas, and when we do, we want to play every second of it, search every corner, search for every little moment it can provide us, and this gem... It does a great job at that. The dialogues and voice-acting are incredible and unique (See above). Every character you come across in the vast land of New Vegas is memorable. Every one of them has a story to tell, and it's your choice if you want to listen carefully or not.  Vanilla version has enough content to keep you interested for hours, the variety of weapons is huge. From Ballistic Fists to Anti-Material Rifle, you won't need to worry, this game has everything covered. If that wasn't enough, it's extremely moddable. Story is the strongest point. With multiple endings, endless replayability is guaranteed, and I'm not even mentioning the DLC's yet. I've finished four times already, and I will finish it again. Every playthrough was a different experience, and it was delightful.  It's definitely a must have, even for people who doesn't enjoy RPG's... Like me.",1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation. It takes the fundamentals of the classic Fallout games and puts them into the Fallout 3 engine, giving fans of the original games a true successor.   Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, New Vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original Fallout series, and whose strengths are writing and solid role-playing mechanics, and it shows. The writing throughout New Vegas is phenomenal, and no matter what type of character you want to play, the game was made with you in mind. You constantly feel rewarded for your choices. Hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game, having to get food, water, and sleep. For a real challenge, check out the mod Josh Sawyer (lead designer) made for the game. It takes hardcore mode to a whole new level.  I also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for New Vegas, since it has the best DLC suite I've ever experienced. Each of them is brilliantly crafted, expanding the story of New Vegas in interesting ways. Furthermore, the DLC is foreshadowed throughout the main game, and the DLC can cause changes in the main game as well. If you only get the DLC for one game, make it this one.  I can't recommend this game enough.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Now this..... this is a Fallout game. Don't get me wrong, I 'liked' Fallout 4....  But I LOVE New Vegas.  While actual gunplay and animation is mediocre, the characters, world and story is what keeps this game as one of the best of the last generation, and one of the best in the Fallout series. Bethesda should've taken notes from Obsidian, but the newest installment just doesn't live up to its name, compared to Fallout: New Vegas.  You're not a concerned parent You're not a middle aged white protagonist And you're not looking for an oversized maggot character model that we're supposed to call a child  YOU, good sir/madam, are a FORMER courier from Primm, a settlement in the Mojave Wasteland, left for dead by some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high roller wannabe. You wake up in a tumbleweed settlement named Goodsprings, and go out to claim your revenge, and shape yourself to be WHO YOU WANT TO BE and the world AS YOU SEE FIT. While you may be the best in some aspects, this game will assure you that you are NOT a god on earth, or a wasteland deity, but just a guy or girl that is just good at what he/she does in order to survive and leave an imprint on post-apocalyptic America.  There is no 4 choice dialogue crap, there is no binary form of morality in terms of how you play and impact the world, nor are there any quests that are just there for grinding.  Your story is A STORY, and it is up to you to make the best of your time in the Mojave Wasteland from the beginning, to the end.  Ladies and gentlemen, in the end, this game brings to you an excellent story, RPG mechanics, characters, a breathing world, plenty of diversity, and so much more that if you choose this over FO4, I can assure you that you are not missing on anything, but rather are making the smartest decision. This games needs you. And when you boot it up, it will not bound some of your choice with Bethesda's chains, but greet you with open arms, and welcome you into New Vegas in hopes that you will, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it you will, enjoy your stay.",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"I never really made a real review. It might be a long review. And yes there is gonna be a TL;DR.   AND NO, I DID NOT GET PAID TO MAKE THIS REVIEW, THIS IS MY PERSONAL REVIEW.     So lets start off with the history of the game.",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,I have paid for hundreds of games yet I have spent the most time playing this free to play game.,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"Alright, i'm gonna be a defense attorney for H&amp;G right now because it really doesn't deserve the mixed user reviews that it's got anymore.   This review turned out way longer than i planned so a tl;dr would i guess be that most negative reviews are either completely wrong or unfair for not showing the good sides of the game. My plea is that you ignore the negative comments (most which are outdated) and simply give the game a chance, try it out yourself, i mean it is free after all. If you like it, cool welcome aboard. If not then so be it, not the end of the world, is it?  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Now to the actual review.  I can tell that the developers have a lot of dedication to have gone through such a huge amount of backlash and negativity from their own community. Because they've been pumping out updates consistently since launch despite of that.  This game had many flaws last year and still has quite a few today, but the developers are actually listening to the constructive criticism and are improving upon it every update. Which goes to show that they actually listen to the community (at the least to a degree.)  While yes the veterans and long time players have an advantage over new players, it's NOT Pay2Win anything in the game you can buy with free in game currency, including veteranship (VIP kind of thing.)   Yes the game is fairly grindy, the graphics (as in lighting, shadows and texturepacks) aren't on par with tripple A games and some mechanics have to be worked on.  But the thing is Reto's still adding content along with changing/fixing (and sometimes sadly breaking) things every update.  The incredibly long list of negatives about this game last year has shortened by a huge amount, which just goes to show that they're actually listening and trying to make this a fun free game for everyone.  Despite the negative reviews the game is very addicting, can be a blast and has multiple customizable different classes including Infantry, Recon, Tanker and Pilot that along with 3 factions and a pretty large variety of guns and vehicles makes sure you can sink in lots of hours into the game. So do give it a shot if you're looking for a free WW2 shooter.   It feels like the mixed reviews and negativity are putting off a lot of potential players, which was one of the reasons i made this review in the first place.  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Here's some of the criticism that the game still gets  1: Hackers In all my time playing this i've never even once met a cheater so i really have no idea where the 'hackers everywhere' reviews are coming from. (my assumption is that they just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d by a skilled player and then cry about hacks)  2: Performance The ones complaining about load times and/or performance really need to get something that's not a toaster before crying. H&amp;G really isn't very resource demanding especially compared to games like battlefield and GTA. I run a constant 140 fps max settings with my gtx 1060 so there's your proof that it's your hardware not the game.  3: The Grind  This one's a valid argument about the grind which someone asked in the comments and since everyone obviously doesen't read comments i'm gonna put in my reply here.  The game does not require several hundred hours, to unlock 'anything but basic' equipment. (by the way even if it did, the starter weapon is amongst best weapons at close to medium range if modded correctly so you could totally keep going with the basic and thrive.)  While the grind was huge before it has been addressed and isn't as horrible anymore, for example 50 hours of playtime as an infantryman can unlock everything in that class. The game is obviously still grindy, but that comes with free games and i'd honestly take a little bit of grind any day over pay to win.  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Thanks for reading this unnecessarily long review. I guess i just couldn't stand by while people kept bashing the game, there was a time when it was broken and deserved it. But that time is no more and Heroes&amp;Generals does in my opinion very much deserve a second chance.  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"Im a realist plain and simple. You can do anything you want with this review, even wipe your ♥♥♥ with it for all I care.  The game is free to play (awesome) the graphics are pretty damn good for a F2P game.  The game introduces all types of troops to play (Infantry, Recon, Paratrooper, Tankman, Fighter Pilots) (Stated in the game description)  The game has three factions (US, Soviet Union, Germany) with varying guns, equipment, and vehicles for each side. Sides have their weaknesses and strengths in areas...it evens out for the most part though!  Equipment modifications (ammo type, trigger hairs, barrels, springs, sights) that can increase a weapons effectiveness such as accuracy, damage, and range.   Tankman details: There are 4 armor classes in this game; Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor, Tank Destroyers. Each group has seemingly cool tanks with varying side gunner seats with MG's or even secondary cannons.  The maps...the maps are incredibly huge (I mean it) that consist of buildings scattered along paths, with a big town in the center of the map (mostly).  The realistics of the game: Bullet drop/travel, Stamina bar, Grenades seem a bit more realistic to me (big radius), Weak and strong points of armor on the tanks, Fighter planes seem realistic (HE bomb dropping &amp; geometry), For the most part it can take 1-3 (maybe 4) rounds to drop a guy. There are RESOURCES, meaning that everyone has a limited supply of tanks, fighter planes, paraplanes, and infantry (lives really). The game can be won either by capturing key points or lines OR by destroying the enemy completely. It just depends on how long the game goes.   For some negative reviews that I see about 'campers'. Its a realistic game, this isn't really a game for 'COD Warriors'. Running in the same direction that you previously got sniped in is the definition of insanity...doing the same thing and expecting different results. It's a game that requires a little bit of tactics and/or even communicating with your team. Rambos don't get far.  For the reviews saying its a pay to win game. Everything is available to you by earning credits. Everything. You can even buy the 'Veteran Membership' with credits. People can buy stuff with real money, but they must unlock the items first (paying for each little ribbon completion is expensive as hell). This game is nowhere near pay to win.  For the reviews saying it takes forever to purchase things. It really doesn't take forever. You are paid on an hourly salary(not including getting paid for your score after the game). The more you level up your soldier, the higher his salary is which means more money rolling in quicker. If you are looking to make credits extremely quick. Buy a fighter pilot, learn to fly and shoot well. You will be leaving with a lot of credits as your score will always be in the thousands every game. 262 hours when I wrote this review. I have all US type soldiers. Infantry with ALL weaps. I have a paratrooper, Recon with fully upgraded sniper rifle (most expensive class AND weapon), Tankman with best Light Armor, and a Major level pilot.  That is my review. Do with it what you please. Beyond amazing game for a F2P.  P.S. If you plan on playing. Do your TEAM a favor and get on the objective points to capture or defend, every body counts. Dont slap on a red headband. Dont wander through the forest. :)  For the developers :)  Ideas: Fighter Planes with tailgunner seats. Combat medics. Building windows with MG mounts (maybe), Bipods, Compass HUD, Ability for Squad members to highlight areas on map for squad to see, and finally...*VOICE COMMUNICATION* with channels such as squad or team.  Things that may need fixin': Vehicles crashing into TRAIN TRACKS when trying to cross them, getting off motorcycle (at full speed) and dying.  Thank you for this wonderful game!    ",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"(This review needs an update, due to it being outdated)  This is a extraordinarily good World War 2 Multiplayer game. It has lots of potential, I could see this becoming very popular, if the developers (Reto-Moto) would remove at least some grinding.  You will have to pay, at least a little (or play quite a lot), to do away with the grinding - just going to be blunt. But seeing beyond this point reveals an extreme potential in the game, since almost any F2P game has grinding, I can forgive it for this one.  The developers are, besides that, extremely committed to Heroes &amp; Generals. Since the Steam release they are working a lot harder to make this game better, after all - the more money they get from the game, the more it will inspire the developers to create more &amp; better content.  They are holding Devstreams weekly, instead of monthly, they show off great features that are coming, or have arrived. Several great builds have already been created in the 9 months Steam release, and it DOES make a significant change for the better with each update.  There are 5 classes in general in it, that you can switch to, after gaining a certain amount of XP with your main. You can then swap to that new 'rank' (or buy one individually from the store): Infantry, Tanker, Airforce, Paratrooper, Recon - for a fee with money you earn in-game.  Each class adds a new playing style to the game, they are highly useful, especially if they are skilled players &amp; know how to play the game/class.  There is also a general class, which does not participate in battles, but uses 'tickets' to send divisions to areas on the campaign map, which will then create campaign battles which the 'normal' players have to fight, and this in turn will alter the course of the war.  There are great authentic weapons &amp; vehicles that further enhances the flavour, the sounds however, can still be improved upon - though they sound better now, they can still use an overhaul.  Some maps are quite huge, in comparison with other WW2 MPs, and some are small, but they are all decently crafted &amp; enjoyable.  Some character generation might not go astray,  but it's probably not necessary (for now at least).  I cannot wait to see what this game has in store for the future.  I urge you to see past the grindiness that this (&amp; every F2P MMO) has, and you will learn that you like it, at least, give it that try - it deserves it!  Personal score: 7.5/10  Best regards, Dukhat",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"*Be warned, this is a lengthy review. If you wish to sit and read it all then I suggest you grab yourself a snack.  This game is a ton of fun. I have had more crazy moments in this game than any other PC game. In no other game do I get the same feeling then when I entice a tanker out of his tank only to kill him, steal the tank, and go on a rampage to turn the tide of the battle. I have had many moments like that in this game. However, this game is not perfect and has some noticeable flaws.   Let's start with the positives.   -As I mentioned earlier this game can really make you feel as though you are the hero of the battle. While this feeling is not necessarily consistent throughout the game, when it hits there just isn't anything quite like it.   -There is a decent amount of content in the game. There are about eight guns available for the infantryman in each faction and different guns for each faction. Add onto that more gun mods than I care to count; with multiple choices in ammunition, trigger, various internals, sights, and different skins. In addition to all that you can chose to load up with various mines, grenades, knives, and even binoculars. And that is just the infantry. You can also play as a tanker, a fighter pilot, a paratrooper, or as a dedicated sniper. Each having additional, more specialized equipment.   -Flowing from the previous point this game has some pretty diverse gameplay. One minute you are holding off an enemy tank assault. The next you are pushing forward to cap one of their command posts. The next you are using Anti Air guns to shoot down the fighters harassing your allied tanks. All of this from the point of a lowly infantryman, not even beginning to scratch the surface of what you can do in the game.   -The graphics, while not very impressive on the technical side, are aesthetically pleasing. The art itself is clean and very consistent. Nothing in the game looks out of place. There are a few issues with z fighting in a few maps, but they are only noticeable in extreme top-down aerial views and not noticeable during gameplay.   -The developers of the game are very active with the community. They listen to complaints and suggestions. In addition they post a fair amount of news to their site and host dev streams to show off the features they plan on adding to the game.  Unfortunately that brings us to the negatives.   -This game is not very friendly to new players. With a mildly confusing UI, no immediately apparent tutorials (one does exist, but you have to search for it), and the possibility of entering a match with highly experienced players leads to a frustrating experience for people just starting the game.   -Once again building off the previous point, the game's grind can be very long. There are ways you can shorten it significantly without paying a dime, but they require a fair amount of research and in the end only shorten, not eliminate, the sizable grind. **(Note: recent updates have shortened the grind. I have not had the opportunity to really test ho much it was reduced.)**   -Additionally, this game has a few very interesting bugs. It certainly isn't the buggiest game I have ever played, but be prepared for the occasional oddity.   -Again building off the previous point, the game suffers from some performance issues. Unfortunately, I run the game on a laptop so low framerates are to be expected, but many members of the community report less than ideal frame rates on their systems. **(Note: while not perfect this issue has been greatly reduced. I am able to play at a reasonable level with the same hardware)**   -Finally, while there are, what I find to be, a decent amount of maps in the game, many building and environment assets are copy pasted throughout them. The maps themselves are fairly different, they just look similar.  All of that said, I find that the positives far outweigh the negatives. This game is very enjoyable, especially given the fact that it is free.",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"For New players  If You are looking to get into this game you need to be aware of few things  1 yes, it have pay to get stuff real life money shop, but you can get all of it with in-game money. Yeah, it will take time and so on, but after you get what u want it feels great, as well better stuff won't make you play better(i bought scope with gold and found out that i suck with it, while with iron sight i'm pretty good.) so only thing what recomend is veteran, it will give you some exp boost(it is if you like game)  2 You will die a lot, at least in begining, till you learn how to play, well i still die a lot, but i make some enemy players die a lot too :D what i meant is, head shoots, grenades, road kill - in time it may feel unfair, but you will learn how to stay alive long enough to take out 2 enemy tanks with panzer-snacker, kill rogue sniper and steal their stuff :D  3 i have heard that game have cheaters and ect. But as far i can tell, it have some skilled players too, and by investing time in it, not cash you can be one of them :)  4 grind, yeah, you can say it's grind fest, but which mmo isn't? And i will put it simple, if you like game, that grind won't matter for you, cose as you play you unlock stuff and as like i said, better stuff won't make you better(i'm rank 5 infantry, loving my starter G43, taking out higher rank players with their ‘’uber’’ guns, just need to play smart)  5 HaG, is not your standard FPS, you run straight to enemy- you die, you try to be next ‘’rembo’’ - you die, try to take out tank with standard grenades - die, so what you do is flank, take cover, prone, run in z style, use mother earth as your ally, report snipers to your team-mates, play as team, use suppres fire, smoke them out with grenades etc  6 you start out with 1 loadout, after a while you can customise to your playstyle, found what works for you  7 game isn't for all, especially not for 10-14 years old cry babies or short temper ppl and impatient persons. You need to take time with this one, take it slowly, set your goals and work hard to get them.   My first impression.  When i picked it up i didn't like it, i meant i died instantly in all possible ways, headshot, legshot, torso shot, roadkill, grenades…. And that money shop.. I with my friend was like, it's p2w, you can't do ♥♥♥♥ without paying rlm, enemy is op (playing as german and german only), and so on. But as we played we wanted to see how THE big war looks and we aimed to get on rank 5 and on the way till rank 5 some changes happen, not to game, to our playstyle … i stopped to run straight on enemy positions, stopped to stand up or still in 2v1 fights, stopped to aim for most kills, instead i start helping team in big picture. Capture objective points, kill rogue snipers, defend our points and so on… and the more i kept playing the more i enjoyed game, like now if i can get 1 good match out of 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones it's worth it and the atmosphere of game are perfect, airplanes roaming sky, tanks rolling over land and me as infantry in middle of it all :)  + one can customise his character to his play style (be brave, be sneaky, be tanker, be pilot and so on) + rewarding unlock system what responds to your playstyle + great game to play with your friends (make a squad and you can team crush your opponent)  + think your enemy have better guns? Kill him and pick it up to see for yourself + game strongly rewards team play and tends to punish rambo wannabe’s  + nicely done progression system which will make you busy + good use of repair system which won't allow to spam op equipment( could be more balanced though)  + for f2p game are well balanced, u can get all what you need with ingame money, what leads to point where your opponent can't have something what You can't have (well it will take time, but then again more you play this game, more better you will become)  - vet. Bonus is overpriced, i need to spend 15£ to get it, so yeah, devs should make it down on 5£, cose i personally don't like to use gold, it's make me feel cheap  - only 2 tier system, so after you get rank 5 game kicks you out in big pot with high skilled players what makes it feel unfair sometimes, they could add tier 3 and and let tier 2 be mid ground for lvl 5-6 or 5-7 players to get around of things or something like that.. - game isn't friendly for new players, i mean if they don't get how to play it in first 10h they will leave it cause if you try to play it as regular shooter you will lick bottom forever… - no training grounds for tankers, pilots and ect … i mean, i would love to see what is what before i spend shitloud of my hard earned in game cash to switch my infantrymen on different branches, so that should be fixed.. - upper point and some other design choices tend to lightly hint on more cash in, then delivering most to players enjoyment and it's sad.  For dev ….  I got it, that one needs earn money to keep supporting game and making it better, but if one truly says that they have players first before cash in you should fix some things, first make it separate vet. buying option, so one can spend ~5£ to get vet. Not 15£ to get vet and leftover gold.(one day saw over 10k players on steam, if half have a vet it's already reasonable cash on month) In my opinion it would be nice sub model for beta game and still would make money. As Well player should be able to see all clases himself in advanced training so they know what they are getting because now it's buying cat in bag…  P.S.   Great game, eager to see it expand and become better:) 8/10",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"Update since Adams Update: There are 2 ways to play, FPS or RTS: To the FPS side, there are 2 different types of battles, Staged and War  STAGED Staged battles make each side have the same resources on each side so theoretically, each side has a fair chance of winning. It can be different everytime but there will always be infantry :P. Sometimes there may be medium tanks with planes or there can be light tanks with paratroopers etc. You can play as any of the 3 factions any time you want but each soldier has it's own equipment and level so choose wisely.  WAR After a soldier reaches rank 12 or is a general, they can buy assault teams that affect the war and how it plays out. While you can do this, you are stuck with the faction you choose until the war is over and then you can swap. Playing war allows people to level up faster both by their actual level and their ribbons. In exchange for this bonus xp, the matches are much more... unpredictable. What resources you have will be dictated by the general's ATs that are fighting in that area. If you lose the battle, that area will be taken over by the other faction. If you win, you'll keep/takeover that area. Each battle is just part of a larger battlefield all across Europe with over 3000 different locations to fight for or to defend. The war ends when 15 major cities are taken over by a single faction.  HOW YOU WILL START Most people with start with the FPS side (unless you buy a level 12+ soldier or a general). You will start playing encounter first with other new people which is a small, infantry only map. It only has one objective so it can be a tad bit hectic but it's only to help you get used to the game and they normally last about 5-10 minutes. Once you reach level 1, then you can start playing the smaller attack/defend maps. You will start to see the other types of classes in play now (recons, paratroopers and tanks (becareful of these buggers :P)). Once you reach level 5, you will be allowed to play the larger A/D maps and you will be introduced to planes (also avoid these buggers xD). You will also beable to play war batlles but I wouldn't advice it until you get better gear.  GOODS: - Pay2NotGrind not Pay2Win (no one can really gain a definite advantage over you, skill will still reign supreme), I've seen people think they can win by paying money and see them do absolutely terrible with a MG42 xD I could kill them with a stock M1 Garand! - Variety of weapons used (STG, M1/M2, PTDR, AVS-36 etc.) - Different variety of maps (some are more CQC and others more open) - Infantry, Tanks, Planes, Paratroopers, Recons (oh my!) - Infantry Only Map! :D - EVERYTHING CAN BE BOUGHT WITH INGAME CREDITS! (this includes Veteran (premium) Membership!) - Anti tank weapons are found around the map so tanks can be destroyed even if you don't have AT nades or mines! - Higher rank of your soldier, the more money he earns - Modable weapons! - Since Adams update, they've added a way for infantry to deal with planes WITH MOBILITY! :D - The starter rifles have receieved a massive buff that puts them as one of the best weapons in the game currently if you use the right mods  BADS: - Not very welcoming for new players (stuck on SA for a while...) - Tanks and planes can be a problem if you don't have the right equipment - Currently, Germany is the most populated faction with most of the vets, America is mostly full of the newbs, Soviets is least populated but I find it's an average player base - YE GODZ THE GRIND IS GREAT - Got to pay (either with ingame credits or gold) for the weapons you used (mods, ammo, the weapon itself...) but if you're smart, this cost shouldn't be much - The maps can get a bit repetitive after a while but the devs have stated they have maps in development  Conclusion: - It can be overwhelming at first but stay for the long run to have the best fun - It's like a 'WW2 Battlefield' - It encourages playing the objective and not K/D like COD  - You earn more money and xp for capping/defending the objective than just killing the enemy team - Don't listen to the negative reviews by people with only 6 hours into this game, they just call BS reasons why you shouldn't play  - They mentions hackers but in all of my 600 + hours, I have yet to encounter a hacker - Be smart, don't be a jimmy (Kotton reference :P)  Now to ready up my M1903 and M1 Garand and kill lots of people :3  EDIT (G Build 17/9/16): Now we can have bathtubs that float in water and drive on land! (Amphibious vehicles have been added that work on land and water :3) And the maps were remade but lets be honest, you just want the cars that float :D  EDIT (H Build): The 2 most OP weapons in the game, MG42 and M1/M2, finally got nerfed. Although, the MG42 nerf was a tad bit too harsh.",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"this game gets way more ♥♥♥♥ than it deserves, the devs are really good with listening to the community, fixing bugs and adding content that we ask for.  in my perspective there are more positives than negatives with this game, most of the complains are about the graphics, the grind and the P2W.  the thing you have to remember when playing this game is that its free to play, you really can't expect AAA graphics. Now, the grind in the game is a pain, i understand as the grind in the game used to be much easier, but i do respect the devs choice, being that if you could unlock all the items in the game there would really be no need to play. When i play a game like this one if i unlokced everything quick, by the week i got everything i would get bored of the game, being that i am playing the matches for practically no gain.  i really don't know how people think this game is P2W, seriously, i would pay $20 for me halving the grind wall for 1 day, how is that P2W?. also, unlocking guns with gold is even worse as you have to pay for the guns before it, and to add to the you gotta pay for the ribbon xp to upgrade the gun to make it any good.

227940,Heroes & Generals,"I've been with the game's community since Fall of 2014, so I know stuff, m'kay? While I rarely play the steam version (personal preference for the most part, I do like my browser edition!), I've got several hundred hours in-game alone clocked under my belt, and what must be thousands on the forums. Heroes and Generals is a game that seems to get a lot of hate for reasons that I cannot seem to actually find, in my hours of play. Some common misconceptions: 'The Game is Pay 2 Win!!!' No, it's not. If you definition of Pay 2 Win is a game that essentially makes you pay to get the better content, or has a paywall of some sort, then H&amp;G should be fine for you. All content that affects gameplay is available for free users, and while the game has a bit of a grind, it's nothing impossible. One piece of advice though, plan ahead. Know what you want on what soldier, because trying everything out on your first guy will result in one soldier with a lot of stuff who can only use one set of stuff per match - make a new soldier for each playstyle you want to have access to in-game. 'Newbies are underpowered (or some variation)!' At first you have an unmodified Semi-auto rifle, and the boots on your feet. Your rifle can be one of the most potent weapons in the game, and with skill and the right upgrades, you can turn your lowly M1 Garand/SVT-40/Gewehr 43 into an efficent killing machine. The game has a steep skill curve. You'll be up against 4+ year vets; BUT, not at first. For several hours you'll be up against people who have roughly the same time as you. Just take heed, as soon as you buy a weapon that has the 'gold matchmaking group' tag or you enter the gold matchmaking group via the player ranking system, you WILL run into players who have been playing for months, years, possibly since the game started. And yes, at first you'll get roflstomped. And then you won't. You should learn. Watch people of a higher rank, see how they move, etc. Hell, even ask them questions if they're in the deploy queue, f.e.   The game is hard. No purpose sugarcoating it.  However, it's nowhere as terrible as some of these keyboard warriors with &lt;10 hours make it out to be. Frankly, a lot of them sound like entitled little rats, but whatever. If you like the game, play it. If you don't think it's the game for you, then take your business elsewhere. But give H&amp;G the chance it deserves. It's a damn good game, even if it has its quirks here and there. I strongly encourage anybody who has the time to check it out. It's the least you could do.",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"PHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW I have waited a long time to write this review. Heroes and Generals is the best made game I have ever played, but... the most poorley made game I have ever played. You start up the game, pick a faction: Russia (The one everybody loves), Germany, (The one everybody hates), and the Allies (The other one). When you first start playing, it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing, and you generally have a good time. Then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like, with smgs, semi auto rifles, bolt action rifles and good stuff like that. Also, you die super fast, and don't expect to have health regen. If you get hurt, the game will not help you out, so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently (or inconveniently) around the map. Same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or anti-tank weapons. But you will die (Trust me, you will) and you will spawn back in... AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP HAHAHAHAHA!   Yes, you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die. I suggest that you invest in your faction's truck early on. Speaking of vehicles, the gameplay with them is crazy, fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics. But they have one other type of vehicle... Tanks. Oh dear lord TANKS! Where do I even begin... Okay. I can do this. You will have PTSD after playing for the first time with tanks. They are OP as balls and make you die and respawn, but we already covered that. If you don't take the game seriousley, as I often just mess around, they can add some fun to the game, but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it. Oh, and planes are the same thing, except you can't destroy them NEARLEY as easily as you can with tanks. Then I bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game.  Now, I will tank I mean TALK about the largest issue with the game. The Grind. After the first set of vehicles and weapons, tier II weapons all cost way too much. You can't make the money that you need because of another system I will talk about later. Because of the low amount of maps to play on, there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons. You can't even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you don't have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it. I will give you an example. Say I am playing as the Allies. I want the Thompson SMG, a Ka Bar knife and some stick grenades. I have the M1 Garand, and I level up my infantry assault ribon to level 4 to get the Grease Gun SMG and some Pinaple Grenades. Now I buy a shovel, because I need to get to level 5 in close combat to unlock the knife. I use the SMG, but then i'm not using the grenades, so I can't level up in explosives. I switch to grenades, but then i'm not using my shovel so i'm not leveling up close combat. I use my shovel, but then i'm not using my SMG. I pick up the smg that the enemy I just killed dropped and use that. But then i'm not getting xp in my Grease Gun so i can upgrade it. So it goes in a terrible circle.  I do like one system in the game, beleive it or not: The weapon upgrade system. If you use a weapon of your faction a lot, you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it, like springs, sights, barrels and some cosmetic things like skins. I like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most. For instance, I like the M1 Garand. A lot. I first used it as a sniper weapon, changing the ammo, getting better gas sealing and even a scope. But then I changed it to a close-quarters weapon, taking off the scope, lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire. There is a downside to this system, however.  The game's repair system, Ho MAMA. Every bullet you fire, every vehicle you spawn, every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag. It costs money, lots of it. I kind of like the system, as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary, but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own. Also, you guessed it- upgrades cost money between matches, so the game also punishes you for using them, which is a little strange.  Here are my suggestions to make this game better.  1. Add more weapons, so skill trees don't only unlock you one or two weapons 2. Lower the prices on everything, the game grinds on for way to long 3. Add more maps, the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools, playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast. 4.Balance your damn tanks 5.Place spawn points much closer to the action.   Okay... My opinion of this game... I like this game and want it to be good, but it is constantley held back from all these problems. And I know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff, but that is NO excuse for what we have NOW. They should have waited much longer on releasing this game, as I am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks. But one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play, as of now. My final rating for Heroes and Generals is a 7/10.  I will continue to update this review as the game progresses. That will be added to the bottem of the review",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"Heroes and generals is a game with reviews that dont tell the actual story, while it take 10k to get a scope there are ZERO items or skins in the game you have to spend IRL money on, this game is not for FPS players, its for RPG players, its got wow speed progression and there is literally a score bar for everything. this game IS NOT PAY TO WIN! It is however an enjoyable experience that i dont have enough hours to truely give a good review, but i can say its a definite pickup, if not a keeper.",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"DON'T READ ALL THE BAD REVIEWS. JUST TRY IT OUT!  THE GAME JUST FULLY RELEASED. OF COURSE THERE MAY BE A LONGER WAIT TIME THAN USUAL. IT WAS PROMOTED ON STEAM YA KNOW!  There has been so much negativity towards this game and while some of the points are valid, it's still a very fun game to play. The longest queue time I have had is maybe 5 minutes and I have rarely ever waited that long. I usually get in a game within 30 seconds. The grinding really isnt bad. You don't want to just have all the guns unlocked for you from the start! You want to be able to work for one! As you play, you'll get better with the guns you use and when you finally do unlock the other guns, you'll have that sense of accomplishment! Sure it's not a perfect game, but what really is? Compare it to a big name game like Call of Duty. They aren't flawless and always need tweaks after release! Games can only improve with time. This game is FREE. How many games have you paid $40-$60 for that you stop playing after a month and were far from good? THIS IS FREE. It is FREE. It's going to have its flaws but if you look at the bigger picture, it is a very SOLID game. Sure it's not for everyone, but man, I'm having so much fun with it. Of course it's no AAA game but that isn't why you play it!  Please just give it a try and have your own opinion. I saw it when all the recent reviews were negative about a month ago and still tried it out. I love it. Not going to stop playing anytime soon.",1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,"Many people call H&amp;G a grindfest; and that's really hard to answer, H&amp;G has no end tier equipment, so it's a constant grind, you can recruit more and more soldiers to get your dream loadout, there's no end, there's no 'best weapon', there's no 'best career', there's no 'best tank', there's no 'best camouflage'. You choose what you'd like to own, you can't have it all, unless YOU deside to own another soldier, another weapon, another tank... although owning one is more than enough.  People also confuse H&amp;G to be P2W; Heroes and Generals is NOT P2W, it's Pay-25-Bucks-To-Skip-5-Hours-Of-Grind and there's not a single item exclusive to 'P2W' players (Unlike WoT and WT), which debunks the 'This is P2W/has Paywalls' arguement (unless you really think that paying 25 bucks to skip 5 hours is a serius advantage).  As for the gameplay, it's Fun &amp; Addicting. Which is exactly why paying in H&amp;G is more of a way to support Reto than skip a few hours of playing.  However, I do admit the optimazition on this game is ♥♥♥♥",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"--- ---  Few bullet-points why I recommend this game over many other online-multiplayer-games with the current offerings (alongside why I for one have nicknamed this game as my ideal 'Battlefield'-game with its current offerings alone; to some extends I personally consider many of the features here to be the modern minimum-standarts):  - Vehicles are player-character bound and are spawn with them, so there is no need to rush to airfield / 'pads' or other spawn-points as no one is able to hog the vehicles to themselves (aside maybe perhaps just simply wasting the resource-tickets).  Vehicles (yes, even planes) can be still stolen / hijacked however, so it's not recommended to leave them unguarded (especially the tanks...oh yes, the tank 'gifting' is rampant in this game).  - Server / datacenter-side hit-detection and all shots have physics, I.E. no hitscan-weapons - Replay-system (though only usable by the H&amp;G-Support-team at the moment) for cheater-tracking-evidences and other development feedbacks (E.G. finding 'hot/death-zones' of the maps) - Region-free so everyone can play with everyone in theory ('single-queue'-system, even if you can only queue with a single-character at the moment); the battle-server/center is decided by the majority of the players in the match. Worth noting that there is no traditional 'master-server' to choose the battles from, but every match is setup with the matchmaker, aside for War-matches from which you can manually queue for specific battles.  ((Yes, this necessarily isn't the most 'clan' / 'eSports'-friendly game in regards that setting up competitive battles against each other is for the most part pure luck.))   -Everything except the gold* itself (in form of warbonds) is available with in-game-credits / 'silver' *Worth noting though that first completed match pers day (GMT-0) also gives 4-gold-coins (at the moment). There also has been a lot voucher-codes given away by the developers, alongside some events to boost the gold-income temporarily (E.G. instead of 4 you got 10-gold-coins for example).    All in all, a quite hassle-free WW2-first-person-shooter-game with a extra strategy-part to setup semi-custom-battles in a 3-way-War on the map of Europe. At first new players might get overwhelmed especially with the loadout-customization possibilities (E.G. training a specialized anti-tank-infantry), but eventually once starting to reach the higher ranks with better salaries to purchase more new characters and equipments for them, things get a lot more smoother.   --- --- Oh, and of course, almost forgot about this: - Bicycles, bicycles everywhere!  ((Provided of course you know where to find them: Sometimes they're right next to a spawn-points, sometimes you walk about 10-20-seconds to them. Those who 'complain' about having to walk everywhere just either don't bother studying the maps, or are even outright ignoring bicycles to begin with; both things (sadly) are were evident in War-battles / Elite-mode...)) --- --- ---",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"So after playing this game for over 800 hours, I thought it would be thime to write a review so here it is.  Good Game.  Thanks for reading it :3",1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,"I see big majority of bad reviews are coming from players who played a game for 1-3 hrs. I have played this game for a long time (it did not use to be on Steam, I played it since it came out). The game started of pretty good, but when they added it to Steam they kinda messed some stuff up. But around 1-2 months ago the game started getting better. Don't listen to those people that say that you have to grind enternity to get some good stuff. I haven't payed for anything and I have everything you can imagine, from Recon with camo and one shot kill sniper to a US paratrooper with a M1 Carbine (also tanks, cars, smg recon...) and this is one of the best WW2 games I ever played. It might not be the best, but it sure does not deserve this much negativity towards it. And to all who say this is a Pay to Win. Nothing good comes for free, you can't expect to just get in the game and level up like in CoD. Either pay (like you did to buy your CoD, duh!) or work to get the thing you want.",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"It's tiny! At 1.6Gb it's a return to games of the late 90's and early Noughties such as Savage. It's not perfect and it's not a sim by any means but; it looks, sounds, and plays wonderfully for a game that demands so little of your system.  It does feel a little freemium, but like EA offering Battlefield unlock packs I think the pull to simply not indulge in premium packs for solely your own gain is enough to hold off. If I bought anything for this game it would be to reward the developers who I am so impressed with.  I look forward to exploring more of it though as I'm still somewhat a newb, and the free to play aspect of it means I should be able to do this so look forward to killing me lots on the battlefield :D",1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,"Great Game!  The large maps add tons of room for strategy and the gunplay is more than good enough to keep you interested. The game can be a bit of a grind without investing a bit of cash but honestly that makes it so much sweeter when you finally save up enough coins to buy the next gun or scope that you've been focussed on getting. The team play and skill reliant combat have created more 'Battlefeel' moments for me than nearly any other game (Other than Battlefield, go figure) and considering its free you might as well give it a try.  Highly reccomended, especially if you have a friend or two willing to jump in with you. 10/10 (IGN)",1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,"Do you like tanks? Do you like planes? Do you like ww2 games? Because this is one of the best free online games on steam, taking place in a ww2 setting, you can join the American side, the Russian side, or the German side. With your choice, you are subject to diverse weapons, vehicles, and character personalization of that country. There is an advancement system of Ranks which is achieved when you gain experience from battle. Fight in large maps to aid your country in the War, or fight in a skirmish map for practice and less experience gain. Heroes and Generals is unique with it's scenery, an the maps created are greatly designed for the action that ensues. I myself thoroughly enjoy this game and always come back to it, again and again playing it to enjoy the thrill of my team all charging in with vehicles and on foot. Heroes and Generals deffinitley deserves a better rating.",1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,"This game is really cool, but it is really difficult to jump in and learn how to play well. It has a steep learning curve.  Update 9/26/16 I've been playing the official release now and I have to say that the game has vastly improved. It's a grinding game for sure, but to me it's equal parts frustrating as well as refreshing. I personally hate playing games where I can level up and get better equipment faster than I can learn how to play and strategize properly. So with H&amp;G I really enjoy that aspect.  I wish, however, that wait times weren't so long! And that you were thrown into games about to start instead of battles currently in progress. I want to be able to start a game from its beginning to its end, not come in randomly to a random game. The wait times to get into battles, though, is really long. You wait five minutes or so and get to play a short battle which isn't really that fun. Though, I will add that it depends what battle type you choose - some of them are designed to be shorter than others.  The game can be a little bit buggy, and getting around corners can sometimes cause lag or loss of vision, but otherwise this is such a great game. I love it now and I loved it when I first downloaded it. As a WWII history enthusiast, I find this game very addictive. If you like history and FPS, this game is an excellent combination of both!",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"I have been playing this game for about half a year perhaps a bit more, and i have to say i absolutely love it. You could argue that it has alot of grinding to get anywhere, its unbalanced because the enemy gets more tanks or weapons than you, but it wouldn't be as much fun if it didn't have these sort of things happen. You may think im crazy saying this, but think of it this way... You buy this game for 40$ play it for a few hours, unlock every gun and class, and then you stop playing it because there is nothing new to unlock, its just gets boring and old. Would you rather it get boring in a few hours? or would you rather have the thrill of dashing past panthers in a jeep planting british stickys on a panther, dashing for the point, and holding it down until the last moment to get tons of exp?  Theres also tons of classes to choose from, Tankers, Planes, Recon, Infantry.... And even infantry can unlock different vheicles... halftracks, (in the new update upcoming) WW2 style trucks that can hold lots of infantry, jeeps, all terrain snow vheicles... If you get bored of sniping, you can just switch to infantry again and have some fun with the ole ptrd, or perhaps become a tanker and blow the snot out of infantry with HE shells.... until of course they slap some stickies on you :P  I think this is a great game, but don't expect it to be a quick shoot for 1 hour and leave.",1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,"First a word of warning;  This game is not for people who run around expecting to rack up a massive killstreak and never die. the character models have physics on their movement. tnaks are ungodly strong until you have AT or a Panzerfaust on hand.

War is hell. you've been warned.  from the first battle, it's a lot of fun playing a WW2 soldier. the gameplay mechanics are pretty quick to pick up but theres a lot to master. the team play is super important especially in the early parts of the game. the gameplay is bascially pushing objectives and holding positions, almost like a moving king of the kill style play with a spawn ticket system similar to battlefield with more depth. the player credit/gold/warfunds system and ownership of gear gives you something to work towards and gives the game a very WoW/MMO feel. everything basically wears down and you need to pay either in-game currency or gold to keep these items in good repair. for vehicles this can get expensive quickly, but only for the higher tier ones generally.

227940,Heroes & Generals,"AMAZING GAME!  I love fps games, i play bf on console and counter strike on pc so thought i would get this game since its free.  Jumping into the game i found it very well balanced, i was with low levels from the start and was top fragging on most game modes, so i think the other revies which state you get spawned killed must be older reviews, as the games i have just played we have all had the same weapon from the get go.  coming from cs i can honestly say this community is fantastic i posted a quick hi new to the game on the forum asking for guides to help me get started and everyone was very helpfull.  I love the way the progression works, and it is something i am used to playing other fps games.   now my only quibble with this game is the upgrades which cost irl money, i liked this game so much after only playing a few hours i had a look at the upgrades to support the devs, bearing in mind i have never ever payed any money at all for a f2p game! However i was dissapointed by the upgrade cost, i do think the cost of gold and the 30 day membership is quit steep imo, bearing in mind this is totally optional, its a shame as i would have bought say a 1 time pass but paying monthly or every 3 months is just not for me and working out at about 6 pounds a month is expensive imo, if there was an option for a permant upgrade i would glady pay around 20 gbp and be happy about that, sadly i wont be upgrading due to the cost.   game wise the game is brilliant, i have sen a few other reviews with peopel complaining about getting insta killed etc, however i can only presume these people are not used to fps games (headshots) or are running on potatoe pc so they are at a disadvantage.  all in all i would give this game 8/10  the whistling and sounds are amazing and for a f2p game i would much rather play this than a bf game which is saying a lot considering how mmuch time i have played bf for!  great game give it a download if your a fps lover you will love this game! dont worry about the start menu it looks slightly complicated but you will understand it very quickly as long as your not a total idiot :p",1,0

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.  Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a 'Grandmaster' in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.  Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.  On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.  We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.  I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).  Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.",1,1

Community: Say to Russian 'Suka', and he will reply to you with ':(' #sadboys, people are friendly, talkative and pretty competitive, if you ask a person to use specific Warframe/Weapon - he will agree instead of fighting you that he wants to pick something useless.  4. GREATEST developement, I haven't seen so much care for a simple game like never... DEVs are always checking for Bug Reports - and always fixing them. They make live streams and discussing their next moves, make events with 'Platina' igname currency and working hard with community.  5. So far, this is the best Free-to-Play 'not Pay to Play' game. You are not forced to buy anything, like ANYTHING. You can trade with players for 'Platina', you can craft any in-game weapon without donating, you can purchase any skin without donating, the only purpose of buying platina is 'RUSHING stuff' if ure lazy to wait crafting process 12-72h, or buy Slots (&lt;&lt;&lt; Which yet u can once again trade with ppl for Platina and use it in Slots)  So the game is about FARMING and using your time. If you can't afford it and calling this game expensive then you are simply stupid. (I have donated 25$ amount in whole playtime, but not cause i missed something - because i wanted to support this amazing game)   Thanks for reading and I hope this 5 points review will punch your ♥♥♥ to start this great game.    P.S: If you need help with missions or you're loooking for clan - feel free to add me in steam or in-game aliases  Cptn.nVbs ",1,1
230410,Warframe,"There are very few games that have held my attention for 1,000+ hours over the years, this is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012), back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of content, new warframes, weapons galore, new planets, mission types, Archwing (fly in space!), events, clan dojos and foundry, player to player trading system, syndicates to join, player HUBs (relay stations), PVP, 8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters, 4 player coop, pvp, raiding, RPG's and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out.   The game is a constant work in progress and the developer Digital Extremes (DE) is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time. Warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframes/weapons combinations to see which one(s) fit your style the best. Believe me the game encourages you to do so, it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframes, weapons, Sentinels (companion), Kubrows (dog companion), Liset (your ship), with a multitude of color choices, skins and attachments.  Every Warframe has its own set of individual abilities, they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tanky, dps, sneaking (cloaking), solo play, healers, AOE damage, defense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example 'Continuity' mod allows for longer power duration time, when you ability is activated. More ammo, damage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primary, secondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods, especially made for them.  That being said the game can be very grindy, especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and 'fix' it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO' ish kind of games. (Constant 'balance' tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game either, the game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game market, it is  NOT  necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Except, of course vanity items, skins, unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game.   DE sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox (valentine's day, halloween, St. Patrick's day etc.) Free weapons too, they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at times, but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game.   All in all the future looks bright for this game. A Developer that actually listens to community feedback. Constant updates/hotfixes. Plus there is so much new content coming soon! Game is not perfect of course, but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game, definitely sets itself apart from the competition.  MMO's are hard to review, but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5",1,1

230410,Warframe,"Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe.   Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture.  Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free.  Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please. The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol, a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in.  And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee. We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine.  Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3.   So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative.   That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.",1,0

230410,Warframe,"Warframe in it's simplest parts is a amalgamation of Mass Effect 3 shooting, old school Diablo looting / hoarding, Free Running / Parkour, and freaking space ninjas! Did I say Space Ninjas? It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target. If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game.   It has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere. The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form. Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle.   Alternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe. You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows! You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission. Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel. If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space!   You have multiple saved loadout slots for free! Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games. They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight. Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them. They give away the best guns for free during those events.   They have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes. Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons! This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it. Isn't playing the game the purpose of it? Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free. Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it. At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century. And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort.  In short play this now!",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Space... Ninjas.  I shouldn't have to say anything more.  Fair warning: If you're not willing to spend a LONG time playing this game, you'll find your options kind of limited. You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option.  The mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at.  Good mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked.  I'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content. It can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe (class) you wanted a week ago and still haven't reached.  Playing with friends is recommended.",1,1
230410,Warframe,It's like a real life girlfriend. Only far less expensive and easier to grind.,1,0
230410,Warframe,"There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It's free.  Oh, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I'll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn't this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It's your choice.   So, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as 'Tenno' who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don't worry about that.   You will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don't have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it's good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are.   Oh and there are parkour. Learn how to press 'WASD' + 'LShift' + 'LCtrl' + 'Space' in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.  Simple?  Unlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won't be a simple 'run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep' type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.  Another merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won't happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.  Still, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won't say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren't much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I'm not saying there aren't, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.  Also, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn't much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive.   So, in general, try Warframe. It's free. If you don't like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?",1,0

230410,Warframe,"My god. I have not had this much fun since I discovered tf2.  Warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam. There's a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff, which imo is what makes this game so good. I was always a sucker for third-person shooters, and this might as well be my favorite. The gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off, but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from.  Something I really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play. You can be be at the sidelines of the battle, assisting your team and picking off targets. You can mess with your opponent, lining them up for a perfect slash dash. You can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective. Or you can ♥♥♥♥ all the ninja ♥♥♥♥ and come from the front, guns blazing. Also melee play is an actual, and reliable choice.  The controls are laughably easy to get into, after an hour I was completely used to it. And, now with the new update 14, there is an new and better intro to the game. It might take a while to discover what this does, how that works, what happens when I do this, .etc, but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki.  I would give it a 8/10, has yet to disappoint me.",1,1

This game has  Great Graphics , but with single graphics you can't make a good game.     but it can for some people     Edit2:  Actually, graphics are quite gorgeous for  F2P  game  So this game have a great choice of  Weapons , but 50% of them feels the same but most of them actually useful with high-level enemies.  Edit:  They adding a more and more fun and actually useful weapons now  Edit 2:  Nevermind, like 90% of  Weapons  are viable on all levels  And this game have a lot of  Enemies , but all of them feels the same and doing the same tactics, nearly only things that change with them are weapon, models and protection types (flesh, cloned flesh, robotic or ferrite armor, etc.), all enemies dies the same in your daily slaughter.   Edit:  But, they adding new Mini-boss type enemies, such as: Grineer Manics, Corpus Bursa and Infested Juggernaut   Edit2:  Welcome new Modular Corpus Enemies, such as  Scrumbus  and  Comba   Diversity of  Tilesets , and they all beatiful and atmospheric, but it doesn't really profitable to play on 60% of tilesets. because some of them (Dark Sectors have bigger Resource Chance and more XP and Orokin Void which have Prime Parts and more XP for example) are more profitable.   Archwing , it's nice to fly in open space and shot\melee every enemy who flies near you, but right now it's just barebones, nothing more interesting in it than few Extermination, Sabotages and Interception Missions and all of the Archwing and their specific weapons are hard to get.   Edit:  they added Archwing Mobile Defense and Defense gamemodes and first Archwing Boss - Jordan Golem, pretty cool actually   Kubrow , you can got and rise your own dog-like loyal companion, but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30% per day (they losts it like 20% per their dead), and their health drops about 10% per day, you need to buy refills (DNA Stabilizers, 6 things per 75,000 credits) which refill only 40% per use. and to find a egg you need to spend about 2-200 runs (depends of random and your luck) to get one. so in point of view they are just credit-sink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge (and sentinels don't require credits to take care of them and don't lose loyalty after death)   Edit:  A new breed of doge that pick-ups items for you   Edit2:  New 'Incubator Upgrade Segment' makes owning Kubrows much easier, Kubrow will lose only 5% per day and it automatically places Kubrow into stasis if he on verge of death  This game have great variety of  Warframes  and their awesome abilities, and most of them have many differences in abilities and different stats (and cool looks)   Edit2:  Every frame is unique and you can't really compare them, except if you want something specific  This game have a nice amount of  Bosses  (one boss per planet), but most of them are bulletspongy and boring, for example you need to wait until they become vulnerable or you need to shot into specific hit-point to kill them (example: Councilor Vay Hek, General Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, or Mutalist Alad V) and some of them closed behind keys to get frame which drops from them ( Vay Hek(Hydroid)  (No longer needs a key), Lephantis(Nekros), Mutalist Alad V(Mesa))    Edit2:  You obtain some frames from fun  Quests  Others through  Dojo Lab Research  And there are some with specific ways to earn their parts (Ivara drops only through  Spy  mission-type and etc.)  In this game  you can get every weapon\frame without paying  platinum (in-game currency you need to buy with real-life money (but still you can get it through in-game trade with people)), but you need to craft them yourself (blueprint costs credits (in-game currency you get through doing missions) some blueprints requires research from Clan  Dojo 's laboratories, which requires credits and resources too, and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft them (Resources you can get through missions from killing enemies).  Cool variety of  Mods  for Warframes and Weapons, which drops from enemies and you can make you weapon\frame more powerfull with them, but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies, and some mods are very, very close to be useless (Intruder: +6 seconds for hacking Maxed, Rifle Aptitude: +15% status chance Maxed.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  But even so this game is very good, and i had a good fun with it, i'm recommending it, try to play it with friends and kill things together. (I don't have much friends though)  Developers support this game with  Weekly Updates  and Hotfixes in which they fixing bugs, glitches and adding some new changes or items   Edit2:  Also  Devstreams  nearly every 2-3 Weeks with News about New Updates and answering questions from players  9.5/10, this game still grows and becomes more interesting with time, i hope on this game's release developers will get rid of all disadvantages in it.

(Reminds me of MAss Effect 3......on Steroids) Then I youtubed a few things and the game just opened up for me. This is how games should look and play, also being free is a bonus:-)",1,1

230410,Warframe,"Warframe's relaxed take on third person combat, impressive visuals, and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors. Latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair. All of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone.   You assume the role of one of the Tenno; an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing war.Your character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil. Caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate, they soon attract attention. Awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias “Lotus” the Tenno's intentions continue to remain unknown.  Warframe's third person combat is simple but refined, providing a very relaxed and smooth shoot-'em-up feel, while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay. Enemies will drop many modifications during missions, which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation. This design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the game’s RPG elements. Each of the weapons have their own specific function, attack patterns and style, which further compliment your playstyle. Dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instant-kill. Included to increase difficulty; it often feels unjustified and overly punishing.  Mission maps are generated randomly based on pre-existing tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen. Each mission has a specific objective, however many of these feel overly similar; often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests. Missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them; however this soon branches off into many directions, though many of these use the same tile-sets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two. Missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet, giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path.  The matchmaking system can be frustrating, offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress. Offering no options besides public or private, you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times. The matchmaking system definitely needs work and it’s constantly overlooked throughout updates.  Warframe's free to play model uses micro-transactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum. Free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons. Platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials. With free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content, Warframe shows how the free to play model doesn’t have to alienate non-paying users.   While Warframe doesn't provide the adrenaline fueled action we're accustomed to in shooters, its Shoot-'em-up style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition. The heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times, especially when farming for a specific item. Bugs can be prominent at times, especially the ones that affect the user interface, however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team.  Pros:  + Stunning visuals, especially for more powerful video cards + Plenty of weapons and characters to level up + Customization allows any type of design and play-style which adds replay value + Frequent content updates   Cons:  - Dying can feel unfair at times, leaving the player stun-locked until death - Matchmaking system needs work, often selecting poor hosts - High repetition within missions - High system requirements - Microtransactions are a little overpriced   While rough around the edges at times, most bugs and technical issues are not persistent. As long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isn't a limitation, there’s no reason not to give Warframe a try with its fair free to play model.

230410,Warframe,"You're looking at a player who has logged in a beefy amount of hours. After playing some hours, I am sure that you will be hoofed on into this game as well. So let me write this review to mootivate you to start playing.   Pros   + Beautiful graphics + Active gameplay + Endless content + A broad range of customization  + Over  100   200  300 ways to kill something + F2P + Amazing questines (gets better as new ones are added) +Space cats +Space dogs    Cons   - A lot of farming and repetition like any mmo - Very limited for a low rank/starting player, but its pretty easy to rank up the first few -Somewhat forced to buy platinum at some point, but platium is tradable among players -RNG -RNG -RNG -Lovely RNG -No space cows  The only major downside to this game is the farming and repetition unless you don't mind doing so. Overall, this is a great game to satisfy your inner space ninja needs.  . .  Tips  &gt;Buying Platinum is quite expensive, but 20% 50% and 75% discounts can be offered by daily login reward. Or you can just buy Prime access which includes a shiny prime warframe and discounted platinum that will last you quite awhile. &gt;I recall the game will award you ~50 non-tradable platinum upon reaching some mastery rank. I would  highly recommened  buying weapon and warframe slots with that.  I'm going to continue updating 'Pros' and 'Cons' as the game continues to grow.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a great game, with a few issues surrounding it.  The pros, in my opinion are: You never feel pressured to buy platinum, since trading is easy and so is getting credits. Each Frame (Character) that I've owned have all felt unique and pleasurable to play. The game looks gorgeous, hands down. It's use of lighting and such make it look fantastic. The missions, while repetitive at times, are enjoyable. Especially if you have a friend with you. There is a great variety of Frames, Weapons and Mods to challenge yourself to learn. Co-op is easy, and lag-free as far as what I've experienced.  The cons are: The game can bug out at times. Missions can be slightly repetitive, as said before.  Some players may just stand around doing nothing, or be bad at the game.  In summary, pick this game up if you have a few friends with it, and become a ninja today.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"This game is historically correct. Ninjas started as farmers, but soon became ninjas to fight off the samurai.  So... Ninjas farm. And Warframe is about ninjas.  You can figure out the rest. ",1,1
230410,Warframe,"It takes a casual to play one hundred hours, a dedicated fan to play for five hundred and an absoulute madman to play above 1,000 hours. As you can see, I have completely lost any sanity or will to quit. This game is slow to start, but with friends, cocaine and a spare 14.8 billion years, you too can become just like me and any other insane person that has put in more than 1,000. But to reach the golden 2,000+ hours, that is godhood.  Seriously though, its a good game with some rather baffling choices from the devs, but hey, if you can put that aside and don't mind grinding for a few hours this is the game for you. However you can and will get lost in the early stages at some point. Bring an experienced friend or even guides to help you if things get rough. But don't blindly follow guides. My best experiences in this game were finding them and messing around with builds makes this game so worth it. (At least to me) One more thing to those wondering, should this ever reach the top of the boards, yes there are microtransactions and yes there is paid currency, but you can work for every thing in this game, EVERYTHING. Course the grind is more challenging and the road of the grind will be longer than the lifespan of the universe but you can still work for it. There is a more sinister outlook towards the future of this game. So please, before it heads down video game dev hell, play it. It's free and it pretty fun.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Watched this game grow from the ground up.  Intense grind. Fun gameplay. Well optimized. Great graphics. Not new player friendly, despite their best efforts. Decent trade. Soloable but heavily reliant on the trade system. Diverse gameplay. Ever-improving late-game and story. quarterly events offering exclusive weapons and mod sets. Friendly community but mostly unorganized game play. Power creep is real in this one. Ever expanding gameplay and mission types. VERY In-depth modding system for all weapons, frames and companions ( and Yes, companions are legit in WF) Good dev team with weekly streams on upcoming ocntent and fixes.   The Mastery system/Profile rank is like most, a staus symbol and gate. By leveling weapons, waframes and companions you gain XP towards your profile ranks. Granting additional daily trades and unlocking quests, weapons and frames when reaching certain milestones.   It's also the biggest cause of Burnout in the game.The vast majoirty of the best weapons in the game are unlocked VERY early on, while most of the weapon gated by later mastery ranks are flat out terrible. However, ranking these is required to increase you profile rank. It's at this point that the game becomes very stagnant for most as the progression is no longer 'fun' and feels more like 'work'. I'ts created a community within the community that solely relies on loot caves and leeching XP from other players to bypass the leveing (playing) process.   Aside form that. TOP F2P I've ever played. (hours played)  If you don't live for the grind, this one probably isn't for you.  as a whole, 8/10",1,1
230410,Warframe,"An excellent example of f2p game done right.  Pros: - nice graphics - dynamic and engaging gameplay - unique visual style and story - good co-op PVE experience - non-intrusive and balanced monetization - excellent devs communication and feedback - game is constantly developing and new features become available regularly  Cons: - the gameplay becomes grindy over time - PVP is almost non-existent  So I higly recommend this game if you are into co-op PVE third-person shooters. It's a kind of game when if you get tired of it - you can always take a break, return at some later point and see a lot of new and interesting stuff added with the latest updates.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"BIG EDITS: This is long, and it is only getting longer with the edits I've been making. I repeat myself constantly because many only read the things they don't like and then comment about things I have addressed. This review is for new and old players. I say I can't recommend it, but there are many positives about the game. If you are dedicated to trying it out, you will need to invest a good amount of time to get to a competitive point. This is not a game you can just pick up. It is hard for beginners.   Let me preface this by saying I love this game, and I will always hope it gets back to being all about the players. In its current state, I cannot recommend it.  I've played this game since Beta release. I am a Grand Master founder, and have put a ton of time into it. Many of my friends and clan mates are still active, and I usually play with them for social reasons at night.  DE has beat this game into the ground. It used to be great. It was always grindy, but it was a delight to play through all the content. Throughout Warframe's lifespan, DE has had a ton of over the top dreams and incredible ideas. When Archwing was announced, everyone was super excited......then it was released. It was half-♥♥♥♥♥ and has not been fixed since.   Nerfs. Any veteran player (and even some newer players) could talk about nerfs all day. DE Scott loves his nerfs. He has lost sight of what used to make this game unbelievably fun.   DE Steve and DE Scott don't take the devstreams seriously, and constantly shoot down fixes and brilliant ideas from players.  I honestly don't think most of these guys play their own game. If Scott actually took a character off godmode for one damned minute and tried some endgame with his nerfs, the game would immediately get fixed. What these guys need to do is set aside one solid week a month and just play their game. They don't get a whole lot done, anyway. This would at least give them some insight into what needs to be fixed. DE has some serious ADD issues when it comes to fixes. They bounce around so much that nothing actually gets done.   GRIND/FARM: These guys talk constantly about reducing grind, but then the next update comes out and there are grind walls and wait/pay gates EVERYWHERE. I understand completely that this is a free to play game. There are right ways a wrong ways to go about it, though, and they've chosen the absolute worst way to do it. EDIT: The grind has been seriously reduced. Not only that, but it's a lot less monotonous and miserable to do so. The recent big changes in the void system have only really made it necessary to grind for Relics (void keys). Not only that, but the void is now a 'planet', and the traces are run on regular missions. Now you can do what my friends and I call 'killing four birds with one stone'. Grind farming is still a thing, but being able to farm four things at once is a HUGE step forward.  GRINDWALL/PAYGATES: By grindwall/paygate I'm talking about complete stoppage of progress due to a wait gate, which can be paid to reduce. This is what the foundry is. 12 hours for weapons, 12 hours for some materials for weapons, 12 hours for pieces of warframes, 72 hours for frames . . . . That means it's at the VERY least 84 hours to finish a warframe in the foundry without buying it. Some weapons need anywhere from five to ten pieces that take 12 hours to build. They are farmable in a way, but its random. Nitain Extract is needed for just about everything nowadays, and waiting for random alerts is ridiculous. It is NOT purchasable either. I get on the game after the family goes to sleep and I'll maybe get one a night. When some pieces need ten to build, and one frame in particular takes something like 15-20. This is bad game design.   It kills me to say that I would not recommend it. I love this game, but I hate where it is, and where it is going.  EDIT: If you can stand endless farming and grinding, then I would say go for it. Still not changing this from not recommended, though, as grinding and farming are two huge turnoffs to many players. I can only handle it because I used to spend a LOT more time doing so, and this is nothing like it used to be.  The art is spectacular. The graphics are amazing. The combat could use a bit of work, but it is fluid and is remarkably fun......for a little while. The grind walls for gear are downright criminal, though. If you plan of having fun, just get the frames you want and don't even worry about mastery rank. This type of grinding kills the fun of the game.  EDIT: See earlier. Void relics have seriously reduced the grindwall for gear. Highly suggest farming for relics with friends, so drop chances are that much better.  I'm sorry DE. I've continued to defend you guys for years. I've spent a lot of time and money on your game, but you're bleeding it dry. You're bleeding your players dry. You are killing the game that was once so beloved by your playerbase. Until you guys start caring about your game again, you will continue to lose the people that so strongly supported you for so long. EDIT: Many of the recent changes show that DE may have the players in mind in some aspects. I continue to play because of the amount of time invested into the game, and due to the fact that my friends still play. I will keep an eye out for player focused changes and let you guys know as soon as I know.  EDIT: Do not misunderstand me when I say I cannot recommend it. I am heavily invested into this game, and I can't bring myself to completely give it up. I still enjoy playing with friends. Many of them are still active players, and I mainly play to be social. The game is very fluid, but it gets old quick. If you're in the market for a FTP game, then give it a shot, but the grindwalls will eat at you constantly. They have done a few things to combat this, and they need to make their money somehow, but for every grindwall they reduce, they add two more.  If you have friends that play, go for it. If you are going to be playing with randoms, I wouldn't suggest it. The community is fairly toxic.",-1,1

230410,Warframe,"Nominated as the “Test of Time” Award  You can always come back to this game, they keep adding new content and extending the storyline.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"  The best F2P game I've ever come across. A fair bit buggy, but that's to be expected. The amount of content/updates that are constantly added to the game are insane. To give an example: If you were to compare what Warframe is now to what it was back in 2013, you'd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense. There's so much to cover that I cannot fit it all into one review, but let's start with the fundamentals. The only other shooter I've played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what Warframe allows would be Resident Evil 6. This game's combat system is that deep. I'm not talking about things like Mods or attribute values, I'm talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have.  In default mode, the shooting mechanics are pretty straight-forward. But the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode, the game reveals its mechanical complexity. With melee now your primary means of attack, you're able to empower attacks, block/parry, do combos through the use of Stance mods. The game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of Devil May Cry than an traditional shooter. Delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash. And with most Stance mods having at least 5 combo chains, (in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated Stance mods) the skill ceiling is significantly increased.  Beyond that are your movement options. You can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid-air. You can run on and scale/hang from walls, dodge in any direction, and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump.  The basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of Mods. Mods are items that fit into weapons and Warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player's chosen combat style. Every item has 10 Mod slots and 1 Stance or Aura slot. Each Mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item. Mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects. Weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect. It it through this system that allows Warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player's preferred approach to combat.  Customization is a large part of Warframe, whether aesthetic or stat-wise. You're even able to choose your own ship (though such a choice is purely for show), customize the interior of it along with your frames, weapons etc. Better yet, most Warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding.  This, however, brings us to some of the cons that Warframe can rely on a bit too much at times. The game is very grind-heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue-print, To its benefit, there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them. Furthermore, the game is exceptionally optimized; and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45-50 on a mid-range computer (I had an GTX 660 as reference).  Another problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy. One of the worst I've heard of so far is the inital Archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in Directx 11 mode. There are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game.  Certain cosmetic items (and even Warframes) are sometimes only purchasable with Platinum, which requires that players spend real money or trade/sell in-game items to other players for Platinum (if one does not wish to spend real money).  Story-wise, the game explains very little to the player up front and uses Codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala. Dark Souls. With multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the Tenno themselves, there is a lot of world building content for players to go through.  Overall though, it's an amazing and unique F2P game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon. If ever.  8.2 out of 10.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Note - if you dislike the review, please feel free to leave why.  Having put a good bit of time into it, I thought I'd finally 'review' warframe. I'm not gonna do a stupid 'I jumped off a wall at a million miles an hour 9/10' or 'Spun midair, became a rocket 11/10' bull ♥♥♥♥. Those aren't reviews, and they aren't useful.  So, who am I? I'm a Hunter grade founder, roughly 1k hours (says 1.8k, WF in game says about 1k, I blame leaving it up while I sleep for the alerts :P), and I started playing in U7 so I've pretty much seen it all.  WF went from a game where they had cool ideas about what they wanted to do, to a bunch of half baked, never quite finished or polished ideas that eventually just seem abandoned. I.E. the revamp of damage/armour and weapons, Archwing, or Void Tower missions. Void missions were meant to be hard, and for the elite, and have amazing loot according to DESteve before they were implemented, but in reality they are very easy, and just another place to run a million missions hoping for the 1% drop chance for the item you want.  As I see it now:  Pros: +Art team (sound, animation, graphics i.e.) is AMAZING (no sarcasm).  +Not P2W. Is it pay for convience, or pay to skip? Yes, to a fault imo, considering the prices are stupid. But everything can be earned in game, even if it takes a stupidly long time, and that time doesn't corrospond to how good whatever the item you wanted is.  +Stamina/movement has been reworked. No longer do you run like a ninja. Who has asthma. And both their left lung just collapsed. And their right lung. And just had both their legs broken in a tragic zorencoptering incident.  Cons:  -massive, MASSIVE grind and time walls (sometimes at the same time). Some grind is good, some waiting is ok. Done properly it enhances a game wonderfully, making that epic item so much sweeter and cool. WF however uses it in place of real content.  -P2P connection, no one likes lag, and WF rakes in cash. Servers should be a priority for WF.  -weapons are kinda meh. All the weapons of a given type feel the same (i.e. all bows feel the same, all snipers feel the same down to the RoF). By that, I mean they all just have slightly altered stats, none feel like they have recoil, or a worry about accuracy, or take more than point and click in the general direction. What I'm trying to say is that a lot of weapons (imo) just don't FEEL like they should compared to a lot of other shooters.  -Plat is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. I.e. weapon is around $10 roughly, and a new frame is roughly $20 iirc (assuming you don't want to do the farming for them). To make it worse, there's no rhyme or reason to their pricing. A garbage weapon might be more expensive than a better weapon for no reason, along with NO WAY to try before you buy ANYTHING. And contrary to what some people will say no, just because you like something does not automatically make it good, viable, or top tier.  -Enemies are stupid. The only difficulty there is for enemies is how many they throw at you, and how high their armor/HP/Shields and damage are. There's no attempt here, not even say, to make the trash mobs stand by the heavy enemies who either give buffs, have bigger guns, and use special abilities (i.e. projecting a shield).  -Farming is either survival, interception, or defense missions. Everything else is either a ghost node (level/area) generally.  -Balance... doesn't really exist outside of a general nebulous concept. This doesn't sound like a problem, but balance is the lifeblood of any game. I'm not talking about one or two slightly OP weapons, I'm talking EVERYTHING is whacked. Clan tech weapons (very expensive to craft weapons) are mostly worse than what you can find in the markets for way cheaper (roughly 1/3 fewer mats in some cases). Worse, there are mods that have been around for a year roughly, and are just as useless as the day they were created, for example, 'Warm Coat' is a mod that reduces shield reduction on missions that have the completely random ice effect, halving your shields. Besides the obvious flaw of not knowing when you'll enter an ice mission, you'll get better results from simply using a +shields mod of the same cost as Warm Coat.  -No endgame stuff. Sure there's raids, but that's just another place for them to add grind walls in place of real content. You'll do some massive farming, but at the end of the day, it was all for naught unless you wanna run hour long survivals, or high wave interception/defenses. Once you get a weapon decently modded, any skill requirement goess out the window.  -Content is sparse, and often trapped behind massive grind or time walls to stretch it out. Problem with that is that it's stretched nearly to the breaking point. Content comes down to grinding weapons/frames to level 30, forma'ing them (aka prestige) to make them slightly better, and repeat. Fusing mods to make them better and stronger, assuming you can FIND the ♥♥♥♥ing ones you want in the first place.  -New players have it extremely rough. They start off with garbage versions of mods, unknowingly, and the planets they unlock generally have the same mats, or atleast not enough different mats, which makes crafting anything very hard early on. Unless a new player has an older player helping them, they're SOL. And the one thing that was supposed to help new players, the codex, doesn't. You need to spend time unlocking it to learn enemy weaknesses, and what drops from them, making it even tougher for new players to learn about their enemies. Oh, and to scan the enemies? That costs credits for a consumable.  (INB4 'But there's a wiki!' the info should be in game, easily accesible.)  -Lore, what they have is great, and really sets up a unique universe, the problem is that they don't have almost ANY anywhere. Prime 'frames in their codex entry have a tidbit, normally just an short few paragraphs, as do some of the other codex entries, and TSD which adds a good bit about the tenno. This isn't so much of a con as they need more lore, which would be fantastic.  -Rushing Inherently nothing is wrong with rushing, but as a new player getting put with the more experienced players who just rush missions mean you're getting left behind, and missing vauable loot (for a new player) as the mission ends early because people got to the extraction zone and started a 60 second timer to end the mission.  -Communication This is their biggest fault, their streams are a mess. DEsteve or DEScott usually being the cause. I feel sorry for DERebecca trying to control their lazy attitude towards the stream, treating it as a place to drink beer instead of answering question the community asks, and avoids/dodges questions with half answers or jackassery to (rarely) straight up insulting people (mild insults at best however) and flatout telling them they're wrong despite everything saying they're not (i.e. armor in D1.0 scalled up to a 95% reduction pretty quickly, and every weapon that did not ignore armor was pretty useless, DESteve was against reworking this, even though all but 4-5 weapons were considered useless).  Also, going along with this, they're NOTORIOUSLY poor at including all changes in the patch notes.  -Bugs! I expect some, hell, EVERYONE does. But DE either seems to do ZERO testing, or so little that people are unable to log onto the servers at all more than once. As in a 100% fail rate for everyone, not just a server overload or something. So, either they're not doing enough in house testing, or they're letting things get changed at the last moment before a patch rolls out.  Conclusion:  I had high hopes for this game, and DE pretty much crushed them. If you like grinding korean MMO style, go for it. Otherwise stick with something better, like Evolve Stage 2 or, Overwatch. Or almost anything else.Overall, as the game is now, I cannot recommend it, as no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.",-1,1

230410,Warframe,"  Do you like ninjas?  Do you like SPACE?  Do you like slaughtering countless numbers of hopeless enemies and/or a challenge when it comes to high level ones?  Do you like being sneaky?  Are you okay with farming because of the satisfaction of getting that sweet, sweet final part of your weapon or new piece of armor?  Are you completely fine with having to wait for your items to craft for up to three days because of a schedule and you have other stuff you can do?  THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! I love Warframe so much. you don't necessarily need to buy ANYTHING with real money! it's only there for if you feel like it's worth your time, and if you don't want to bother, you can work for mods and sell them for the in game currency (Platinum)! there are a variety of different missions, each with their varying level of difficulty (some planets have higher level enemies than others), and not only that, the game is FREE! why not pick it up for the heck of it? who knows, you might get really into it, like I have! I've spent over 300 hours on this game and I do NOT regret it. all and all, my rating is, of course...  10/10! 100/100, FREAKIN' AWESOME GAME. seriously, I don't know what draws me in but I love it.",1,1

230410,Warframe,Warframe was there when my dog died. Warframe was there when my girlfriend left me. Warframe was there when I lost my job. Warframe was there when I was depressed. Warframe was always there for me when I had nothing else to turn to. Warframe was also the cause of the terrible things that happened in my life...                ...but that Lato Vandal and Excalibur Proto Armor skin was worth it.   UPDATE: Some people seem to think that the events in this review actually happened. I am sorry for deceiving you.

230410,Warframe,"I used to recommend this game, like a lot, and I wish I could still continue to recommend this game. I really, really do. I love almost everything about it, from its gameplay to its lore to its graphics to its sounds. Even its customization is better than almost any game I've ever seen. I do not easily get addicted to a game, but this game managed it when I first came across it, you can see my proof of that by just looking at how many hours i've put into it.   But, Warframe has been steadily slipping into a downwards spiral. A spiral of extreme grinding.   Don't get me wrong, it gets plenty of content too, and that content is pretty good most of the time. A good example of this was an update called ‘The Second Dream’, which brought with it a quest and a fitting soundtrack that were both truly epic.   But despite all that, Warframe’s grind problem is overshadowing all of that content. It got some ‘Band-Aid fixes’ here and there over its lifespan, but overall it has been steadily getting worse and worse. And now it’s gotten to the point where I really can’t enjoy the game anymore. Warframe as a whole just feels like a giant chore now. Now that’s partially because I’m a veteran and I’ve got not much left to farm for, but this is mostly because of the extreme grind it just forces you through if you want to get anything in this game.  There are other issues, like enemies tending to be nothing more than bullet sponges and annoyances, and the trading/recruiting channels being nothing more than tedious walls of text, but all of them fall into the minor category compared to the grinding problem.  Weapons, Warframes, Prime Items, Special Items, Event Items; at least 80% of the game’s real content is locked behind Time walls, Wait walls, Pay walls and especially RNG- and Grind walls. Now I could totally understand this to some degree, but Warframe has crossed that degree  and then some . With drop chances that rarely reach above 5%, and most missions being very lengthy and tedious, you have to grind so very much, it just becomes ridiculous.  This is even worse for new players, who have to grind  everything  FROM SCRATCH. Not only that, but there is so little in Warframe in terms of tutorials and information, that new players (and sometimes even veteran players) will often find themselves overwhelmed and confused.  No, I’m very sorry DE, but I can no longer recommend Warframe in its current state. It wastes an unforgivable amount of a players time on mind-numbing and monotonous grinding and it ruins the rest of the game. Something really has to change  drastically  in order for me to change my rating and start playing this wonderful game seriously again.   TL;DR:   Pro's:   + Great Visuals,  + Great Sounds and Music,  + Great Gameplay,  + Supreme Customization,  + Free to play,  + Has one of the better communities out there,  + Good lore.  Cons:   - Enemies tend to be nothing more than bullet sponges and/or annoyances,  - Trade- and Recruiting channels are nothing but tedious walls of text,  - Overpriced Market Items, Trading prices and Platinum prices,  - Developers seem to mostly forget about some old content and balance issues - like for example Archwing - in favor of constantly pumping out new content,  - A lack of ingame tutorials and information, to the point where you'll find yourself frequently relying on the Warframe Wiki and other external sources,  - Connectivity and lag issues can become quite common and there's no such thing as dedicated servers,  -  The grind is real! Dear god is it real. It's the main reason I can't recommend this game. ",-1,1

Instead of letting players to have more freedom in advancing to higher lvl, DE pumps out nerfs after nerfs, removing game components, and the only thing they keep on adding are countless of useless items with slightly different stat from eachother, so people think they have a choice. DE used to be nice and friendly but then became so greedy and distant, while all these new players keep pouring in and buying platinums, DE isn't ever going to change. I can't even try to make a point anymore, any discussion criticize the game on the forum alway get bomboarded with negative and toxic responses then get flagged. I tried not to hate it, I tried to keep on playing, but one by one everybody in my shadow clan quit, saying it's just not fun anymore so now it's just me here, all alone.

230410,Warframe,"Haven't played enough to give a thorough review.  Edit (09/07/16) - To all the people whining about Spectres of the Rail.  What exactly did they 'take away' from veterans? We have to actually compleat the rails, like everyone else? Oh no. Boohoo. I have to experience this new system how they intended it to be experienced, while having all the benefits of having every node already unlocked.  Seriously, suck it up guys. This update has brought to the game something it direly needed. Clarity. Enough that anyone new won't have to look at the OLD star-map, and vomit.  Kavats are pretty amazing. They have a very vast array of utility abilities, and WILL be replacing my carrier. (RIP)  Void fissures are a pretty nice way of allowing players to gain void rewards by playing a mission, while having added challenge to get greater rewards. Think about it like a smaller mission, INSIDE another mission. whats that? Veterans lost all their keys!? Yeah. But now we have (I have) 500 different things, to actually use on them!  Games bugged out to hell right now, and I don't disagree there are some game breaking issues, like crashes, freezes, and things that prevent progression. -- My answer to that? Stop banging your head against the wall, and do /something else/. Ya' idjit. I find the crashes funny. Been playing so long without them, the game breaking, and glitching the hell out makes the entire update WORTH WHILE.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"*This review has been edited on 25/12/2016*  You'd think 2K hours, probably spending almost that much money in this game (Maybe more.) and being one of the founders of the game would mean that I love it to death? I did until the Devs changed a bunch of stuff, and started showing signs of bias and corruption within the community.  Good game at its core, albeit pay-to-skip. Has a decent, high octane combat system. It's a great power fantasy game, extremely fun. Gets a bit boring and grindy because you have to farm materials and pieces of gear based on RNG.  I personally don't feel like the Devs listen or care much. They've made many changes I'm not a fan of (In fact, I know a few people who hate the changes more than I do.), and if I ever go back to the game? I refuse to spend another cent on it.  Also, the community drama scene on Youtube with a certain Youtuber who I can't name because Digital Extremes often ban people just for even mentioning his name, being associated with him, or whatever. Just shows how corrupt the developers are since they banned him for doing stuff that their Youtube partners do all of the time, yet they don't get banned. One of them even said on Stream that his fans and the other Warframe YT partners should send a hate mob to this unnamed YT'rs channel. Of course, after he got called out on this (Probably got a finger wagging from Digital Extremes), he tried to take down all evidence of the stream. Classy.  Oh, and new content becomes increasingly more difficult to get, as well as suffers from power creepage. An example: A lot of the new Warframes and weapons require this stuff called Nitain extract. You often need a lot of this stuff just to build this new content, but you can only get it when a mission has been modified into a special kind of mission (Kind of like how it works with the new Relic system) called 'Alert Missions' which only pop up for a few minutes or hours, depending.  Whilst I used to just buy the new stuff since I hate farming, my friends would often complain about how irritating it is to get Nitain simply because the alerts randomly decide when you're allowed to obtain it. You would often need a lot of it too, from my limited understanding, and that's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥.   The game also lacks endgame content. Once you have everything, there's just nothing to do other than help friends grind for the stuff that you got before them or w/e. This game will get boring very fast for you if you've sunk a lot of time and/or money into it.  *EDIT* I should mention the new prime part system, in my opinion? Sucks. It used to be that you would do a level that needed an easy to get key, getting the key and finishing the levels wasn't hard nor did it ever take long. When you finished the level, you would randomly get either a prime part, blueprints, or rare materials based on RNG rolls.  Now? You have to get these stupid relic keys, wait for an alert (kind of like Nitain) that has the class/level of relic that you need for the part that is in the specific drop table that the relic has. THEN you have to not only complete the standard level in its entirety, but you also have to do an annoying and needlessly finnicky minigame where you kill waves of enemies until you grab enough orb things to unlock the relic. Needless change.   The only good thing about the changes in this is that everyone usually gets different parts, and if a squadmate gets something you wanted, but you got something nobody in your squad wanted, you can pick what your squadmate got for free, and he/she would still get their own copy. *END OF EDIT*  I don't mind if you love this game, or hate my review. I'm probably gonna regret writing this. But, meh.  This isn't really me trying to say 'Don't play this game', more so explaining why I've quit. And if it does influence you into not playing this game, or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for my opinions, then so be it.",-1,1

230410,Warframe,"Caution: Overly detailed, so I am very sorry   So I've been playing this game for about 3 years now, and this has easily become one of my most played games that I own. Not even exclusive to steam. Warframe is a game that takes place in space, where you take control of a 'Tenno', which is the faction/race of everyone else that plays. What is a Tenno? Well... play for yourself, and you'll find out with time. -wink-  'What is a Warframe?'  Warframes are the battle-suits that you control. You walk as them, you fight as them, you hang out as them...you pretty much ARE the Warframe. (Yes, I told you that you are a Tenno as well. Like I said, it's just a suit. It's complicated.) There are currently 29 different Warframes to collect/build and use, each with their own unique set of flashy abilities. I say 'currently' because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates (also, one of the most enjoyable development teams I've ever seen, tbh), and the community helps shape the game greatly.   Anyhow, the Warframes are battle-suits for a reason. In this game, you are a freaking ninja, in probably the most ninja way possible. From wall jumps, slides, air-kicks, backflips, gliding, rolling, super jumps, throwing stars, dual daggers, etc.. You name it, it's probably possible. There is so much movement and control, you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system. There is also so much customization in this game. Assault rifles, rocket launchers, bows, crossbows, sniper rifles, shotguns, laser-beams, sawblade launchers, wormhole creators, grenade launchers, laser cannons, lightning shooters, gas cloud launchers, laser-rifles, infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks, freeze-rays, and much more. Also, most of what I just listed are primary weapons, meaning you ALSO have secondary weapons, which are your sidearms, and melee weapons. There are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms, but if you are an in-your-face type of player, then enjoy your collection of melee weapons, including single swords, dual swords, katanas, daggers, glaives, bo staffs, polearms, hammers, axes, whips, whip/blade combos, energy-blades--well, you get the point by now. There are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well. Another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own, from warframes, weapons, companions (little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilities..or, you know, a cat or a dog.), armor pieces and scarfs (this game is called Fashionframe by the community for a reason), and even your own ship.  Your ship serves as your personal hub, where you can access the star chart for missions, your arsenal, your foundry (for building weapons, warframes, gear, and everything else), your mods, and more. What are mods? Mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game, some mods being specific to certain enemies. They also have tiers of rarity. Anyway, mods are a very important feature, and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons. There are hundreds of different mods, ranging from additional health percentages, additional damage, elemental damage (which you can mix different elements to form new elements, might I add), ability range, and just...pretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more. Want a silenced loadout for stealth? There are mods for that. Screw stealth, you want explosions? Mods.  'Who are the bad guys?'  There are a handful of different factions in the game, mostly all of them against the Tenno.  There are the Grineer, who are crude, ugly, bulky clones of other Grineer, made to produce a massive army. Usually found in their battleships, or their own settlements, destroying the planet's landscape with machinery. They look dumb, but can be pretty tough.  Another faction is the Corpus, who are driven by greed. They are more technologically advanced than the Grineer, using robotics, drones, and lasers in their favor.   The Infested is another faction. They are...a bit of a mess. Disgusting heaps and masses of flesh, screeching as they charge to attack. They are basically zombified, destroyed forms of Grineer and Corpus, but you really don't see them that way, considering how mutilated they become. They don't have much of a role other than to spread the virus, and, most importantly, kill you.  There are a couple of other factions, but they are a bit spoiler-y, so I'll avoid talking about them.  'Why are we doing any of this in the first place?'  Because Space-mom tells you to, and you must listen to Space-mom.   '....who tf is space-mom?'  Upon the Tenno's awakening, you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of Lotus, who first appears to be an AI of sorts, although taking a humanoid form. You have no memory of anything before this 'awakening', so you should probably listen to her.  She guides and cares for the entire Tenno faction, alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system. She is your leader.  'So what is the main objective, overall?' +bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise  Really, it's anything you want. A lot of players get lost because they don't know what they should be doing, but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions, which you can invite friends to. Also, this is a very heavy co-op based game, so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad (or up to 8 in raid missions). You can play this game completely solo if you want, of course. It will be pretty challenging, though.  So let's start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It's more of a 'pay-to-progress-faster' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I'm out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this.",1,1

I enjoyed this game, I really did, I can tell you exactly what I liked and exactly what got me to stop playing make the choice on your own for if the game is worth your time though. Things I really really liked about the game, and why you should play it:  It's free  It has an interesting arcade shooter puzzle dungeon layout feel thing going on. It has tons of goals to keep you going Kubrows are adorable You can play how you like, if you like stealth go stealthy, if you like running and gunning go do that. aaaaaaaaaaaaand you don't HAVE to buy anything you can earn Prime blueprints from the void and sell them to  suckers  other players for platinum. Generally enjoyable.  Things that pushed me away from the game: I guess the only thing that really got me was when I was waiting for the next mission but I had to go through the next few planets to get there....

230410,Warframe,"Firstly lets talk about the basics, Warframe is a third-person over the shoulder Shooter, in it you control your character and complete missions and quests taking place on the different planets in the solar system, and if that sounds pretty generic thats because it probably is, however you are not some generic soldier, you take control of the Tenno, a race of basically humans designed as living weapons by a long dead ancient race, who are lead by The Lotus (space mum) to keep the peace in the solar system.  Lets talk about the gameplay, The controls are pretty standard (WASD to move, Space to jump etc.), but theres actually a bit more to it than running around and shooting, some missions require you to be stealthy instead of aggressive, and since the Tenno are basically space ninjas you'd expect them to be able to pull of some acrobatics, and youd be right, its almost impossible to go anywhere without pulling off a little parkour in some of the missions. Now we come to the characters themselves, the Warframes, these are robotic suits-ish that the Tenno control and complete missions with, now theres actually a large amount of these ranging from healing ones, to defensive ones, stealthy ones, and aggressive one, each one coming with its own unique set of abilities, stats and look. There are no real 'Good' Warframes as they are all good in there own way and who am i to tell you how to play your game. So just go out, find one that you like, and have fun.  So the fact that Warframe is a free game might put you off, and yes even though warframe has a currency that is obtained by paying real money, but that does not mean this game is Pay To Win, this is because you are allowed to freely trade said currency with other players for their items, so if you dont want to use real money but you want an item that you can only get with the currency, then all you need to do is farm for a little bit, and sell of the items you got to players that want them, meaning that every single item can be obtained without having to pay any real money.  All in all I highly reccomend you at least give Warframe a try, I mean, what harm can it do.  tl:dr Good game, basic controls, basically 100% free to play, space mums included, check it out",1,1

230410,Warframe,"I guess it was fun while it lasted. It's hard for me to write this after so long.  To begin with, the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed.  We started playing Warframe with my friends when it was not on Steam yet, like almost 4 years ago. None of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time.  Developers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what. Game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band-aid fix is released which doesn't adress the issue itself. Broken enemy armor and health scaling, useless weapons and Warframes aka mastery fodder, energy management is non existant, most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or OP due to superb CC capability or straight invulnerability etc. and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on.  Every once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two. Two-three weeks after it's been released and almost nobody uses it, and there's a plenty of such cases (Archwing, Dark Sectors, Conclave, Kubrows, Syndicates, Maroo's Bazaar, Focus... seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced Lunaro)  Grind, oh god, grind increases exponentially with each new update. I feel really bad for newer players. Devs tell they want to change the situation where old-time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. And how they fix it - they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called Cryotic. To explain, you can get like 100 Cryotic in 2-3 minutes maximum if you're good at only type of missions where you can get it - excavation. There you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one-shot by high level enemy (there's enemy damage scaling issues too, yup). Not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one. After community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue, devs release new Primed Warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource (Oxium) of 14000 (by similar I mean the way to obtain it - you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best, and there are not too many of those enemies). After another community uproar it was changed to 7000, which is still a huge amount for many people, and more so for newer players.  Also Void, a place where Primed ('glorified') versions of Warframes and weapons drop. There were already many Prime Warframes released, and some of them have already been 'vaulted' (taken out of drop tables). The official reason for that is there isn't too much space in Void mission for many Primed Warframes and weapons, and not to create dilution in drop tables some Primes were vaulted. But from dev-team's actions you can guess the real reason is different. There are several mission types in the Void that have little to no Prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago, thus intentionally diluting Void mission rewards.  Also devs tend to put most desirable Primed parts into most boring and long (20 min) missions in the Void. And the chance for this part is like 5% or so, and guess what? It's 5% for one of 5 different parts, making it 1% (if you're lucky) for the exact part you want. I guess it's okay that people don't want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need. Not to go too much into details, I'd say Void missions are not the only missions that have this problem.  Recently there was an update addressing most of OP Warframe abilities, and that seems to be causing another community uproar now, as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those OP abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics. I'm not sure how high level missions (Sorties) or raids (aka Trials) will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more, especially when you barely scratch the enemy's health (lvl 100+ enemies). Endgame here is like it's either you relying on those OP abilities to keep you alive or you get one-two shot the moment you fail to do so.  TL;DR - Devs produce more and more content (and bugs and broken mechanics too) and seems like they forget of even 2-3 month old content - Ever incresing grind, with latest updates - exponentially - Warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these 'OP' abilities - Many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed",-1,1

230410,Warframe,"TL;DR at the bottom. Main features at the bottom before TL;DR   Cons: 1. Pretty bad tutorial. The tutorial simply guides you through basic combat, and nothing more. The more complicated mechanics such as mods and damage types are barely touched on. These two main mechanics are crucial in-game, and due to the lack of a tutorial for it, I've encountered far too many new players who are clueless. You will have to google for a crap ton of information. (Bless the wiki page)  2. Pay-4-Convenience. If you're rich, you get through majority of the game faster. But it is NOT Pay-2-Win. Everything is obtainable, and the grind isn't insane unless RNGesus hates you. A person who paid money and a free-to-play player will end up with the exact same gear. Essentially, you buy time in this game, and nothing more.  3. Limited areas to play in. It's not open-world. Instances have a certain tileset for each planet. It randomizes, but generally remains the same. There are, of course, new tilesets added in certain updates.  4. It's easy to get burnt out. By burnt out, I mean that you'll probably play the game on and off when you first start. This is due to the long waiting times for crafting new items, which are the only way you can get new items on your own. That tied with the daily trade limit makes it difficult to play for several hours straight. But once you've attained a fair amount of items, getting burnt out becomes few and far between.  5. You're free to do what you want. This can't be a bad thing, right? But it is for those who want some form of direction in a game. I initially found it really hard to stick to playing this game. I love every aspect of it, but having no actual goal is painful. This game is recommended for those who like loot-based games like Diablo 3.   Pros: 1. Everything is obtainable if you play the game. (With the exception of the Founders Pack) Yeah, play the game and get everything. Simple as that. Wanna get something that is no longer available? Trade.   2. Fantastic Graphics on low-end PCs I'm able to run this on a PC with only 2GB of RAM and an Intel Graphics card. I've upgraded since then, but it runs at a smooth 30 FPS on that disgusting old rig.  3. Gameplay. Gameplay doesn't get dull, unless you're one of those cancerous people who plays Ash-hole. Fast paced, and both melee-only and ranged-only builds are viable.   4. The Dev team. It's clear that the Warframe dev team cares about the game and does not try to turn it into a cash-grab. New expansion? Free. New item being released? Don't need to fork up any money. New mission? Do the pre-reqs and gain access to it. Entirely new mechanic that could possibly act as DLC? FREEEEE.  5. Community. You will rarely ever encounter any cancer players. Why? Because Warframe heavily relies on working with others. If you're a horrible person to group with, you'll build up a bad rep and eventually no one will group with you. The downsides of being an ♥♥♥ are so huge, that if Kanye played this game, you'd think he's Oprah or Ellen or one of those nice people that everyone likes.   Features + A lot of 'Warframes' which act as classes (extremely flexible) + Detailed mechanics (modding, damage 2.0) + Large amount of viable weapons (majority are extremely different from each, all are able to be molded to endgame) + Fantastic graphics (recently got a revamp with better smoke and fire physics) + Incredibly optimized (expect smooth framerates throughout) + Plenty of customization and cosmetics (you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you)  - Dull movement system (despite having a parkour system, you'll be rolling/bullet jumping everywhere. This is starting to change with the added Orokin Moon Tileset) - Limited areas to play in - Repetitive (very limited number of mission types) - PvP is pointless (you don't get much other than cosmetics) - Ridiculously grindy - A lot of flukes (there are certain builds that do all the work by pressing A SINGLE BUTTON. I kid you not. Check out 'Warframe draco runs' on youtube.) - Limited trades each day (tallies with your Mastery Rank, which you can increase by leveling items) - Limited inventory (appears as a cash grab quite early on, but you can earn Platinum through trading) - Certain items are obtainable at certain times (2 main items; orokin catalyst and orokin reactor. They are untradable, and I've personally wasted over 400 Platinum on the market buying them because I missed an alert that was only available for 1 HOUR. The recipe that can be bought on the market is stupid)  TLDR; It's free, but can appear as P2W.  You can obtain everything if you spend time and effort. Play if you like loot-based games. Expect to wait. A lot. Community is awesome. Devs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes. Being a Helicopter with dual axes is fun (yes you can do that in this game)",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Having over 1000 hours of this masterpiece of a game probably gives me the privellege to finally create a 'proper' review of it.   Sadly I am not privelleged enough to talk to women in public, being the mysagonist that I am    The focus of this review is going to be on the developers of the game and their means to communicate with their playerbase, rather than focusing on anything in game like: Graphics, Story, Gameplay, etc. which are subjects that i could ramble over for literally days.   So if you seek any information on what this game is really about you should probably take a closer look at reviews either above or below this one    It definetly is an odd subject to talk about, but it's the main reason why i love this game with a passion as big as the rings of Saturn.  So why not just give you a background story of these developers ?   'You will fail' The Digital Extremes Story",1,1
230410,Warframe,"This game is a game where prety much EVERYTHING can be obtained through trade and patience. I have reached the point of the game where all I have left to do is collect a few weapons and cosmetics, in which I have made the money (platinum) for on my own time. As a high ranking player, I have seen many types of players and many changes throughout the game. The gameplay and trading in Warframe are merciless to those who start out the game, but provides an interesting learning experience to read the minds of the person on the other side of the screen. It took me a couple of hours to just figure out the parkour mechanics, and many more to be able to hold my ground against enemies that you may think are stupid at first, but then realize that they are stupid, but hit hard. Even with the legendary grind this game has striked into players, I remain playing the game, seeing new content put out that never fails to impress. If you are looking for a game where you can casually spend time with friends, be astounded by the copypasta maps that always hold great beauty, laugh at the funny bugs that can be found on rare occassions, fight for the 'honor' of the merciless tenno, or find a challenge mastering the game's distinct mechanics and unmatched third-person combat, then I welcome you to join Warframe.",1,1
230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a free to play TPS / hack 'n slash co-op game with stealth and parkour elements. In it the player becomes one of the Tenno, space ninjas awakened from a long slumber, who control powerful suits known as Warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from Lotus.  The graphics are just incredible. Each location has its own design style, the environments are shiny and rich in details, while the special effects are just plain beautiful. The only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight.  In the sound department, the music is appriopriate to the situation (speeds up when in a fight, for example) and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction you're fighting against (though it can get overriden by the boss' theme if someone like that appears). A few of the tracks deserve a mention for being just plain incredible, such as Drums of War, Becoming the Hunted, Cold and Gold, We Are Not Alone, Reap What You Sow and   This Is What You Are  . The sound effects aren't anything special, but they are diverse enough to not get boring or tiring. The voice acting is also really good, even if a bit scarce.  The gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective (like killing all enemies or capturing important targets) while moving through randomly-generated rooms. You get to use between three weapons - primary, secondary and melee (which can be of many different types, like bows, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shurikens, kunais, swords, axes, hammers, polearms, scythes, glaives, knuckles, gunblades.. yeah, this game has  tons upon tons  of weapons) - as well as an assortment of movement options, including, but not limited to sprinting, sliding, wall-running etc. You can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers, giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike.  As far as stealth elements go, you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies. You can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance, or sneak up behind them and perform an insta-kill stealth execution. Some abilities can also make you invisible or silence everything within a certain radius. The mechanics are very solid and it's fun slicing stuff down.  There is also the Archwing and its own missions, where you move in no-gravity using the eponymous mechanical wings, shooting down foes akin to a space shooter. While it isn't as diverse as the standard gamemode, it is a good change of pace from time to time. Not to mention, even more awesome.  The amount of equipment, types of environments, and missions you can encounter is staggering. The diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale.  Another good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well - even with high ping, you will notice an obvious delay, but it won't impact your experience or general gameplay as much as in some other games.  Story-wise, the game isn't really all that rich, but it is solid nonetheless. There is a lot of lore in transcripts and descriptions of some weapons and Warframes, and the quests also provide an interesting narrative as far as the identity of Lotus and the Tenno themselves goes, as well as what happened in the past and what the player characters did before they were put to cryosleep. I'm not going to be spoiling anything, as you should discover it yourself, particularly when it comes to the newest Second Dream quest.  I think this is it for the pros, so let's start counting out the cons. The game is still, quite obviously, a glorified grind to get better stuff. Fortunately, most of the time it's somewhat fun to play.  Speaking about multiplayer, if the host's computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game, you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy, with everything 'flash stepping' all over the place.  Another bad thing is the fact that enemies are pretty stupid sometimes. They tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots, or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover, just being covered from the wrong direction. Harder missions only strengthen the enemies' stats together with spawning elites more often, and sometimes new types of enemies.  Also another thing is that the game requires a LOT of grinding to even get moderately powerful. At the beginning you're going to struggle to complete the missions that aren't the absolute simplest of all, since you don't have much resources to manufacture new stuff, and the starting equipment is very weak. And even if you do get strong weapons, they're not going to be powerful enough without a good assortment of high-rank mods for them to customize their damage output. Of course, if you have a friend who's been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started, this becomes a bit less of an issue.  The amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited. While it isn't so bad with weapon and sentinel slots, you get only two Warframe slots for starters, kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team. You really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things.  The last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy. Objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up, or you can land outside the map and fall into the Void to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike. And this isn't an uncommon occurence.  Overall, this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning, but very fun game once you get far enough. You should check it out if you don't mind a sluggish beginning, especially if you've got more experienced friends who can help you get running.",1,1

230410,Warframe,"So, I've been playing Warframe for around 2 years now, and I have to say I've had fun.  It wouldn't be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one I have, so I'm presenting facts as objectively as I can here in as fair of an environment as I can.   Warframe is a scifi third-person action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids. It essentially feels like a cross-over between older fast paced games like Quake and Unreal Tournament, with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter.  That being said, I can't call into question the fun other people have playing this game, so I can't consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not. But I can say it's fair to judge other factors, for example...  This game is based heavily around 'Modding', the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately, and Crafting, the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies / broken containers or enemy storage lockers, to build things like weapons and characters to use. It takes a very long time to gather these materials, and because of this, it has been referred to as 'Farming' when a player repeatedly runs the same mission, or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it.  Now, here's where my reasoning comes in as to why I don't like this game as much as I could. It takes too long.  I am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer, so I haven't had to buy much in this game using the in-game currency Platinum ( which is purchased with real world money ).  Now, that's fine. Having micro-transactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay, because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work.  What's not okay is something Warframe players refer to as RNGesus, the Random Number Generator. What's also not okay is the extensive nature of 'Farming'. A significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a 'grindwall', or rather, an extensive task or list of tasks that MUST be performed before you can access certain parts of the game. This is not as bad as DLC, and it isn't as bad as micro-transactions in some other games, but it can be fairly irksome at times. All in all, this game is fair about how it treats many things, especially how it treats micro-transactions ( in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort ) except for one problem...  Pricing.  It effectively costs anywhere between $2 to $15 to straight-up buy a weapon or Warframe in this game. This is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem, the value of time. Calling into question the fairness of the pricing of micro-transactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time. Is it worth spending $10 to get a weapon now, or is it worth spending anywhere between a few hours to a few days to collect the credits and resources to buy it, then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft? Is it worth spending $15 to get a Warframe ( Playable Character ) immediately plus bonuses, or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources, then waiting approximately 4-5 days on average for it to build?  The problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it, typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things, I could have done much more in other games, or even worse, for $15 I could've bought an entire other game.  I admit that Warframe is technically still in beta, and that many things still do need to be complete, but this does not feel like a beta game any longer. There is a huge quantity of content in this game, which I would easily value as being worth well over $40 ( Generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign + no straight up form of sandbox, as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your Liset, which is essentially your 'main menu' of sorts. ) The audio quality is impressive, and the visuals are even moreso; The animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at, though the game is very lackluster in the way of animations for other weapons. The vast majority of weapons fall into only a specific set of holdtypes / animation sets, with the reload being the only animation that's different in a lot of cases. All primaries are held like a rifle or a bow, all secondaries are held like a pistol, two pistols, or a gauntlet / power-arm of some kind, and a significant number of weapons recycle the same reloading animation.  [ There used to be a snippet here about recycled assets; They don't do this anymore. ]  The enemies in this game are not always fair, though in most cases it's thankfully relatively situational. For some examples...  Nullifiers are a Corpus enemy that project a large spherical field that completely negates all abilities and halts bullets ( Though does not halt Area of Effect [AoE] damage. ) Their protective shield shrinks when damaged, though there is a limit to how far it will shrink from a single instance of damage, and as such the user is highly encouraged to use weapons they are potentially very uncomfortable with in order to deal with this one very exclusive and specific enemy. The only other significantly time-efficient alternative is to approach the Nullifier in melee range, which opens you up for counterattack from enemies.  Knockdowns are a very frequently used tactic in this game, both from players and from enemies, ranging from Impact and Blast being used to knock over or completely knock enemies away, or in less fortunate cases, used by enemies to knock YOU over, and knock YOU away. In most instances, knockdown is avoidable with enough map awareness and enemy awareness, but the much more immediate problem resides in the quantity of knockdowns and their presence during much larger fights. Enemies with plenty of knockdowns within their utility kit are typically encountered much more frequently during higher level missions in higher quantities when all enemies are uniformly more present, making it very difficult to continue to keep an eye on the entire battlefield as a whole.  Then there's the scaling issue, and the arguement of utility versus damage. As it stands, the most effective weapons in this game are generally either VERY utility, or VERY damaging, with very little inbetween. The most effective weapons tend to either be semi-automatic / burst / fully automatic rifles or shotguns, explosive launchers, while the less conventional weapons such as trap layers or flame-throwers / freeze-rays tend to be much less effective to the point of rarely being used in Endgame. I understand that not everyone might see this as a problem, but if a player happens to take a liking to a particular weapon, they may end up finding that their favourite weapon falls off and becomes completely and utterly worthless in higher level missions regardless of how they try to build it, because of how enemies gain health and gain shields and gain armour endlessly without ever offering any significant weaknesses to compensate for the increasingly bullet-sponge-y behaviour, or offering any respite for players using weaker weapons by choice.  And on a final note, the community isn't exactly the best either, a significant portion of the time. It generally is ill-advised to run with public matches, due to both troubles with being left behind by speedrunners, or being talked down upon by 'better' players ( read: Higher mastery rank. ) regardless of context.   All in all, I can't really recommend this game to people who either lack free time, or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be arguably described as an unfairly balanced environment.",-1,1
230410,Warframe,"I started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game, I changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended; and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review. It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it.  Instead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened.  What it really boils down to is this:  The company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story.   In my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored.

230410,Warframe,"Now half of you will just rate the review unhelpful because it's negative, but be reminded that every one of these problems is something I want to be fixed, not that I laugh about, read on if you care, or be one of the many who would disregard what I say because they think it's bad to point out issues, and will blindly follow Warframe to the depths of hell itself to shoot down critisizm.  Look at my hours, I know what I'm talking about.   Off-putting Community with really short-sighted Devs.   First The Positives,  +It's free to play, (With some restrictions.)  +Playing with friends can be a lot of fun, the problem is trying to get them to play the game with you. (It's harder than you might think)  +Combat is fun, albeit a bit buggy at times.  +Weapons and frames a quite varied, making almost every item a new experience.  +Not bad in terms of graphics, everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey, it's a free game.   Now the Negatives...   -The game is an infinite power creep.  -The forums, I have never met such a nasty group of people in my life.  -The game doesn't have too much grinding, the game IS grinding, you are grinding to grind more.  -The game is ridiculously easy, you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month.  -The paywalls, unless you only want to have two Warframes, you gotta pay up, that or attempt the horrible trading system.  -The generic enemies of clones and spacemen, most of the concepts are quite unoriginal. The enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes, or just generic space zombies straight out of something like Halo or Dead Space.  -The AI barely makes enemies a threat, they will suicide rush you solo, all while getting slaughtered.  -The bugs, this is a beta game but good god, it's been out for 2 years, they simply neglect to fix them. Hell, sometimes they create more bugs than they fix. These things are so rampant, it actually makes a SERIOUS impact on the games sometimes, from camera issues to getting stuck in walls, bugs ruin SO much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes.  -The balancing, DE couldn't balance a seesaw, some items are worthless, others OP to the extreme. The developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames, they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone, while nerfing random items that very clearly didn't need it. It makes no sense, the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring. They also just straight up ignore useless frames and items, theres nothing more to say, they just ignore them.  -The updates, most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game, or a useless gun.  -The end goal, if you don't care about a number next to your name, there is none  -The asskissing, DE will release a patch to fix something THEY broke, and people thank the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, yeah sure, that makes sense, not to mention ANY critisism of ANY of their decisions, (no matter how stupid they are) will be shot down by their White Knights  -The gameplay, stealth is a neglected factor entirely, the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage, any other gamemode is just killing ♥♥♥♥ with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of over-powered weapon.  -The devs greed, they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new Prime package and find more ways to suck your money out, (Like slots, for example)  -The idiotic community, just go look at the wiki, every page's comments has someone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a weapon and telling you some other one is better, they just bicker endlessly about everything.  -The matchmaking, there isn't any, you have to go sit in a chat room, (Unless you join a clan, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE!) and wait for some Rhino Prime to join your game, unless you're doing normal missions, cause then you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time, you're doomed to play it solo.  -The money creep of cosmetics, every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last, you know why DE does this? Cause they know their brain-dead community will eat it the ♥♥♥♥ up, and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing 'THANKS DE' into their keyboard as hard as they can.  -The lack of progress with updates, sure they come often, but seriously, they give us random weapons that who's gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be out-classed. The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant.  -The lack of variety in gamemodes, there's like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever.  -The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I'll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats.  -The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it's incredibly common.  -The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long.  -The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular.  -The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it's completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  -The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry.  -The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored.  -The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated.  -The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don't even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else.  -The most ignorant developers I've ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that's bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard in my life to be honest.  If you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who don't care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out.  The more people who dislike this only proves what I'm talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them.   Fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.",-1,1
230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a amazing mastery based multiplayer game. You can choose from hundreds of weapons and 29+ warframes. The good part is that you can mod those however you like, you can choose from thousands of different mods. The game has some grinding elements but the developers are trying to get away from grinding in the future. New stuff is added everytime, DE updates the game regularly with more stuff for you to collect and balances to weapons and warframes. You can play with up to 3 friends and there are a lot of gamemodes so you won't get bored, if you don't have friends don't worry, there is a good matchmaking system that will find you a party to play with. You also have a campaign and a lot of bosses to beat. Don't get scared by the premium currency, the game is TOTTALY not pay2win, a paying user has nothing over you, you can get anything without money. As a player with 300+ hours i never added money in to the game and i managed to get all the prime warframes and 1500 platinum cash just from trading.

230410,Warframe,"I have played this game for two years, and have ambivalently enjoyed it. There are many things it does really well -- the action and feel is great, when it's great. And it's got personality, complete with your missiongiver (the Lotus) being creepily manipulative and codependent, and your ship's AI being hilariously Tourettesy and sullen. The good parts have been good enough to overlook a lot of really irritating things.  But, after years of playing this, I have to turn my thumbs down given the path it's been on for quite a long time. The good has been shrinking rapidly in proportion to the bad, and, given that a game like this is one you play for the long haul, I can't recommend it to anyone starting out. As time goes on, at least in the two years I've been playing, it has only become *more* buggy, *more* tedious and *less* rewarding, to the point where I wonder if the devs respect their playerbase.  Problems (short version):  1) The game has longstanding, serious game-ruining bugs that do not get addressed, while new content introduces new embarrassingly-bad bugs that should not have survived beta testing. They just don't seem interested in fixing them.  2) The game is a grindfest, and that's part of the game and has been for a long time, and that's fine within reasonable bounds. But the reward curve has been getting worse while the game has been getting more tedious and requiring more mind-numbing repetition of missions not interesting enough to sustain that repetition.  3) In their quest to extend game life and make more challenge, the devs have been creating artificial difficulty by, for example, creating missions that are long and tedious, and, rather than requiring skill, require patience as the players repeatedly engage in Skinner-box behaviors until the mission is finally complete.   Putting 2) and 3) together, the game is becoming a less- and less-rewarding Skinner box, and it's known as Trollframe to many players now because of its irritating non-rewards after extended, much-repeated tedious missions.  Problems (long version):  1) The devs seem to have become sloppier and sloppier. Pretty much all new content is patched in with insufficient testing, and serious game-degrading/session-ruining bugs and frustrating glitches go uncorrected. Most recent case has been the change of how enemies spawn in Extermination-type missions, in which you have to kill all enemies on the map to complete it. Apparently, the devs found that some players had figured out how to complete these missions more quickly by stealthing them, making them able to grind faster. Horrors! So the devs immediately implemented a change that staggers them differently and makes some spawn well-behind the players -- sometimes at the mission start! -- making for a lot of time-consuming backtracking. It also makes it so not all enemies are spawned by the time the players reach the final room of the mission, so the players just sit there from 3-10 minutes waiting for them to spawn in onesies and twosies. It's disproportionately frustrating, like an extended, interactive loading screen that just sits there for a long time but requires your continued attention to progress. This change has not been retracted 3 months after the fact, and it's not fixed. Why not test it before putting it into production, or withdraw it until fixed, if it contains a serious bug?  There are lots of things like this. There are a lot of bugs that just don't get addressed, and some of them (like falling out of the map, which happens more frequently than it should) have no in-game remedy and are mission-ruiners.  On the other hand, if there is a grinding shortcut, the devs are ON that, lickety-split. So, instead of fixing the backspawning problem (making the player run all the way back to early parts of the mission to kill a newly-spawned mob, making the mission take a couple minutes longer with what amounts to a fetch quest) that has annoyed players for at *least* two years, they instead introduced *more* spawn delay and backspawn to thwart players that might be able to cleverly shave a minute or two off a mission (and, interestingly, completely avoid the backspawning bug). From this, I can only infer that backspawning is intentional, and what bothers them is when players can *avoid* experiencing it. Your priorities are showing, DE. That one right there gets them a big middle finger from me.  2) The game has been increasingly oriented toward endless, frustrating grinding with worse and worse chances of getting desired item drops -- it's been getting worse, such that these days people commonly refer to it as Trollframe. The game is grinding-oriented -- we all know this. But the devs have increasingly been orienting the content such that it involves this sort of grinding: so-and-so mission will be available for 7 days, and you can only get X item from it. You need to collect all its pieces from repeating a long, tedious mission, which has a random chance to drop them as its end-mission reward. They've set up the drop tables (percentage chances of getting each item at the end) so you can get a couple of the items reasonably, but one of the items has a very low percentage chance to drop, so you pile up extras of the first parts while you get silly junk items the other half of the time. So you repeat this mission twenty, thirty, forty times, til you're numb with it and despise it, but you're pressing that twenty-minute Skinner box button sequence hoping for the thing. Grinding can be fun and engaging, but they've pushed the envelope too far.  3) In terms of actual gameplay, there's been an irritating trend toward more tedious and irritating missions and enemies. The latest one at the time of this writing, the giant robot-dog Razorback, is a mission filled with bugs and made artificially long and tedious. It's not difficult once you know how to do it, but it takes forever because of the way it is strucured (press this button, wait for bursa robot to jump down, knock him down and hack him, wait for him to disable Razorback's defenses, now shoot Razorback in a 2-second time window that isn't really very clear when it starts so you might miss it, and repeat 6 to 30 times depending on player DPS and other factors).  Eh, I'm tired of the game looking more and more like a literal Skinner box -- that Razorback mission is almost humorously literal in being one. Except we only have a small chance of getting our birdseed at the end, and I'm tired of doing it.  Nope, can't recommend it. Devs are reaching into more and more questionable game mechanics and feedback mechanisms to extend its life, and it's become a burnout-inducing tedium-fest.",-1,1
230410,Warframe,"A good free to play game that doesn't push Microtransactions in your face every five mins and is actually a decent game.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Is it a good game ? Yes. Is it a good sequel ? No.  Killing Floor 1 was a better game back in its time. Even now it's a better game if you can stand the potato graphics. It felt more satisfying and gritty. All they had to do was take the first game, slap HD graphics and maybe some new weapons and maps, and call it a day.   I don't know why they went for this weird futuristic style instead of the old gritty apocalypse style, I don't know why they added the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ VS mode that nobody ever gave a ♥♥♥♥ about, and they also added some microtransaction crates which is kinda lame but fine I guess as long as it's cosmetics. Old paid skin packs were better, you bought only what you wanted.  At its core Killing Floor 2 is still good fun though. It's got great graphics, and you can still dismember monsters with your friends through various means. If like me you played KF1 and stopped long ago because you got bored or moved on to other games, then play KF2. If you've never played any Killing Floor game before, then play KF2 as well, it's brand new and shiny.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"I've been playing this game since the very first day it was released on early access. Back then it was very bare bones and only had 4 classes in the game. I have had the chance of seeing it grow and change drastically over the years, finally culminating into the complete game we have now. I believe that game is worth buying.  This is a very enjoyable co-operative first person shooter. You and 5 other people try to survive against increasingly challenging waves of ''zeds''; cloned monstrosities set loose upon the world by the Horzine Corporation. The soundtrack is death metal and it's bloody as hell. It's a very cathartic experience.   There is an extremely large and varied arsenal of weapons to choose from split between 10 classes. The developpers, Tripwire, used to be infamous for their long development times and lack of communication with the community but they've definitely addressed that problem recently. Updates are frequent and fast, and they always release new images and previews to let people know what they're working on. Even though the game left early access, it's still going to be constantly upgraded.   The 10 perks can all be leveled up to level 25, which can take a bit. Furthermore, there are several difficulty levels that drastically alter the gameplay ( they change the zed behavior, making them more deadly) as well as custom maps. All of those things add tons of replay value to the game.   Don't know what else there is to say about Killing Floor 2. It's not the most complicated of games but it has tons of content, replay value and fun. You should get it if you like fun.",1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2," Took a while, but we're here lads; full release.  TL;DR at bottom.   What is KF2?",1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"So probably first of all I should say I really enjoyed the original. So much that I actually got all 285 achievements in it, hence you might assume I was quite excited when they announced the sequel. The game is everything the original was with a handful of enhacements to the gameplay itself and several new features like character customization to stand out from another person who might be using the same character.  Core gameplay remains the same, so fans of the original will get what they expected with an added challenge as the difficulty has been ramped up thanks to the new AI and map design. There essentially are no safe spots and enemies seem to crowd you even more than in the original title. You want a challenge? You will definitely get one with this game.  Speaking of difficulties, the only thing you ever see in a game with difficulty increase is one or more of the following: Enemies have higher HP, deal more damage or there are simple more of them than on a lower difficulty. Now this game changes everything about this cheap standard as in Killing Floor 2 with higher difficulty, also changes the bahaviour of the AI and the enemies get entirely new attack sets that you never see them using on let's say 'Normal' difficulty. The enemies, get more aggressive, attack more, get enraged more and tend to run instead of just slowly walking at you. This is a really unexpected and intriguing development in the game world.  If we consider the technical side, of course, there is a bug here and there to be found but visuals are impressive and you can't really complain about the performance either. However, be warned that this developer, as many others these days, do not support integrated graphics cards, so if you are on a laptop chances are the game won't work at all for you.  Also, the game uses the integrated card by default so be sure to change to high performance in your control panel before playing it.   Now you might wonder why it is in Early Access if it plays so great? Well quite simply it is a finished product with a lack of content. There is quite a selection of weapons to choose from (almost 30) but there are only 3 maps to play on and even though the 4 perks (classes) that are present in the game work perfectly together, those are only 4 of the planned 10 perks in the game currently.   So in conclusion , the game runs perfectly fine, visuals are great, soundtrack is fitting for the massive killing that happens in the game and amazingly incorporated too, replay value is as high as it can possibly get in a game and entertainment levels are over 9000 but the downside is the current lack of content. Even so it will keep you playing for quite some hours, especially if you are gonna want to level those perks up.  If Killing Floor 2 was a zed itself, then figuratively you could easily say that KF1 is its skeleton and the new additions are its meat, and we all know the meat is the good part here ;)",1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Killing Floor 2. Where to begin.. Well first things first I should give a little background. I currently have roughly 250 hours played in this game, I purchased it during Early Access prior to the release of the Firebug and Demolitionist perks, roughly a year ago. I've played every perk in the game on every main map and tried innumerable custom maps, I'm sure there are those with far more time invested than me but I'd say I'm pretty up there considering.  I love solid horde mode shooters, I know many find them stale or repetitive but I could play a good one ad nauseum and never get bored. Even if it has no 'progression treadmill' or loot rewards, if the game play is fun I will keep comming back. As such Killing Floor 2 should be right up my alley.. and it is.. for the most part.   First, The Positives:",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"So, before I begin, let me point something out.  Once a game gets out of EA, the reviews from EA stop affecting the game, so while the 'Overall' say very positive, keep in mind theres plenty, and I mean plenty, of negative reviews on this game.  And mine was one of them, but since the game is out, I will review it as a whole game  Pros -Beautiful and fluid gameplay, melee feels like it impacts, bullets do too, enemies come apart when they die, coupled with Zed time, blowing a scrake in half with a double barrel shotgun has never been more satisfying.   -Nice assortment of weapons, not as many as we expected from EA promises, but its not horrible. You can bet DLC will come out adding more as it did in the first game. Classes like the gunslinger and swat make a nice addition, nerfing the sharpshooter by splitting it in 2 and adding a tanky alternative to the berserker who has some range.  -Nice selection of maps, not as big or grand as Killing floor 1, but they have more details.  -Some of the most fun coop horde gameplay around, especially with the ability to jump into private games or make dedicated servers. -Makes you want to play killing floor 1 again.  Cons - Features we expected from early access were left out. Granted nothing was 'Promised' from EA, but we typically expect to get what is hinted at or teased. Some of the classes promised (Martial artist for instance) not included at all. Instead added 'The Survivalist' A class that essentially breaks the class system and just gives you random bonuses from other classes. -Only 1 extra boss introduced in EA.   -(For those trying to claim the martial artist wasnt a thing, the katana wasnt given to the berserker in EA, it was kept out of the class roster weapons because it was meant to be given to the marital artist, which is clearly visible here as the dragon button on this tripwire collectible  http://i.imgur.com/yGGn4d3.jpg?1  It was never 'Promised' and niether was anything else we got or didnt, tripwire didnt ever lay out a plan for EA buyers, but the martial artist was essentially a guarantee based on weapons, code, and products for sale. The Survivalist was added because 10 classes were 'Promised' and they didnt want to release more weapons with the last one, so they simply added a cobbled up class with nothing unique in terms of tools so they could release the game with all 'Promises' filled, this is essentially a scam and is a large part of why this review is negative. The 'SWAT' class was just as vaugely hinted and not 'Promised' in any way, and it made it in, its button is also visible in the link above, so the martial artist was just as guaranteed as the swat.)  -Only a year of support for this game is guaranteed by tripwire as of now, so no, dont buy it assuming it will be like killing floor one and be supported for years and years, if tripwire sees fit, this game will be dead in a year.  -Microtransactions in a 30 dollar game, that were introduced in EA.  - No way to jump into a private game with some friends short of buying a server or making sure you will fill any server you enter. Matchmaking or Solo are the only options for people who dont have a private server, this is a huge letdown from the first game where you could jump into almost any server with your friends and be guaranteed privacy. Playing with randoms in a game like this is hauntingly annoying.     UPDATE: I was totally wrong about this, i must have missed it in the patch notes, (Google searches still show this as a simply impossible option) You can indeed launch a private game with friends from the matchmaker now. While this does not change the review's recommendation, it certainly puts the game a grand many floors higher than i had tried to portray it, I apologize for giving false information. Thanks to 'Just Gertman' for pointing this out!   -Also, you can host a dedicated server on your machine and there are plenty of guides to help you do so if need be, its too complicated for my little brain but I'm sure with some work anyone with a powerful enough machine could manage it.   -Patriarch and other story elements (Such as the KF1 trader) are generally forgotten or ignored, very little nostalgia is paid to the first game. The Patriarch looks nothing like his old incarnation and generally isnt scary at all now, is a big, hulk looking, one line spewing, weenie.   -Game simply costs too damn much to have microtransactions and the content it has. Killing floor one is better than this game in every way but graphics and costs pennies in comparison. I paid 5 dollars for 4 costumes in KF1, i paid 5 dollars just to get fosters old outfit with gloves in this game.   Conclusion Killing floor 2 is not at all a bad game. In terms of graphics, its a massive leap over the first game, the gore system, is awesome and beautiful. But other than that, its just a watered down killing floor 1 (And keep in mind killing floor one goes on habitual sales for pennies), in addition to having microtransactions. If it goes on sale for 15-20 dollars, it will be worth it to most people, but in its current state, I feel like I paid too much for this game. Killing floor 1 didnt have the graphics this game had, but it had massive, complicated maps, a great amount of character, a terrifying final boss that you honestly jumped up and down when you actually beat it (Which was a rare occurence) and classes that all were useful and unique without encroaching on other classes.  In EA I saw so many mistakes made with this game, from the microtransactions to the banning of people in mass on the forums, but this review is for the full game and as such I wont bore you with that.   Is it fun? Yes, it is entirely a blast with friends. Is it better than killing floor 1? Only in graphics for me, others will disagree, and they aren't wrong, its a matter of opinion and what you need in a game. I could play a 2-D pixelated shooter and enjoy it more than next gen if it was simply better. Should you buy this game? Sure, if you think the content provided is worth 30 bucks and have a group of friends to play with, you will often come to this game and play a few rounds with your chaps, and you will probably really enjoy it.   I miss running through the Farms in killing floor 1, massive maps spanning kilometers, with my 2-3 friends, fighting off an actually SCARY AS ♥♥♥♥ patriarch, rather than the big cartoony muscle-mass that spews one liners that belong to a spiderman villian we have now. Everytime I try to get into this game, i just end up installing and playing Killing floor 1 again, thats not to say I dont enjoy this game when I play it, I simply like the first game more. That may change if they continue to work on it.   This review is right on the fence, I say no because right now I see killing floor 1 as the better game and its cheaper. That may change, and if it does, ill do my best to fairly change this review to compensate.",-1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2," EDIT (12/6/16):  My inventory has returned, but here we see Tripwire making basic game-affecting changes to the damage and health of bosses. I played for about an hour and multiple times I would find my health jumping from 70-80% to 0% without any reason as to why (Wasn't hit by patty's rocket, or anything that could explain why my health suddenly vanished) which made my experience quite frustrating. I wasn't the only one as all of my team members questioned what had just happened.  Clearly this game still belongs in early access as they're still rolling out 'Tweak' patches that modify the entire way the game is played. I'll be updating this review as more patches are released to see if they have any quality redeeming content.  ---   EDIT (11/21/16):  As of today my inventory is completely broken in KF2, none of my items are visible and I can't even view them through steam. Stunning. Also experiencing my levels being set to 0, then magically returning to normal minutes later.  ---   EDIT (11/18/2016):  I played the game for a few hours today and I've only noticed a few visual tweaks, moments into playing me and some friends have already noticed that the scoreboard glitches still exist, and the game even crashed.  Survivalist is a joke of a class that just reuses old content without providing anything new or genuine. It doesn't even get a class-specific knife like every other class. Disappointing.  ---  Since the game is being announced as 'Complete' on the 18th of this month, I figure it's about time that I post my thoughts on it now that I have almost 400 hours of playtime.  The gist of this review: It's a 6/10 clone of the previous game with crates, a perk system, 2 new classes, and one additional boss. It'd be a decent buy at $15-20 but not worth the $30 pricetag they're asking for it now that it's being announced as 'Complete'.  The gameplay is lacking a final grade of polish, the weapons aren't very much different from the first game and the mechanics are identical to the first game. When the game was first announced and the boss Hans Volter was introduced and Tripwire posted that it would be adding new never-before-seen classes it was speculated that we would be seeing a lot of new content that wasn't used in the previous killing floor, unfortunately this isn't the case with Killing Floor 2 as it refuses to produce a unique experience that doesn't feel like a clone of Killing Floor 1.  The game follows the same pattern as it's predecessor although with much less flair. Where the original Killing Floor maintained an amount of individualism, Killing Floor 2 feels like a cut and paste of the first game with overused FPS clichés such as microtransactions, crates, and weapon skins that are nothing but cosmetic. While there's nothing wrong with weapon skins or having a 'crate' system, it does feel as if Tripwire put most of their attention on cosmetics rather than actual gameplay.  The graphics and sound are amazing along with the new mechanics such as persistent blood which can turn a shiny room into a gore-fest (Buh dump tss), and the incredible weapon detail. Sadly this is where it pretty much takes a dive, while the game looks great it still lacks a feel of completeness that the original Killing Floor maintained throughout it's development. The game feels half finished and rushed in some areas, with the cutting of the Samurai (Ninja, whatever) class this is only more apparent that Tripwire simpily ran out of time and/or money to continue developing, and are now relying on their crate/microtransaction system to fund future developments of the game.  With only 4 days until launch, Tripwire is still having issues balancing the gameplay. This only adds to the theory that they spent too much time developing their secondary income methods instead of developing more gameplay mechanics. The hardest difficulty now plays like the easiest difficulty with zed spawns and damage being completely erratic and unpredictable regardless to difficulty. The game still suffers from frequents crashes and lag spikes even on the best of machines, which in this day and age is unacceptable for a release-ready game. This of course goes hand in hand with the fact that Tripwire to-date has only produced a handful of maps, now relying on third party devs to create levels via the workshop.  In my honest opinion this game is  NOT  ready for launch and should be kept in early access until it is in a more stable state. If you are interested in buying this game, I highly suggest waiting for a sale, or waiting until it has more content to offer. If you already own Killing Floor 1, you pretty much have already played Killing floor 2 as the gameplay is ALMOST IDENTICAL (with the exception of a few key mechanics, and of course the perk system).   TL;DR Wait for a sale. ",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Every single patch has made the game worse. Now they're balancing around the pvp mode no one wanted and recently added a damage resistance system that turns everything into a bullet sponge unless you happen to be carrying the correct weapon.  I wish I could get a refund.  Update for release: They fixed (removed) the bullet resistance ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but they failed to deliver on content promised in beta and have now decided it's just not happening. They still have microtransactions. Release update doesn't even have any major content, they just slapped a '1.0' label on the EA version.  I still wish I could get a refund.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"It's heartbreaking to wait  YEARS  for a new Killing Floor game only for it to be a pile of  trash .    Here are some reasons why.     Slow updates &amp; unwanted updates; PvP mode which is  heavily  unbalanced &amp; buggy. Sharpshooter update that just came out only a week ago after having to wait nearly a year and a half. Plus, there are some 'updates' that  only  add hats &amp; weapon skins! Great job Tripwire Interactive, you really know how to spoil us with content.     No content &amp; unwanted content; Microtransactions, a Player Vs. Player mode, and just the general lack of good content. We want more weapons not weapon skins. We want more maps more perks, we want the things you promised us!  Stop adding hats and weapon skins!      Censorship on the fourms daily; (At least from what I've been told.) Tripwire Interactive is banning anyone and everyone who dare say their opinion (I have yet to be ban, but! After writing this I  might  be!).     Tripwire Interactive ignoring fans; When Tripwire Interactive released Killing Floor 2 in Early Access they said in quote 'We'll be listening to the community &amp; the playbase to find out what  they , the community, wants added and what they want changed!' not a  single  community wanted feature has been added to the game, not a bloody single one... besides hats &amp; weapon skins!).     Difficulty; This is something that stood out when I was reading and watching about Killing Floor 2 dev blogs. Tripwire Interactive quoted that they were making the game more difficult and insane but from my hours of playtime I can safey say they dumbed it down and made it much easier.      Still in Early Access. The game is still in Early Access, shocking is it not? Tripwire Interactive told the community they'd have the game fully released within a year, by the way, happy first birthday Killing Floor 2 you're still not finished and you have  A LONG  way to go to compete with your older brother Killing Floor. (Still feels like it's in Early Access even though it's a fully released product.)   My heart is broken by how...  disgusting  this game is and how Tripwire Interactive is treating it's community &amp; fanbase. I love Killing Floor but not Killing Floor 2.  I have to give it a 4/10.  Updated rating. 3/10 for the 'finished' product.    Update 'Tactical Response'.    Eh update, a meh update in all seriousness I thought they'd make it a DLC and was shocked even it wasn't. I enjoyed the Tactical Response update, the new class is awfully fun to play. Yet Killing Floor 2 still has a few miles to go and isn't there just yet.    Update 'Full Release' (?)   You added two new classes, four or six new guns (couldn't be bothered to reinstall Killing Floor 2 just to uninstall it again) and like eight maps. Does Killing Floor 2 come anywhere close to Killing Floor, no. Is it a great FPS. eh. Does it live up to Killing Floor, not at all, not even in the slightest.  ",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Ok, so this is my first review I am willing to write for a game which I have waited for so long for. Undoubtedly, it instantly blew me away and fulfilled all my expectations.  I'm not a friend of Early Access Games or how the community likes to call them 'E.A.' titles.  This game is one of the few games I love to support even though it's only in Early Access. Once you are in the game, you will notice an inevitable few bugs and glitches, but despite this, overall the game is more bug and glitch free than other games which do not go into Early Access at all and get spammed with 'Day-one-Patches', so it is at least for some users playable.  Killing Floor was amazing ever since it began as a Mod for Unreal Tournament 2004. Then, the first actual Killing Floor game came out and I was absolutely blown away by it. Most Devs can't keep up to their first game in a Series but Tripwire Interactive managed to do so. They even stepped up in Quality of this brilliant, new game.  KF2 is amazing and worth every penny that I so gladly paid. I enjoyed every minute in this game and I am very excited looking forward to its full release with more Weapons, Characters, Perks, Maps and much more!  I can recommend this game to everyone who loves to kill Zombies and play as a  TEAM , and yes, I am writing the word 'team,' in uppercase letters, because in my opinion, without a good team, you won't enjoy it as much. You will wholeheartedly love this game if you follow the statements listed above.  Killing Floor 2 is already pretty bug and glitch free (as mentioned above) and I love that the Devs stayed with Unreal Engine 3 they got used to this version and did the best they could. Even more so, they forced the last drop of Graphic quality out of it and the result is of course, purely stunning.  All in all, if any of the below things listed are for you all I can say is buy this amazing game!    Zombies    Teamwork    Nice Graphics    Big Guns    Beautiful Designed Maps    Enhanced Gore    Character Selection and Customization    Enhanced Perk System    Fast and easy to understand Gameplay    Final Release. Still an amazing game.",1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Fun game, if a little bit repetitive. Shoot lots of zombies in slow motion, use a bazillion weapons and buy new ties and fedoras from the Steam market. Looks good, sounds good, plays good. It's everything I've ever wanted in a game.  Full video review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkOAWJxFic ",1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Now that Killing Floor 2 is FINALLY out, I can now finally say with absolute certainty, there are 5 things wrong with this game right off the bat.  1. Survivalist Class. What the hell is this? People could play how they wanted to before, are you shoehorning them into one class now? What can people do as their classes now? Are they not allowed to purchase any other weapon except their own class's designated weapon?  2. Another one of those games that is boring as hell to play alone and I can definitely say with all perks at 25, I hate this game solo.  3. The Versus mode is imbalanced and always will be. The ZEDs, no matter what you do to them, will always crush the other team because of the Bloats who can place mines everywhere, creating a camping problem and Gorefasts are force spawned on players way too frequently.   4. They replaced the datamined Martial Artist class for the Survivalist class. Why? The Berzerker could be based around attack speed and/or damage depending on your playstyle. Even using the parry ability to increase your attack speed or movement or what not. Don't make the Berzerker a tanky class like Martial Artist was meant to be. The Katana does not suit the Berzerker's style of play. It's very based on finesse and precision. Berzerker is not precise. End of.  5. Their communication with the fans/customers when they were doing this game was TERRIBLE. You expect them to actually fix stuff and/or listen to their customers to make the game better? No. What do they desire? Releasing the market on Early Access customers to see how much money they can milk on an idea that could have been stripped away in an instant, running away with the money. Do you desire to help a developer with risks like that? I wouldn't. I regret it too as I was thinking they were updating the gfx from KF1 and expanding on the idea, not... this...  4 things I like about the game.  1. It's fun being the Gunslinger, Berzerker, SWAT and Support classes. Dual wielding, meleeing up close, using the Kriss smg and shotgunning your way to victory is very satisfying.  2. Being a Scrake, Stalker, Husk and a Fleshpound is SO rewarding in versus. I would definitely recommend it.  3. Hate grinding? Want to experience the game at full potential? Go to perk training servers. You can soon see what the game is like without the long, strenuous grind on the same 3 maps that people play. It's like Counter Strike all over again with de_dust. It's not balanced or anything in terms of layout for versus, it's just because of people liking all the MLG garbage that comes from those maps. Why is this in the positive section? Well it's the positive. You can farm this annoying grind away, because let me tell you. The grind is irritable.  Do NOT get this game if you play a lot of games solo like me. They chose to release the market while it was still in early access. If you trust a shifty company like that that doesn't communicate with their customers properly, give this one a definite skip to tell them that you won't stand for shady practices.  DO NOT GET GAMES IN EARLY ACCESS! This is the first and last time I rely on a sequel of a good game to be just as good as the first. ALWAYS be paranoid everyone. Let them cater to YOU! You hold money. They don't, unless you give it to 'em. You have the power to make them better, you also have the power to make them worse.  Don't get this game.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Bought the deluxe back in 2015, got shafted out of the early access loyalty reward because after a while, I decided to wait until the game got released. If this is how they handle reward for people that supported and bought the game before it was done, then I pity the people that buy it now. Very glad that microtransactions were very clearly a priority. At least it showed what the real priority was. Money over the game. My only regret is that it's way too late to refund. Since it is too late, I will keep playing it so that my money wasn't a total waste.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,If your a fan of Nazi Zombies wave survival games &amp; Left 4 Dead games this is the game for you. I have played this game since it had been released.

Guns/Weapons,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"  Killing Floor 2 is (obviously) the continuation of the quite famous Killing Floor. Despite some minor controversy in early access it's finally entered full release. The only real way to play is online, as offline mode is mostly uninteresting and feels dull.  Everyone, especially the fans of the original, will be happy to know that the principle stayed the same. HOWEVER, almost everything has been improved. The classes (perks?... who thought of that) have been fleshed out better, new zeds look much better, there is a versus mode, everything feels smoother and weapon handling is even better. Everything is again accompanied by heavy metal, which goes alongside great and makes slaughter even more fun.  Every game basicly goes the same. You fight waves and waves of enemies, with some time to restock on ammo and buy new gear inbetween. In the end, your group faces one of two bosses with some interesing abilities, however nothing really out of the book. While you won't have much problem during easier difficulties, it gets much harder the higher you set it, making tactical play a must if you want to survive on suicidal and up.   There are 10 different classes and they all play differently. Surprisingly, all are viable and you are encouraged to have variety, as each class has different strenghts and weaknesses. Melee combat got improved immensely and the berserker class relies almost purely on it.   Zeds got a bit of an upgrade too. They are still almost harmless alone (minus some exceptions) but they can pose a threat to even the most experienced players in a group. You really have to work together, as running around alone quickly gets you killed.   And finally, versus mode. To be honest, I didn't really liked it, it kind of felt like a bad version of the same mode in Left4Dead 2. It's not really that well balanced (yet), but it's still fun to play, as constantly playing the same mode can get dull. That is also my worst gripe with the game, as you mostly do same things over and over again. There are no quests to keep things fresh, you basicly just kill everything untill the bell rings. I'm not saying that's bad, but it could be better. If weapon handling wouldn't be some damn great, I think people would get bored much faster.  Conclusion: Great continuation of Killing Floor, a lot of much needed improvements. Could get boring after a while, but if the moding scene keeps things fresh and the developers keep supporting the game for years to come, I think Killing Floor 2 has the potential to be a great game for years to come. It's definately my favourite co-op survival shooter at the moment - sorry Left4Dead 2, your reign has come to an end.  Final grade: 8.2/10",1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"This game has had its ups and downs for the whole devopement stage, it started out as a fun but repetitive zombie killer then needed polish, then the devopement team decided it would rather put micro transaction in game then polish it off, and so months went by with no change then some updates that smoothed the game out but still the game doesn't feel complete to me and so i can't reccomend anyone pay full price for this maybe if the devlopement team wasn't trash and cared a little bit more about the player base. I also decided to do this review after logging in a week ago to make sure i got access to their early access rewards and my account not getting them after messaging their support team back and forth i was told i was ♥♥♥♥ out of luck and never going to get them which was disapointing to say the least.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Well this game has been an interesting lesson to say the least. I bought this about a few months into early access, and I cannot recomend it. Pros: +Good weapon animation for view models. +Runs decently on my Nvidia GTX 960 (EDIT: My card has 4GB).  Cons: - Extremely poor balance with ZED mode. - The Launcher tends to crash the game before it fully loads (possibly a local issue). - Very poor value for the price, this factors in the time spent in Early Access and the timing of each update during that period. As well as content such as maps, classes, class skills, and progression to higher difficulties - Classes like the Martial Artist (previously datamined) are not present in the final version of the game, despite being advertised as such. - Blatant microtransactions and skinboxing, easily avoidable, but clearly this was where most of the devs focus went - Boss Characters like Hans, were never really balanced in early access. He alternated from being too difficult to too easy at many points. I don't believe a proper balance was ever found. Almost as if the devs gave up.  While I enjoyed the first Killing Floor quite a bit, it is clear to me that Early Access has not done this game any favors. And seeing it's changes throught the (excessivley lengthy) Early Access period never at any point gave any indication that this was a game that could surpass or be on par with the original. Killing Floor 2 is a microcosm of why Early Access is a generally bad idea. And I hope that it can serve as a guide for future developers as an example of what not to do.  Had I bought this game when Steam Refunds were an option, I would have refunded it two years ago.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Killing Floor 2 is a sequel to the popular and successful Killing Floor 1. Keep in mind that Killing Floor 2 is in early access and has yet to receive a full release. Many players from the previous title may know that some of the new features of Killing Floor 2 included sprinting and crosshair, which may come as a disappointment. While I personally do not believe this should be an issue at all for both veteran and new players, it does remove the aspect of having your knife out to run quicker.  About the  graphics  - there is no doubt that there is a big improvement. The game has updated graphics and textures which look significantly better than they did before.   There are 10  waves  and on the 11th wave you have to fight against a boss (either the Patriarch or Hans Volter for now). By the end of your tenth wave the map you’re surviving appears splattered in blood from each shot you make. It’s a good feature and definitely adds atmosphere to the chaos.   The first Killing Floor provided a selection of 7  perks . Killing Floor 2’s Early Access contains 9 perks for now - Berserker, Commando, Support, Field Medic, Demolitionist, Sharpshooter, Firebug, Gunslinger and the new perk Swat. Once the game reaches its full release it is rumoured that it will include 10 perks in total. Each perk has its own special skill which is unlocked at levels 5,10,15,20 and 25 and there are two options of which you can't choose your special skill.   The specimens  in Killing Floor 2 are a bit modified compared to Killing Floor 1. There are not many combos you can use for the insta - kill of the big zeds. I have seen one for the medic with his nades and I can't even call it a combo, more like a simple strategy and one for the firebug. So it is not very easy to kill Fleshpounds and Scrakes. The one thing I don't like is that if someone enrages the Scrake or the Fleshpound, they can attack anyone they want. So I find it really annoying to have them charging against me, without being prepared to kill them. Headshots here are essential, so try your best not to miss them.  I have a mixed feeling when it comes to  teamplay  . When the waves get harder in some of the cases everybody just runs around trying to save theirselves and it would be pure luck if you end the wave with your teammates being around you, because in some situations it is impossible to stay together. So it is best to count on yourself to finish the wave, alive.   There are not many  guns  added to this game, but hopefully new ones will be released soon.  More maps, weapons, game modes, removing classes imbalance, fixing teleporting zeds and concentrating on the game's development rather than adding cosmetics will definitely make more Killing Floor 2 players happy.   Overall I would not recommend this game to other people for now, because Tripwire have turned it into a casual game. You play 1-2 maps and everything is okay, but after that it gets deadly boring ... If I have to compare it with KF1 - a BIG lack of content. Sure it is an early access, but there aren't any signs of progress.  In the end after playing around 400 hours I came to the following conslusion: Killing Floor 2 - a game where disscussing other player's performance it is more important than the game itself. Enjoy.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Killing Floor 2 has a lot going for it. On the other hand, it has a lot more working against it.  It's obvious that Tripwire has no respect for the people playing their games. They have shown time and time again that they're more interested in padding their wallets at the expense of players than they are in creating a quality experience. From releasing an unfinished project like RO2 and letting it die on arrival, to taking a year longer than they said they would with KF2 while not including all the content they promised * , to the creme de la creme of wasting development time and money creating a microtransaction shop for an unfinished game.  Basically, you should avoid Tripwire and their games like the plague. Sure you might have a bit of 'fun' with Killing Floor 2, but I assure you there are thousands of good games on Steam alone. I'm sure you can find at least one you'll enjoy without having to support cancerous devs. Maybe look at Vermintide to scratch your Killing Floor itch.   *  They did add some 'unpromised' content like an awful versus mode that nobody wanted/wants. One can't help but wonder if the game would have been better had they not wasted time on that... doubt it.   ",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"This has the potential to be a great sequel, but it won't get another penny from me due to the ridiculous cash shop.  On the plus side, the cash shop is full of only comsmetics (for now.) The downside is buying a key to unlock random garbage costs nearly as much as a full skin pack from killing floor 1.   A skin pack from killing floor consisted of multiple overhauls of characters except for the voice; not just a little hat. I purchased killing floor 1 skins because unlike killing floor, I knew what I was buying and I didn't have to gamble to get it.  The devs jumped on the gambling bandwagon to grab ahold of those who can't resist, but to continue forking out dollar after dollar until they get a 'rare.'  There are some good things about these updates, but that's just not relevant compared to this issue. Selling cosmetic packs would have earned this a positive review, but this system was created to ♥♥♥♥ with the gambling addicts and for that I just can't respect the development choices of this game. They would have earned a lot more money from me had they given me the option to buy skins, but I don't gamble.",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"The original Killing Floor was the epitome of a simple concept well executed. You and up to five teammates shot a variety of mutants who arrived in waves, which earned you money to spend on better weapons between the waves. That was it. That was the entire game. However, it got the basics of great gameplay mechanics, great map design, and a meaningful set of difficulty options that tied in with the progression system so very right, that it remained compelling. Everything I just wrote could be applied to the sequel as well, but with all of the standards brought up to a modern level, with the possible exception of map design.

232090,Killing Floor 2," November 18th 2016 update.  This review is now one year old and has been written when the game had only two characters and two playable maps, half of the perks were missing and balance was non-existent. That’s all apart from the Trading Floor controversy. Since then Killing Floor 2 has indeed improved a lot. There’s now much more variety to the process of smashing zeds, a decent selection of gorgeous maps, and full collection of perks and abilities to choose from. The microtx are also less annoying.  The game, however, is still wildly unbalanced for two people (less so for 3+ teams) which prevents complete co-op satisfaction as final boss is virtually impossible to take down in 2v1 scenario unless both players are highly leveled. Some perks still need adjustments to bring them on par with each other.  The review stays negative as a reminder of atrocious practice of introducing microtx during EA and failure to finish and release the product in due time (it’s been a year off already). Such practices are unacceptable. Also this crates'n'keys gambling garbage must die. In KF2, in TF2, everywhere.   November 27th 2015 update.  Tripwire has actually  provided some feedback  [www.kotaku.co.uk]  on their controversial decision where they confirmed that all future “free” content is going to be sponsored by revenues generated from microtx.  That means all promised perks, bossess and expected new maps are not going to be finished and released until enough money is sucked from community (above what has already been paid).  That means Tripwire lied when they said the game would be done in 2015. It’s not going to be done. By “done” they wanted to say that just enough features would be implemented to support “Trading Floor” [sic], not the core content that was expected.  John Gibson also insisted on how good in-game economies are (!) and expressed his wishes about how community would create content for themselves (apparently the content that Tripwire was supposed to deliver) and then vote on what would appear in-game so that they can happily dump their money in it for so much “value and joy”.  At this point anyone who defends their act is simply autistic.  And I don’t think this is going away: it isn’t. Just as there were enough hat-buyers, crate-openers and safe-drillers, so there would be enough addicts who would embrace new  Killing  Trading Floor, there would be pathetic idiots who would defend such schemes because they apparently are counting Tripwire’s money better than their own and know it first-hand, that poor developer is out of dosh and only another money-grabbing scheme is going to help it (and anyone who objects is a “crybaby”), etc, etc. That’s alright: it is something that is expected from infantile, autistic idiots. Well, you got what you wanted, I guess? See you in game (if I ever install it again), after  you  spend enough of  your  money in “zedconomy” and at least all perks and maps would be released (if).

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Killing Floor didn't have microtransactions, why do they think kf2 needs them? First one is still amazing WITHOUT stupid crates and keys. Tripwire needs to get its head out of its ♥♥♥ and listen to the community and not the assinine shareholders",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"This game already wasn't as good as KF1 which I played the crap out of but I was willing to give it the benifit of the doubt because all of the content was not in the game yet. BUT now microtransactions announced before even getting the initial content all in the game? I paid for a full game and this is not a full game yet... but you will charge me for items in microtransactions?  Bah! The overkill business model. I hope this hits you where it hurts tripwire... in the wallet. I thought you were better than this.  *UPDATE SINCE RELEASE* I was really upset with TW for a lot of reasons during the early access process, particularly with the microtransactions. On release.. it is ok. Still no KF1 but there is hope shown that they will get there over the years as they did with KF1.  Recommending this as a buy in probably in the long run. Worth it now I think but probably not for everyone.  A few detailed notes: - The new level asthetics are quite nice but I miss a lot of the old maps. New maps seem smaller and less open. This should all be resolved down the road when custom maps become a normal thing. - Weapons I find largely dissapointing in this game. Hopefully that will improve. - Bosses are hard. Much harder than first game. That can be good or bad depending on howyou look at it. - Zerker is different than KF1. I loved KF1 zerker... others hated it. People love KF2 zerker... I can't get into it. - The microtransactions aren't bad. It actually gives you a chance at cosmetic rewards straight up at no cost. I am tired of getting crates and USBs I will never open though. - No listen servers so if you want to play private with friends all of the time like I do, you will want to set up your own server. - Public players I have played with are pretty nice for the most part but I have also seen many hackers and cheaters.",-1,1

Basic gist:  - Said that Tripwire originally stated at earliest 6 months after EA which would have been around October 2015 for release. Final release date was November 2016  - PvP is official and worked out great didn't it?  - Ruffled a few soft feathers",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"I'll keep this as unbiased as possible.  Killing Floor 2 is the successful sequel to Killing Floor 1. The ZEDs are much scarier then their KF1 counter parts (and the Clot now has a sick as ♥♥♥♥ swag walk), the guns feel powerful and do some real damage thanks to the new M.E.A.T. system which allows you dig into the brains of a Fleshpounds with an AK12 and the characters all have unique voices now which, personally from my perspective, is a great thing because it opens up much wider varieties of humour then just 'WAAAANKARS!'.  However, development for the game is slow and while Tripwire are doing their best to make the perks feel strong and balanced while also preventing Fleshpounds from being nearly undestroyable there is one very obvious and glaring flaw for now.   Microtransactions in an unfinished game   Now I dunno why this even got past the suggestion phase, the game isn't complete, there are unfinished balancing issues to be addressed, gunslinger is still to be added to the game and work on Sharpshooter (which I'm interested in due to the fast paced nature of Killing Floor 2) is almost non-existant. Not only are we missing one of our core vanilla perks from Killing Floor 1 but the game is nowhere near finished in terms of balancing and perk weapons.  Now, this wouldn't be an issue if the game was finished and these items were offered in a DLC pack, these items are simply cosmetic and weapon skins that do not affect gameplay in any form but the reason this is such a bad thing is because it's preventing production and work  on things that need to be addressed in the game right now!   I listed this as negative purely because of how strong an impact microtransactions have on the gaming industry right now, microtransactions should  NOT  be a part of any game that you pay full price for, it's a gimmick for free-to-play games. Not paid products like Killing Floor 2 which is actually  far from finished.   I would love to make this a positive review and I had planned on writing a positive review for Killing Floor 2 but the fact they are also attempting to censor any form of backlash about their decision on the Tripwire Interactive forums has changed my mind. I will not say don't buy this game but I will say this with a heavy heart.   Buy with caution. ",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"After several failed promises and a delay of nearly a year, KF2 is finally out of Early Access. I can't recommend this game in its current state, especially when several features that the developers promised in the final release are still not in the game.   Tripwire projected this game would leave EA by the end of 2015. That was false, but it's understandable that they'd probably have to push their release date back. It hard to fault them here. Delays happen.  Tripwire also promised 3 bosses by the time the game released. That's The Patriarch, Hans, and the new boss 'The Matriarch'.  There was to be enhanced enemy AI on harder difficulties, such as Crawlers being able to crawl on walls. The devs have admitted they've worked on this, but that it's still bugged. They've had a year and a half to work on this game.  The 10th perk was going to be the Martial Artist (hence the Katana) but it was axed in favor of The Survivalist. This is quite possibly the biggest cop-out in the entire development of this game, considering that Survivalist is a creatively bankrupt perk that required no extra weapons to be created and just focused on off-perking. Off-perk weapons are fun, but they don't need an entire perk surrounding them. The perk has been coldy received by the playerbase.  Now real quick let's talk about the things they did add in that nobody asked for:  The resistance system. To their credit they've dialed back this system, but for awhile Crawlers could take AA12 shots to the face like it was nothing. The team thought it was a good idea to give Crawlers this huge resistance to Shotguns and Fire Weapons(I'd like to point out that Firebug's XP Objective is to kill crawlers with Fire weapons). Their philosophy was that you should constantly be changing perks to deal with the situation at the time. How moronic.  Versus mode. A mode nobody asked for and nobody wanted. Go ahead and check the servers and you'll see plenty more people want to play Survival over Versus. This isn't Left 4 Dead. Killing Floor was built on the foundation of co-op, and a Versus mode goes against the very groundwork of the game. Who are they catering to in this instance? L4D2 is still quite popular and is the preferred game for PvP gameplay.  Crates and the shared content system. I'll tell you right off the bat that crates don't affect gameplay. They don't. What I will point out is how scummy it is to implement this system before the full release. Wouldn't it make more sense to build crates around a complete game? 'No, because how else could we sell more keys when all the classes come out?'. It doesn't hurt the gameplay, but it really shows where their priorities lie in that they would rather reskin the same guns over and over before making a new weapon for an existing perk. Shared content only affects one weapon right now, the zweihander, and can only be accessed if you or someone in your server owns the game Chivalry. Any way you slice it, this is a paywall, a barrier of entry. You can be completely denied a weapon if no one in the server owns that game, and I don't think that's right. Granted, it's a step above Killing Floor 1's paid weapons, but it's still wrong.  And they keep nerfing the Firebug what the ♥♥♥♥?  tl;dr I don't recommend this game right now. They failed to meet so many of their promises, and their development choices have been very poor. So until they get their act together, I'm getting my refund.",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"  Welcome to 'Whose Kill is it Anyway?'  The game where everyone's thirsty for kills and your teammates don't matter..  Still a great game though :D  If you've capped every class, might I suggest joining servers that hosts 20+ playes on HoE 👍",1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Well, where do I start? This game is in no ways a bad game, but, I have to say that some of the decisions taken by Tripwire were kinda off-putting.  I've been following the development of this game since before the ZedConomy update, and I can see why some the early adopters are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Tripwire.   Microtransactions   To be honest, I don't really mind these MT's, since they are merely cosmetical, but I think they should have announced the inclusion of them at least 1 month earlier to prevent the huge backlash that it caused.   Slow updates   Now, the updates themselves were painfully slow, especially if we take in account that this game was originally planned to be out in 2015.    Stay tuned!      PVP   The PVP mode was really bad at the time of release, and I personally think that it was a mistake, and that the time and resources that TWI spent on creating it should have been used on adding content for the core game mode, like new weapons.   The 10th Perk   The Survivalist perk is underwhelming to say the least and, in my personal opinion, goes against the idea of having a Perk based gameplay. It's basically a Jack-of-All Trades which does a mediocre job at everything. Also, it doesn't even have weapons of it's own, it just uses weapons from the other 'real' Perks.  Now, let's talk about the good things! -It's a gorgeous looking game -Well optimised, even a toaster can run it -Fun gameplay   Just stay away from PVP mode    All that said I'd reccomend this game to anyone who just wants to shoot some ugly ZEDs in the face.

In early access before any of the actual gameplay content is anywhere near finished? Paid full character skins while already having the random box system? Obviously, there are also going to be paid weapon packs with 'sidegrades'. I seem to remember one of the devs saying 'we want to show early access done right' and 'this is not going to be a cashgrab'.  Short devblog posts about upcoming perks and maps that are barely a couple of paragraphs long with a couple of .GIF teasers while the 'Trading Floor' gets a full graphical 3-page spread of info. Neat.  'But it doesn't affect the gameplay! It's just skins!' - Great. I mean, if it did, there would be a real ♥♥♥♥♥torm (already happened recently to a certain other co-op shooter).

232090,Killing Floor 2,"This will be pretty much a summary for people who came from KF1 and are still unsure of whether or not they should buy the game.  Pros:   +The most noticeable mechanics in-game are probably the ability to sprint and bash. They sound like a deal-breaker when you imagine KF1, however the implementation feels adequate to the game. Especially since Zeds no longer have 1 or 2 sets of animations. Now the zeds are alot more livid. They roll, they dodge, they cover their bodies when being shot, they suicide when low on health to try and take you with them (I'm looking at you Mr. Husk), they have a larger variety of moves and attacks that will surely present a challenge to most people that are not used to it.  +The graphics have improved tremendously, each character has their own set of voice lines and you are able to customize them to your liking (provided you have the cosmetics to do so, even then, the default ones are pretty decent).  +The weapons are very detailed and feel very satisfying to use. You can tell, that even in slow motion, most weapons handle as if they were real, such as the barrel shaking while firing. At the point of this review, the weapon roster is a bit empty, however, as time progresses, more weapons will be added into the game, just like in KF1. Pressing the Reload button while the weapon is fully loaded will play a inspect animation specific to each weapon, showing off the details like checking if your magazine is full or cocking it to make sure the round is in the chamber. Very addictive to do that.  +There are more classes/perks to pick from. All of the classics are there are a few newer ones such as GunSlinger and SWAT that are also very fun to play. There is also a new perk, the Survivalist, that pretty much focuses on off-perk weapon combinations without the penalties of them being off-perk. You basically become a jack of all trades master of nothing. There are 25 levels instead of the classic 6, and every 5 levels your perk gains one of two possible skills that you can choose to use during a wave/game. Each skill is created to suit one's playstyle so it's up to the players to find the best combination for their style of playing whilst using the perk.  +All the zeds have returned (including a new boss and a few more clot variants that each act differently). They bring more animations and extra attacks that will surely spice up your gaming sessions. The Zeds have different behavior depending on each difficulty (example, the Husk now fires a flamethrower at close range on Suicidal+ and clots gain extra attack movements, among others). New zed variants have been included, such as the albino clot (which explodes and leaves a gas cloud unless you headshot it) and an albino alpha clot which enrages all nearby zeds, buffing them up on damage and resistance. Zeds also can now get stunned or panic  +The OST used in-game is pretty good, still very appropriate to the game, just like the predecessor.  +Most maps are decent, creating a nice atmosphere for the players stuck in an Zedpocalypse. The lights are dynamic, which means that a bad placed shot or explosion can cause a previously well lit room into near pitch black darkness, which adds to the difficulty and fun of the game.  Cons:  -Zeds (at the time of this review) teleport to places when you're not looking, it's all part of the devs attempt to keep the player under stress during the entire round. Although I think the idea is pretty good, it is badly implemented. It leads to moments where you have 3 sirens behind you and as you turn the corner, there they are right in front of you, pretty much ending your life in less than 3 seconds.  -The character's voice commands and quotes are very bland and not inspiring at all. It feels like they are being written by kids. No offense TW, I find your game great but can you really step up your writer's game? The voice lines from the original KF were so much funnier and alot more cleaver than they are now. 'I've seen scarier, and you're not it!' ...Really? Is that how you insult a monster that's trying to eat your flesh?  -The voice line wheel. I think the Devs are going to change this, but as of right now, it's a wheel that was made to used by a controler. Instead of a command where you press from '1-10' you have to hold the button and slide the mouse to the command you want to issue. Yeah have fun doing that on an FPS with a mouse while being chased by 5 zeds while taking damage...  Neutral:  ~The game features something called the Zedconomy. A system that you might be familiar with if you play games like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The game basically features weapon skins and character cosmetics which allow you to add extra costumization to either your prefered character or weapon. Just like the games I have mentioned, you need to pay for them if you wish to obtain them. That or simply cross your fingers you'll get them on a random drop. My personal opinion of it is that I don't mind them. Skins/cosmetics are... like the name implies, purely aesthetic and do not alter your gameplay in any way what so ever. If you want them, you can get them. If you don't want them, you'll still get them... But hey, at least you can sell/trade them for something more suitable to your tastes.  Conclusion:  Even with all little issues/lack of content that this game has, do keep in mind.. The dev team is small and they are already working on another title at the same time: Rising Storm 2. The game right now is already pretty great, but just like the first one, the devs will continue to work on it after launch, fixing bugs, making some slight changes and adding extra maps, weapons, characters and holiday events.   I give this game a solid 7.5/10. After enough time has passed and content added, I'll probably rise the score to a 8.5 or even 9.  TL;DR - Buy this game, it's cheap, it's fun and it's totally worth it.   ",1,0

232090,Killing Floor 2,"So, what can I say about Killing Floor 2? I´ve bought this game without having looked at any video or forum thread nor have I played the previous game KF1. The decision was just based on my fascination with zombies in general. I tried out games like No More Room in Hell, Left for dead, Read Dead Redemption: Undead nightmare and the Call of Duty zombie stuff...so after considering that there are so many games of that genre out there, is Killing Floor 2 worth buying? My answer is a confident yes, if your pc manages to run the game on a high graphical level everything is very appealing and enjoyable. The detailed maps are just awesome and there´s  not even one!  I don´t like. Im also a huge fan of the different perks (classes) because there´s literally everything you might want to try out. You wanna slash zeds like warninja? No problem! Give the berserker a go!  You like doing some aim practice head shot action? Play gunslinger,the McCree of KF. I think you got what I mean by now.. A last point before I end this is to give u an impression of the community. In my opinion KF2 has definitely one of the better communities out there, if you are used to CSGO or Moba games you will be suprised how friendly online gamers can be ;)",1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Refunded as soon as it got out of EA. Tripwire went the wrong way, the 'I want to be like CS:GO' way, and ended up with..this.   It is fun, at first. Then you play the same maps, again, and again, and again. Then you change difficulty, same thing, same maps, but now the zeds heads are bullet sponges.   Lack of content would be the main reason I stopped playing this. Of course, it's EA, it is a phase where they work on that but, they didn't. Intstead they:    Added microtransactions. Skins, specifically. Ugly skins, moslty, more specifically. +2 euros to open one crate, to get battle scarred skins.    Added a PvP mode we didn't need, nor ask for. Which none of my KF friends really play, and they play this game a lot.    Out of nowhere, they decided to develop a console version, in case the content development wasn't slow enough already.   So instead of getting us the story mode, or the martial artist perk, or some other things we asked or they promised, they got us that ♥♥♥♥.   Don't get me wrong, I am not against having cool skins, but they could bring good looking skins, or even animated skins, like H1Z1 did, but not when you are supposed to improve the core gameplay and bring more stuff to play with.   Yes, there are good things in it, no fps drops, mostly stable builds, original and well made weapon models..but if they had invested all the time they spent making that crappy PvP mode or the skins in improving the core foookin gameplay..this game would be completely different.  Just get KF1 instead during a sale and enjoy all those maps and dlc content cause this is just a good looking KF1 wannabe. At least these skins are not as ugly as in Payday 2, guess thats a pro.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"If I would have written this review a few months ago chances are I would have left a 'No' to the 'Do you recommend this game?' question. The journey through Early Access have been like a rollercoaster for Killing Floor 2, plenty of up's and down's. Personally, I've enjoyed this game from the day it launched on Early Access and I still do today. However, I feel like I wouldn't do some of the fans of the game justice if I didn't mention some of the more common complaints Killing Floor 2 has gone through.  The updates for Killing Floor 2 has been on the slower side, and there hasn't been a ton of content added in those slow(ish) updates if you compare them to the bigger updates you see in other games such as Terraria. (In no way is Terraria similar to Killing Floor, I'm just making an exampel even if my choice may be poorly). However, as a wise person once said 'quality over quantity', and quality is what Tripwire have delivered in every update, usually a map or two aswell as a new perk with a few new weapons.   Another thing that some have complained about is how they've added three community made maps in the last couple of updates (which in my opinion were really good and well made) instead of official ones, which may seem a bit lazy. Luckily our prayers have been heard and we've been blessed with the brand new map 'ZED Landing' which is already a favorite of mine, and for the first time introduces a more dynamic experience as the map changes over the course of the game similar to Battlefield's 'Levolution' which was a huge and very welcoming suprise that I truly hope will be a feature in the (hopefully) future maps of Killing Floor 2 aswell as the maps in their upcoming game 'Rising Storm 2: Vietnam'.  Besides those complaints there has been some buzz around Tripwire aswell, like an developer claiming something like 'the players are too demanding' when faced with negative reviews due to the slow updates I mentioned earlier. In my opinion I agree with him, game development (especially for such a well made game like Killing Floor) is a lengthy and not easy process. However, it may be a bit unprofessional to leave such a statement. (I can't remember the whole story surrounding that so I'd like to apologize in advance if some of the information I gave out may be false, feel free to correct me on that if so). But the grand prize for the hate storm came when Tripwire announced a new Killing Floor game by the name 'Killing Floor: Incursion' which is a VR exclusive title, problem being Killing Floor 2 was still in Early Access and people were upset as it appears Tripwire wanted a quick cash-grab making new games for the franchise when they haven't finished the second one, which they now have, so the mistake Tripwire did was announcing Incursion way too early to join in on the VR hype as it was announced around the time when the VR hype was new and exciting instead of waiting to announce it after Killing Floor 2 left Early Access.  Now that I'm done with my endless rant about some of the more general complaints against the game let's jump to the fun part, the good parts that is.  There are now 10 maps in the game made by Tripwire. (13 if you count the community made ones) and they are so well designed that I just want to send a basket of mini-muffins to Tripwires office. They all have different styles so it never feels like any maps are similar, and they all call for different experiences and playstyles. The visuals and details are simply amazing, in-fact, may be the most well-designed maps for a multiplayer shooter I've ever seen. The lightning, the formations, the little things that makes the maps more dynamic like snowstorms, dirt falling off ceilings, the waves carrying boxes and debris, the trees swaying, the fires/explosions and the list goes on, all makes for a bloody (literally) good time.   The animations are top-notch, and there's plenty of them. Almost every weapon has it's own set of animations, reloading, hitting, cutting, shoving, blocking, playing around with, aiming, you name it. There are atleast 3 different animations for melee attacks, and even more animations for melee weapons like wiping off blood from it, spinning them around, hitting your shield with your club, and much more. Not only the weapons but the doors, wind turbines and of course, the ZED's (Killing Floors own name for zombies or mutants). They're all very smooth and sharp making the flow of everygame flawless, mix that with the great level design and you have a game that will give your hours upon hours of fun.  The gore system is also a huge improvment from Killing Floor 1, a feature Killing Floor truly deserves. Just running around the map at the last wave seeing all the body parts, blood-stained walls and floors really does add to the chaos this game offers.  If you ask me, Killing Floor 1 &amp; 2 is a prime exampel of why I'm proud of being a PC gamer, and two titles I think everyone should pick up and play, simply a must buy! (And yes I know Killing Floor 2 is on consoles aswell). So what are you waiting for? go pick it up, kill some zeds as they say!",1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Now that it is finally out of early access I will make a review :). This is a fun game. It can be frustrating at times but overall it is enjoyable. Just as in the first game you will die a lot. Don't get discouraged and keep playing. If you can't take the dying at first than this might not be for you. While Killing Floor 1 is a lot more difficult IMO, KF2 still gets fairly difficult in the harder difficulties. Runs fairly smooth for me on an nvidia 760. If you need to tone down the graphics, it still looks pretty decent. There are the dreaded microtransactions, but they are all cosmetic and there is no pay to win. You don't need to buy anything if you don't want to. Team play is the highlight of this game, all the classes except one have a specialty, perks to mix and match, and a role to fill on the team. Solo play is very winnable if you're one who likes to play by themselves. There is a neat metal soundtrack to go with the game. I would've preferred some thrash metal or more from the band that the original KF featured but it does a good job and it's got some catchy riffs, not a fan of the vocals, but th e riffs are good. The maps are also usually really awesome.   My only real gripes about the game as of right now is the survivalist perk is fairly useless and the buttons and perks get switched back to default every update.  I recommend this game! It is fun and they will add more to it! Including holiday updates which are always fun. I miss my Gingerfasts. Don't eat me! 9/10",1,1

All this while they're throwing advertisements for the game out on Hulu, Youtube, and some TV channels. And still calling themselves an 'Indie developer' and pretending that the big mean gamers are picking on them.  This game is a prime example of the cancer that is killing the gaming industry.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"1st Review: It pains me to say it, but because of recent events, I can no longer whole heartedly recommend this game now or (Seemingly) anytime in the future. Killing Floor 2 has potential even though since it's inception, has deviated from the path of Killing Floor 1. I had my suspicions of bad things to come since the 2nd Dev Diary, and those suspicions ended up being true.  Tripwire Interactive never stated that the use of Microtransactions would be part of the core mechanic of the game, and had never pitchd the idea to the community. I would rather have DLC skin packs after the full release of the game. The use of the 'CS:GO' strategy is unfavorable, regardless of whether or not the items affect the gameplay. It's nothing more than an attempt to create an in-game economy that encourages heavy spending on the 'Possibility' of getting an item you want.  I am excited about all the other content, I've been looking forwards to it for a long while now. I'm likely to be playing after the patch in order to gauge a proper opinion on the new perks and weapons. Although I'll be playing to form an opinion, I will not change my mind over the Microtransaction implimentation.  (This review is likely to change depending on the state of the game per meaningful update or upon full release. An 'Edit' or 'Review #' moniker will be added to allow a re-read of the previous review vs. the most recent.)  2nd Review: I'm doing this for a badge.  TWI is planning on fixing firebug and survivalist. Game is done and shipped, still have that dumb MT thing going.  Rate it 7/10, low levels are dumb and keep joining HoE or Suicidal.

The experience the game offers is well-polished and very enjoyable for any gun fanatic (the attention to detail is amongst the best FPS out there regarding the gun-play). Although repetitive by nature, the gameplay itself is very addictive.   However, this game still has so much potential - at times it feels like the developers have only scratched the surface of what is to come. Here's hoping for the best of futures for Killing Floor 2.   Would I recommend this game... absolutely! Does one need to do some research regarding said title before purchasing and see if said title might be something they would enjoy... absolutely!

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Tripwire created a game that many different people can play. A game where you can come into it at varying skill levels, understand the basics and get good at said basics without carrying the burden of being a new player which often is the case with other hardcore shooters. In a game like KF1, if you're new you're a burden that's it plain and simple. So what we have in Killing Floor 2 is a game designed to induct MORE players. Variety in this game consists of the number of different guns, there is no variety in how you USE them to kill something. You just shoot bullet sponges. There is nothing to master in the long run, the skill ceiling is low and you can't tell the difference between the average player and a veteran. Also, everyone plays commando, go figure.   Regardless, I recommend it   steam has no ♥♥♥♥ing in between option still ffs   because its accessible to anyone looking to get into an FPS. The game on its own is fun for a while. It's one of those games were you don't need to be good to enjoy it. But if you're one of those KF1 hardcore players looking for a proper sequel, it's not this and never will be. Based on what I said it's up to you anyway if you want to dump your money on a video game.   Decent game, not a 'Killing Floor' game.    Merry Christmas you filthy casuals.  ",1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Game introduces microtransactions that are PAID before completing the core content necessary to exit early access and launch.  The team also took 7 months to add 2 perks / classes and 3 new maps.  Basically, with the added paid microtransactions while still in EAccess, this game is now pure cancer.  UPDATE:  They cant stop ♥♥♥♥ing up, they just replaced the last perk that was supposed to be martial arts / scientist with a extremly boring perk that just uses other existing perks without new weapons.The game got released today and Im really really dissapointed, i played alot of Kf1 and i have been around since launch of early access and the game just doesnt live up to Kf1 and im usually the person that hates the people crying about how much better the first game was and dont even give the sequel a chance,i did give KF2 a chance, a big one and i invested alot of time but Tripwire changed like Overkill did and many other companies and this game is just not worth more than 10 euros at max. if you loved Kf1 and dont know if you should get kf2 or not, please dont.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Update 3: Was finally able to put in a refund request to wash my hands of this mess. They are still heavily censoring their forums to this day, and the last 'class' they released was a complete joke just so they could say they released the 10 they originally promised. Never again will I spend my money on early access.  Update 2: According to the recent live stream, they only guarantee support until the end of next year unless they make more money. There's so much wrong with this I don't even know where to start. It just blows my mind that they have a date like that when the game isn't even out of Early Access yet.  Update: TWI is now lying not only about unbanning everyone(not even close)but also about how many were banned in the first place while trying to pass the buck to steam global moderators. Integrity obviously means nothing to these people.  The moderation on the steam forums is out of control. People are getting warnings and bans left and right for almost no reason at all just because they aren't praising the game. It's like Overkill 2.0. Threads concerned with the direction of the game are constantly disappearing. Yoshiro is actually stalking people by following them to other websites, and using conduct there as grounds to ban them on Steam. What the hell?  Early Access is no excuse for treating your paying customers like garbage.  This is all on top of a gambling crate system introduced more than 7 months after the initial release of the game, having ridiculously slow development, losing staff, major balance problems, screwing up the development cycle even more by adding a PvP mode that nobody asked for just so they could push their stupid MT skins, adding a 'game conductor' which nobody asked for, the 'flex' feature they were so proud of that still isn't working properly...so much for planning to release last year. At the rate they are going the game will be obsolete by the time it's finished.  Edited for spelling/grammar",-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Pros: The gameplay is very solid, and has a robust feel to it with having the melee combat and gun feedback feeling impactful whenever you land a hit or a headshot.  The graphics and gore are a very extreme step up from Killing Floor 1 as you can little cover an entire map with blood. There are a handful of maps that go along with a handful of weapons and perks. Systems such as dynamic movement from Zeds and Zed Damage Blocking at higher level difficulties makes the game interesting rather than just plainly adding more health/damage. Is a blast to play with friends or a well coordinated group of people.  Cons: Literally, there are only a handful of maps with a handful of weapons and perks. It gets very repetitive very quickly if the core gunplay can't keep you satisfied. Playing with an uncoordinated team is worse than playing League of Legends. They added microtransactions to the game in EA with the content not being plentiful. Most of their EA promises were unfulfilled, such as having a lot of bosses and the Martial Artist. Newest content pack (Survivalist) completely breaks the point of the class system. One of the slowest content updating schedules I've seen since Cube World.  Honestly speaking, I love the game. I've played 500+ hours on it from the DAY IT CAME OUT. It was very fun at the time, and I loved how intense the higher level difficulties were. However, the game lost its luster for me as I kept playing it over and over with my friends.  The content came out at a snail's pace, but they had the guts to add a microtransaction system to the game when they had little to no content. As someone who bought about 10$ worth of microtransctions, I can say that it was a completely stupid decision as I couldn't keep myself playing to actually enjoy the skins.  Buying the original Killing Floor 1 would be a better decision than buying Killing Floor 2 as it is currently.",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"(Killing Floor 2)  I've been playing this game since the very first day it was released on early access. Back then it was very bare bones and only had 4 classes in the game. I have had the chance of seeing it grow and change drastically over the years, finally culminating into the complete game we have now. I believe that game is worth buying.  This is a very enjoyable co-operative first person shooter. You and 5 other people try to survive against increasingly challenging waves of ''zeds''; cloned monstrosities set loose upon the world by the Horzine Corporation. The soundtrack is death metal and it's bloody as hell. It's a very cathartic experience.   There is an extremely large and varied arsenal of weapons to choose from split between 10 classes. The developpers, Tripwire, used to be infamous for their long development times and lack of communication with the community but they've definitely addressed that problem recently. Updates are frequent and fast, and they always release new images and previews to let people know what they're working on. Even though the game left early access, it's still going to be constantly upgraded.   The 10 perks can all be leveled up to level 25, which can take a bit. Furthermore, there are several difficulty levels that drastically alter the gameplay ( they change the zed behavior, making them more deadly) as well as custom maps. All of those things add tons of replay value to the game.   Evan tho i have 100% complete on killing floor 2 i keep comming back to it just for the sheer fun that it brings. Don't know what else there is to say about Killing Floor 2. It's quite a simple game with a good amount of content, replay value and fun.   You should get it if you want 100% co-op fun :D  ",1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"You kill stuff, get dosh, Buy weapons with that dosh, Kill more stuff and get bigger weapons, Repeat until boss wave, Kill Boss then throw dosh at boss.   Pros:  - Every class is fun in it's own unique way.  - Graphics are fantastic, including the gore.  - Weapons including Melee are top notch.  - Weither you're a complete Noob or a Pro at the game. You're able to select different diffuclties which also change the Zeds behaviour which include Animations, Attacks, Movement etc.  Cons:  - Developers tend to lose focus on what the main objective is and that apperently isn't finshing the game. (Adding in a PVP system, Mircotransactions and creating another game.)  - Classes could use more weapons as every class only has a selection of 4 Weapons. Would be nice to see 2 extra weapons for each class and Off-Perk weapons.  - Players need to be able to get more use out of a door.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"What the hell happened, Tripwire?  As a long time KF1 player, this game was so promising in the beginning, the gameplay was solid, the combat was hectic and satisfying, the guns were nothing short of amazing (Did they ever fix reloading both guns after firing a single shot with akimbo pistols? Literally the only complaint I can come up with). The graphics were equally impressive. And then it all fell apart.  Updates were slow. Fine, game development isn't an easy task, and is time-consuming to say the least, particularly when you're aiming to release a product at its best.  Then the microtransactions came. A system intended to maximize profit for literally zero effort beyond the initial implementation, and extremely minimal effort should they decide to actually add new 'content' to the system. For one thing, the timing couldn't have been worse with another well-known game screwing over their players by doing the exact same thing weeks prior. They still haven't fully recovered from that, and probably never will even with all of their damage control and making their crates free to open (though I'm fairly certain the trader crowd has happily moved in to replace the players they lost - ensuring the already terrible community will never recover).  I'll admit I was intrigued by the concept, but felt it would be out of place and would waste time and money to implement it... I am of course talking about the PvP mode. PvP was a mode that 'everybody' apparently wanted. I have no idea who 'everybody' is as I have not met or seen them yet. I suspect they're currently silver ranked in ('competitive' game here) and are playing that instead. I'm assuming it died about a month after release on account of being boring, repetitive and horribly unbalanced. I myself played it for about a day.  Oh and let's not forget the (Rushed? I don't know, but it literally brings nothing new to the game whatsoever) new perk. Because we weren't insulted enough with the delays, unwanted 'content' updates and questionable business practices already, right?  I want to like this game. At some point in time I did. Somewhere underneath it all there actually is a truly great game trying to break free of the things holding it down. Unfortunately it can't, and never will.",-1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Killing Floor 2 is the sequel to the popular survival shooter where you are pitted against massive waves of zeds which want to feast on your flesh.   Killing Floor 2 for me at the very least is improved in every way possible. It fixes a lot of the problems the original had, but it brings new problems along, but in general Killing Floor 2 is still a fantastic game.  There's no story to speak of in Killing Floor, but there's is a story in general. There's a virus which turns people to zombies and civilians band together with soldiers to fight the virus on the streets of Paris, London and Germany and in general all over the world.  Gameplay wise, this game is played mostly in a survival mode. So each game you have to survive for a few waves where you then face off against two types of bosses. One is the Patriarch and the other one is Dr Hans. Patriarch has a mini gun and a rocket launcher to fight you off and Dr Hans has a toxic gas and explosives.  The game also let's you pick a certain class like sharpshooter, gunslinger, firebug or support. These classes are built on what play style you prefer, so if you like burning everything alive pick firebug, if you like to use ranged weapons use Sharpshooter.  Now I felt that the classes in the first one were all balanced, while some were overpowered all of them had great qualities which made them fun to play, this time however I feel that that classes are a bit off. Like the firebug class not doing a lot of damage with the flamethrower.  The game also has new classes like a SWAT class which uses SMGs and a Survivor class which is a jack of all trades so you will find a class that suites you the best.  Graphically the game looks great and runs great. Fully maxed out the game runs fine even in the moments where the screen is full of stuff being ripped apart.   The soundtrack is also great, where you listen to heavy metal while shredding through waves and waves of zeds. While not every track is great, a lot of them are really good.  Overall Killing Floor 2 is a great sequel and has a ton of replay value. It's definitely one of the games you can come back and play from time to time. While it has slight issues with classes and other stuff I highly suggest checking this game out.  Final Rating: 9/10  Pros: + Runs and looks great + Fun gameplay + Tons and Tons of replay Value  Cons: - Classes aren't balanced ",1,1

232090,Killing Floor 2,"I have spent around 170 hours on this game and although not all of it is bad, I simply can't recommend this game.  For starters the positives of the game: Graphics Soundtrack Gore system   The negatives: Unlike the first game where there was a lot of depth to classes like flinch locking with m14 for sharpshooter or taking down fleshpound with a Lar, or with support doing the standing shot, supermanshot, crouching shot, against scrakes, bezerker locking the patty and many many more tricks than I have the time to list here; all of these tricks require many many hours to master making for a game that has a very high skill ceiling and rewards you for skill. KF2 fails specatularily here. KF2 classes are very superficial, the majority of classes scale very poorly with skill making for a very casual game that gets boring very quickly. Simply, all the tricks that made kf1 fun for many past the 500 mark is gone. In all honestly you can master the game in around 100 or 200 hours. Really not worth the investment, as by then you will mostly be bored of the game and end up moving on.  Sprinting-In kf1 there was no way to sprint, instead you had to be careful with your movements and positioning so you wouldn't get boxed in and if you were moving from point a to point b you had to think ahead as to how to clear the paths ahead so you wouldn't get boxed in and killed. In kf2 this doesn't exist, instead you have a sprint mechanic which can practically bail you out of any situation so you never have to worry about positioning. Sprinting is so essential to gameplay in kf2 that before the game begins you should press whatever key you have sprint bound to and tape the key down cause you will never be letting go of it and holding it down the entire time can be painful on the hand.  Zed sprinting- So tripwire wanted to make a fast paced game unlike the first game. While this does sound exciting in theory, it completely and utterly fails with the way kf2 is designed. Instead it encourages the use of classes that can kill zeds very quickly with body shots like support, firebug, demo, zerk, etc. Classes like sharpshooter, which was one of the most entertaining classes of kf1 because of it's skill requirements, but now it's a very dumb down and boring perk to play which has been relegated to killing scrakes and fleshpounds(the minibosses of the game) with a railgun that can 2 shot fleshpounds and 1 shot scrake on hell on earth difficulty. Other classes like commando and gunslinger also suffer here.  So in summary, I can't recommend this game simply because it suffers from typical(next generation bad game syndrome) aka visually stunning, great gun sounds, great gore systems, good soundtrack, overall very pretty game, but horrible and extremely repetitive gameplay with a very low skill ceiling that deters people from sticking around after they have leveled up all their perks to level 25.",-1,0

This is a good thing. +More Music, always a nice touch. +More perks (Though the Survivalist perk kinda makes all the others seem redundant, but that's just me)  NEGATIVES: -So you promised more zeds? I don't see any, unless you're talking about the two clot varients and Hans, which besides Hans is absolutly abyssmal. -You cannot host a server for friends in-game. Instead, you have to go OUTSIDE OF THE GAME and download+fiddle around with a program. How the hell do you mess up something that was in KF1? -Microtransactions, and on top of that CS:GO-style microtransactions. I don't need elaborate on why this is a bad thing. -New Fleshpound. Bigger isn't always better guys, now he just looks like a doofy weight-lifter with a blender on his hands. -Small, claustrophobic maps. Now, these are a good thing regularly, especially with a game like this. However, WHEN YOU HAVE _JUST_ SMALL MAPS IT'S A PROBLEM. -Design. Where did the grittiness from KF1 go? Ain't here, that's for sure. No-sir-ee-bob, just Future and metal. Weeeee. -New PvP gamemode. Why? Now you have to balance a game that is abotu PvE around it's PvP element. Where's the fun in that? (Although A for effort in trying to add a new game-mode) -Hey, remember how Bloats and Sirens were annoying but manageable in KF1? Those were the days, huh? Now Bloats are bullet-sponges and Sirens pack metal armor that just ping off your shots. So do Fleshpounds, but I'm giving them a pass for that making them more threatening than annoying like the other two. -KF2 has no charm. The only reason I remember KF2 is because it's the sequel to KF1 and that it's what taught me never to buy Early-Access games.  TL;DR: KF2 is inferior to KF1. Don't waste your money on this, buy KF1 instead.",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Good start, bad end, lazy greedy devs.  -no endless mode that was meant to be ready for release -no 10th perk, survavalist is just a lazy effort for say hey we coded half day to do it -no new weapons -still pretty unbalanced -moderator and devs abuse of power banning everyone -some weapons sounds are placeholder (ak12, medic weapon rifle, sub machine for swat and medic) still fun game to play from time to time, grab it on 75% discount just for the way TWI during all the EA acted to their customers, changing priority and ton of lies.",-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,"Perks Fix  Its not the first time that I complain about this perks and it wont be the last either if TWI doesn't fix them. I am not saying that the other perks are perfectly designed at the moment(especially survivalist which is a joke) but these 3 need some serious review and fix.   Let's start with berserker, the biggest problem of this perk is it being way too OP at the moment to a point it's game breaking, and I am sick and tired of seeing skilless players clutching waves of team wipe just because they were playing as zerk. With Skirmisher, Vampire and Berserker rage on board you get 3 out of 5 perk skills that can restore HP on top of the standard syringe healing. Resistances are fine at the moment as they kinda defines zerk, but all these features, with speed bouns added together then it's not fine because you simply get not only the strongest, but also an OP perk in game. You can run through siren stacks, husk groups, bloat mines easily and make it out alive without even swiping your weapon once and that's just not right. You can just keep running away from raged scrakes and fleshpounds because they either will never be able to catch up or you will have full HP again by the time they land a lucky hit on you which dosent hurt at all. So who needs to risk fighting a raged zed when you can just hold sprint and run away from everything? I thought the whole point of big zeds is to post a threat that you have do deal with immediately? Armour is nothing more than a piece of decoration for zerk and the only time you might actually need it is boss wave.   So to begin with the skirmisher skill needs to get fixed as it allows regeneration of 2 HP per second instead of 1 which is stated on the perk skill definition. Vampire is as good as it is meanwhile berserker rage needs to get fixed as well, make it can't be stacked alongside zed time extension then it's more fair. Resistances and HP restoring skills are fine but they should not be allowed together with run speed bonus, not 25% at least.   I've complained on Eviscerator before and I am not gonna repeat the details again, this weapon is far too effective against scrakes(and require very little skill) even it costs 1600 and weights 10 blocks. Don't even try to bring in comparisons like AA12 or railgun, because first of all they don't have recyclable ammo, and second they are not as effective(AA12) in killing scrakes or basically compromise your weapon layout(railgun), while zerk only needs a katana alongside Evis, which is a T2 weapon, can handle all small and medium zeds easily and doesn't need ammo at all. My suggestion is increasing the headshot requirement with Evis to at least 3 if not more.   Another perk that I have to complain about is Demo which is also OP as hell under the right circumstances, by that I mean with the protection from other perks which sounds reasonable until you actually play the game where all you will see is a demo hiding behind whatever perks and just bombard a position for an entire wave. The main reason for this is Demo has way too many ammo right now with M79 + RPG loadout, with the ammo boosting perk skill chosen you can have up to 60 shots of explosives to fire per wave. I am not implying that a high ammunition count will indefinitely lead to mindless bombarding playstyle, but it definitely encourages it because who give a **** about ammo management when you have so many spare shots? Not to mention Demo is perk where you don't need to worry about accuracy and still wrecks the zeds. The problem resulting from such high ammunition count is that it renders other perks useless because demo can just blow up everything on his own. I thought this game is about cooperation where different perks have different roles and now we got a perk that can do everything while other perks are just there to finish off a few small zeds that escaped from blasts occasionally? Are you serious Tripwire ?   To fix this perk the ammo count of M79 and RPG needs to be nerfed seriously, like 50% of the current state but damage and radius of explosions can be increased to compensate and to encourage skill shots. Shots should only be fired in case of emergency instead of at a constant rate and obscuring other perks from playing the game. Swat and commando are there to clean up small zeds and that should be their job not demo's.   RPG headshots on scrakes should be increased to 3 shots minimum, it should be used as an emergency measure not a fancy trick to replace the role of other perks. Scrake should have even higher body resistance to explosion/ blunt damage because now it takes like 3 shots to kill one? That's not quite enough to emphasize it's resistance against explosives as I still see demos shooting scrakes all the time.   That being said, the grenade capacity of demo can be increased to 10 and with a high stun power to give him ability to control large zeds. M16 203 could use more ammo(bullets) and reload mechanism needs to be separated where pressing R only reloads the clip and pressing MMB reloads the under-barrel grenade launcher. Door traps should do more damage, perhaps equivalent to a C4 to make it more useful. The damage of C4 can be massively increased to promote it's use and please remove that 3 seconds interval damage nerf( in case you haven't) which makes no sense at all, limiting the number of C4s that can be placed in map to 8 would be just fine(regardless of the number of demo players).   And lastly, firebug needs some good buff as it is too lame to use right now. You nerfed flame weapons damage because they cause too much damage ? Isn't that the whole concept of firebug? Dishing out massive damage at close range while being almost useless at medium range or above? And the microwave gun needs a good fix as it deals too little damage overall. Give it back it's advantage against scrakes like before and increase it's basic damage so it deserves the cost and weight as a T4 weapon. Right now firebug has zero contribution on large zeds elimination and all they can do is stirring **** up making life of other perks ten times harder.",-1,0

244850,Space Engineers,"This Review is VERY outdated! This is the review of the game back in December of 2013!  Thank you all for reading!     A bit about the game and developers.    Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works. Imagine it as Minecraft in space, where you can fly what ever you build by your own hands. This game is still in a very early Alpha stage, therefore you must know that a lot of things might, and most likely will change. Space Engineers is being developed by Keen Software House, which are the same guys behind Vrage and Miner Wars.    About Gameplay.   As said above, Space Engineers is something like Minecraft. Currently the game futures only Creative game mode, in which the player has unlimited resources. Player can just open his inventory, put the items into the toolbar and use how he / she wishes to use it. But there is a small twist. This game is not a voxel based game, therefore building something is much harder than most of the other games. You have to turn the object how you see fit. And putting other objects might be a bit hard, since the objects maybe won't be in a good angle.  There are many various items that you can use to build your small ship, big ship or a station. As it is probably obvious, You can fly small and big ship, but you can't fly a station. And you really wanted to make a huge carrier, didn't you? Well no problem! Just make a massive big ship. Make it so big that it can actually keep other big ships inside of it! Nothing and no one can stop you from doing that! Will it be slow? Of course it will, but you still did it! You can really build what ever type of a space ship or a space station that you wanted to. The game also has a lot of very nice parts that look nice inside of the stations, such as doors or inner walls, etc.  Everything in this game is destructible. And by that, i mean everything that you have built, or your friend. Even if it's an accident, you can't stop it. If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade it but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station and the ship. And the amazing thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look amazing!  I have to say, this game will have multiplayer in the future. The developers have already confirmed that a long time ago. And I can tell you, the multiplayer of this game is going to be amazing! Imagine four or five player building massive ships and stations. Gosh, I can't wait to do that! Even though the game is in very early alpha, and it really doesn't offer too much to do for now, exploring the current content of the game already showed me that this game has a lot of potential, and that it might actually have a very bright future!    Graphic and Audio   Graphically speaking the game looks very good, but it's nothing too special. The visual effects of explosions are very good, and destroyed items look amazing. The game's building 'blocks' don't look the same. In fact, they are built in a way that they keep 'continuing' each other all the time, therefore each part of your ship looks somewhat different. The game also futures coloring, therefore you can have a rainbow ship! Well, you can't really make that but you can try. Music on the other hand isn't anything too special. It's very fun at the beginning, but it gets rather repeatable after a while.    Pros, cons and final grade.   Pros: - Space sandbox building game. - Multiplayer in the future. - A lot of different 'blocks' with which you can make many, many different ships. - Ability to mine through the asteroids and get minerals. We will see what will we be able to use them for in the near future.  Cons: - Jet pack is very hard to use. - Flying anything is very hard, and there is almost no way to stop your ship mid-air. It will keep on flying away.  Final Grade: 7.5/10    Extra Info:   As mentioned earlier, this game looks very promising. I can guarantee that as soon as this game releases multiplayer, it will be much better and much more fun. We just have to wait and see what will the developers do!  And also, I wish everyone Happy holidays! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone!",1,0
244850,Space Engineers,"Added extra drills to a ship. Thrusters were too close and burned them down. Stopped in the middle of space to remove faulty thrusters. Forgot I can't break without them and crashed into friend's ship. Somehow survived, lost reactor in the process. Im now floating away into void, spinning like crazy.  11/10 would engineer again",1,1
244850,Space Engineers,"  Say goodbye to Minecraft-in-space sandbox games.     Space Engineers  is, in my opinion, a masterpiece and, while still under development, is most definitely worth your time and money if you're in to the creative sandbox 'genre.'  As of now, I won't criticize it too heavily since it is still in Early Access. However, I will review the general components of the game:   Graphics : The realistic graphical style of the game is quite fitting and very easy to look at, boasting a ton of high-quality textures. The lighting is also very well done.   Sound : The sound design is pretty solid, even though not all of it has been implemented. Although, the music soundtracks are very engaging and fitting. If the game had its own official OST, I would buy it personally.   Gameplay Mechanics : What's currently presented is quite impressive. However, there are some hiccups. As this is an Early Access game, you will most likely find bugs, glitches, and generally unfinished mechanics as you play. Once again, keep in mind that this game is still a WIP.   Multiplayer/Optimization : Now this is where the game currently falls short. The lag in multiplayer can become unbearable. Same can be said on singleplayer, although it is much less severe. Both instances of dropped framerate, both in MP and SP, are usually caused by either(or both) how many objects are in the world or the host's connection.   Thankfully, they have added dedicated servers, but they are still a WIP. With this kind of framerate issue, it is nearly impossible to have large-scale projects with you and/or your friends without a hint of dropped framerate. While the devs are working vigorously to optimize the game as a whole, it is probably a category of the game that won't be perfected for a while.   Replayability : This is something I really don't need to go into. It's a SANDBOX game! It only ever ends when you stop playing it entirely, and since there are essentially limitless things to do, there's an infinite amount of replayability.  While the game does suffer from optimization issues and unfinished mechanics, remember that this game is still in  Early Access.  It's not the final product.  With that said, here's my take on the rating system based on the game's current state:    Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Optimization: 4.5/10 Replayability: 10/10  Overall rating:  7/10 , a solid sandbox title, especially for the price of $20.00.   However, this rating could go up or down in the future. As this is an Early Access title, this rating is based on what the game is like now, not on how it will be in the future. I have high hopes for Space Engineers, and I hope it is all the Devs and the fans want it to be when it is released as a final product.",1,0

244850,Space Engineers,"Maybe it's just me, but I honestly dont love the game at its current stage. Im having lots of trouble with movement and it really ruins it for me, ships are too slow, and even nudging a small ship sends it spinning. Another problem is that you need to place thrusters on every surface of your ship to have any control. Honestly I wish that playing didnt feel like a challenge in itself. Rating: 4/10  Edit: 6/8/14 After playing the game more and enjoying the steady and content rich updates, I can safely say that this game has really become one that I would recommend. I love the new survival mode and the multiplayer is very seamless and well done. I hope that the game had a few more graphics settings but at this point I really do like it.

Oh by the way for you trolls out there, (You are gonna be happy for this!) You can create guns and kamikaze your ship into things.  Cons: You get one hit killed by rocks and their is no armor. Collecting Nickel for tools is really hard because there is barely any and it looks almost exactly like Iron. Ships tend to float off into space if you do not make it on a space station with gravity.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This is everything a remake should be: More items, more characters, more challenges, more bosses... More everything.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"+ The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane + New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.) + Game is amazingly smooth and clean + Too many achievements to count for + Too many hours spent in perspective + Best poop simulator EVER!  - Incompatible with social life outside the PC. - UPDATE: Had the music on the '+' but moved it here.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac with new graphics, new mechanics, new monsters, new items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced. New content has been added everywhere possible, the game feels infinitely smoother, is so much nicer to play, and has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer. If you enjoyed the original Binding of Isaac, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is going to be infinitely better and I can promise instant satisfaction. This review will consist of comparisons between the original and Rebirth, what’s good, what’s bad, possible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind. It is often a bit rambly, because I talk extensively about every detail I like and every component that irks me. For a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the review, visit the last paragraph.  A basic introduction to Binding of Isaac overall is an attempt to run away from your Mother who is trying to kill you. You run into the basement, where you find various items which can be beneficial, harmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving. You shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage. Once you die, that run is over. The game is perma-death, so you have to start again from scratch. The game is also absolutely  disgusting . There isn’t too much blood, but knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basement, been transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross. Once you get past the horrid enemies, the game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like this..   This game has a bunch of different characters, all of which have different unique aspects. Some characters are easier to play than others, which in the eyes of many people, makes those characters more fun. I wish the characters were more balanced, but it’s very rarely possible to have 10 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty. There are bound to be some easier, more fun and more interesting characters, and that’s what makes them unique. Something that’s missing from the classes however, is all the characters being unique. Some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similar, and some of the things that made characters unique in the original Binding of Isaac have disappeared in Rebirth.  Samson no longer starts with a soul heart along with 1 red heart, an interesting aspect of Samson that made him a challenge in the original game. Rather, he starts with 3 red hearts, probably to accompany the change in the item of Bloody Lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor. This is an interesting change, but it makes Samson more of a tanky character, similar to Magdalene, rather than the weaker character with more potential. I believe a better change would have been to give Samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the original, and the effect of Bloody Lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining it’s effect over the floor.  Lucky Foot, the item that made Cain a fun character to play in the original, has been significantly nerfed, making Cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect. While Lucky Foot is still a luck up, a single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well. If the Lucky Foot could still make the Fortune Machine work all the time, or at least most of the time, and increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just one, Cain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more unique.  A good addition to Rebirth is that all the stats are finally given good use and are recorded. The luck stat is used in everything it should, with a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficiently, all methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape. They’ve also shown all the stats, including shot speed and luck as previously mentioned, on the pause screen, which were not there in the original game.  There are some enemies in the game that have been made impossible to fight. Bloat is a boss that shoots brimstone like lasers out of his eyes, which wasn’t too bad in the original but in this game there is no ‘tell’ (something that means he’s going to do a certain attack) for when he is going to shoot it, and before you can move out of the way, there is a laser and you’ve been hit. The same thing applies to the Lumps in the womb and the Mom eyes in the red champion Mom fight, which shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot. There are a lot of enemies that do similar things, and still a lot of rooms remain where it’s almost impossible to leave without taking damage.  Something I noticed that’s new in Rebirth is that everything from the original now has an equivalent. Every form of fly-related enemy now has a spider version that does the same thing, and a lot of similar aspects like that. It makes the game more uniform, because now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the game.  Easily one of the best new additions in Rebirth is the ability to save your progress in a run. You can stop it at any time, close the game, and start again from where you left off at a later point. You can’t start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous run’s data, but it’s still an extremely useful feature, since in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of BoI.  One of the more fun new additions is rooms of varying sizes. They aren’t anything like a random size, but they can now be a single normal room, as all the rooms were in the original BoI, they can be double rooms extended either horizontally or vertically, and they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions. The animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sickness, and it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files (I’m not quite sure what). Personally, I quite like the animation, and it makes moving around large rooms extremely fun.  Overall, this game is easily worth the $15 if you liked the original Binding of Isaac, and at the time of the making of this review there was no DLC released (if there ever will be any), so that might be added in the future. This is an action packed perma-death roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"1 And it came to pass after these things, that Edmund McMillen did tempt gamers, and said unto them, gamers: and he said, Behold, here I am.  2 And he said, Take now thy cash, thine only cash till next pay period, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Steam or Sony; and offer it there for 10 to 15 USD (dependent upon loyalty discount), offering upon one of the consoles which I will tell thee of.  3 And the gamers rose up early in the morning, and saddled their Honda Civics, and took two new Taco Bell Breakfast Crunchwraps, and their cash, and rose up, and went unto the place of which Edmund had told them.  4 Then on what felt like the billionth day the gamers lifted up their eyes, and saw the place afar off.  5 And they said unto their Crunchwraps, Abide ye here with the Honda Civics; and I and the cash will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.  6 And the gamers took their cash; and they went both of them together.  7 And the cash spake unto the gamers, their owners, and said, My owners: and they said, Here am I, my cash. And he said, Behold the cart, full: but where is the cash for offering?  8 And the gamers said, My cash, Edmund McMillen will provide himself cash for an offering: so they went both of them together, because mediums of exchange are incapable of critical thinking.  9 And they came to the place which Edmund had told them of; and the gamers chilled there, and placed the order, and bound their cash and laid him on the altar of purchase.  10 And the gamers stretched forth their hands, and inched their cursors towards confirmation.  11 And Tyrone Rodriguez called unto gamers out of Nicalis, and said, gamers, gamers: and he said, Here am I.  12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the cash, neither do thou any thing unto it: for now I know that thou fearest cancellation; seeing thou hast not withheld thy cash, thine only cash for this pay period.  13 And the gamers lifted up their eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a northern lion: and the gamers went and took the northern lion, and criticized him for taking Mom's Knife, in stead of their cash.  14 And the gamers called that game Rebirth: as it is said to this day, In the mount of Indie it shall be seen.  The Binding of Isaac, released back in 2011, is a rogue-like indie darling that wears its Zelda influences on its sleeves. You play as Isaac, a young boy living with his mother. His mother, convinced she is being spoken to by God, must offer Isaac up to prove her love and devotion to Him. Isaac, in an understandable act of defiant self-interest, descends into the basement to escape. It's there that the game begins. You fight all manner of monstrosities down below, ranging from hideous pin worms, cleft-lipped disembodied heads, physical manifestations of the Seven Deadly Sins, and the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.   You start fighting the denizens of your basement with your tears – yes, this game is a strange one – but as you progress you'll find unlockables (in stores, treasure rooms, arcades, etc.) that change your tear effects, sometimes drastically (and sometimes your appearance). To win you have to juggle health, bombs, keys, and money. You'll have to find secret rooms (and secreter rooms!). And of course, you'll have to fight... well, I won't spoil THAT. Suffice it to say you'll have some options. As you play, succeed, and succumb, you'll unlock items and characters for each subsequent playthrough. On top of that, items you find and unlock, enemies you encounter, and floor layouts all change with each descent – effectively making every run unique. The Binding of Isaac is one of the most highly replayable games around, with many players logging in hundreds if not thousands of hours.  It's a troubling trend lately that games have been getting the HD rerelease treatment so quickly after initial launch. The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs, Metro – all have come out recently, all have had rereleases in fairly quick succession. It's no secret that gamers are suckers for a good dose of nostalgia, and that we're willing to pay top dollar for games we loved years ago that haven't necessarily weathered the passing of time so well. Now publishers are testing gaming goodwill with the constant stream of HD ports, definitive editions, remasters, and remakes.  It's been three years since Isaac's first appearance, and now he's back in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. And just like way back in 2011 when he first burst onto the scene, he's stolen the show yet again. I've explained the core mechanics and features of the game in a previous paragraph, so I won't get all redundant on you. Instead I'll tell you what's new in Rebirth. New enemies, regular and boss types. New floor layouts. Bigger floors. New items. New trinkets (items you carry with you that result in an effect – Pink Eye gives you poison shots, Cancer increases number of tears, etc.). New challenge runs. More item synergies. More characters to play as. “Seeds” that allow you to choose a particular run. Hard mode for you masochists. Couch drop in/drop out co-op, ingeniously designed where a second player can take health from the first player and becomes a unique familiar, providing backup until death (as long as you have health to spare, you can respawn). Controller support. New soundtrack from Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans. More secrets. The ability to save. Chocolate ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.   …  Okay, not that last bit.   I could go on. Needless to say they took The Binding of Isaac and its DLC, Wrath of the Lamb, and compiled it into a single rerelease. Then they went and gave it a new splash of paint and hundreds of hours of content. Graphics are spectacular and detailed, the style is lovingly Zelda inspired, the music is fresh and exhilarating, enemies pop upon death, viscerally gratifying... it's truly a delight. If I have a minor niggle, it's that Rebirth feels kind of floaty compared to Vanilla Isaac, a little too fast – but that just might take some getting used to. It certainly hasn't deterred me. For players old and new Rebirth is at once familiar and exotic, and I predict that regardless of prior experience with Isaac you'll find yourself experiencing some gaming de ja vu. It really, truly is a gamer's game; a loving homage to why we picked up controllers in the first place.  But half the fun, my uninitiated friends, is discovering all this for yourselves... the bosses (and tactics required to take them down), the items, the secrets. It's a challenging game, I won't sugarcoat it. But pressing forward and beating that first boss, getting to a new level, glimpsing the final boss... all of these milestones are as rewarding as gaming experience get, period. And once you start at it, you won't stop. That's what those save files are for.   This is the indie game of the year. This is the only indie title you really need to buy in 2014... for fans of the series, for those unfamiliar, for sentient animals, and for any extraterrestrials and apparitions within earshot. You owe it to yourself to buy this, a title retro and modern all at once. This puts all of those HD rereleases, definitive editions, and remakes to shame. This is truly a rebirth; for indie games, for players, for devs and publishers... for gaming. The bar has been raised.  So what are you waiting for? Repent, every one of you, in the name of RNGesus for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of Rebirth.  ",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Disclaimer: This game has a steep learning curve. The basis of this game is knowledge, the community spreads their knowledge, almost making a meta. The Binding of Isaac is a very fun game for me and I love it's art style. That being said here are some pros and cons:  Pros: 1. Precise gameplay (in terms of movement, shooting and the bullet hell aspects.) 2. Wide variety of bosses 3. Randomized everything! 4. Great soundtrack! 5. Wide variety of characters 6. (With Afterbirth) Interesting greed mode with cool final boss 7. Great community!  Cons: 1. Very hard to memorize what _____ Item does. (maybe its just me, idk) 2. Ouch! Alot of bullet hell aspects. (Im bad at those)  Anyway, the cons are pretty much because those are my personal issues with it.

BoI was one of my favourite games from the past few years, and I never thought it could be so much better. Well, it is. Rebirth takes the addictive formula from the flash version of BoI/WotL and made it even more satisfying and addictive this time. The controls are so smooth, the graphics are spot on, and you can tell how much love was put into this game. I simply cannot put this game down, and I highly recommend picking this game up, it is worth every single penny.  *Updated for Steam Awards*  I nominated BOI:R for the 'Just 5 More Minutes Awards' because everytime I play I find it hard to stop, and 'One more run wouldn't hurt' ends up being 5 hours.",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"ok heres a real review. Now I haven't played the first game that much, but I could already see all of the great improvements. Pros: -It's not laggy -You can see the enemies easier -It's easier to hear that you got hurt -A lot more items -More characters -Music is higher quality -Overall better performance -Improved animations -If you need to leave to go somewhere you can save by just quitting. -Multiple save files so if you share your steam with someone or just want to restart without losing progress you can do so. Cons: -memes. There are still memes. 10/10",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"After playing this for a little while, it ALREADY blows away all my expectations. As someone that has 500+ hours in the original, they were very high to begin with. The music is FANTASTIC, I still can't get over it. You have a difficulty option now, you can chose to play on normal or hard. This is great, as when you played the first sometimes it got too easy with everything unlocked! You have save files now, and can resume a run where you left off. No more leaving the game running for hours as you go to the store. Full controller support, dunno about a lot of different controllers, but it works flawlessly with an xbox 360 controller. You have a lot of new exciting items and power-ups. Things that were never possible in the first. More challenges, different room sizes and types, the list goes on. I had very high hopes for this, and already this gets everything right, even better than I had expected in the first place. This is a must, even if you didn't like the first binding of isaac, since it fixes a LOT of issues that most people had with the first. Highly recommended 10/10",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,The Finding of Items: Restart.,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remastering of the original 2011 Binding of Isaac in short. The game play hearkens back to old school top-down 16-bit games. The most notable and recognizable being the Legend of Zelda titles for inspiration. In essence, the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a rouge-like RPG where you play as Isaac (or one of the other unlockable characters) and you must traverse the basement of your house to escape the wrath of your mother, who hears from the voice of God and is told that you must be sacrificed. This premise sets the tone of the game being very creepy and unsettling as you defend against all manners of your lost brothers, sisters, creatures, and other grotesque monstrosities. Eventually leading to a showdown with your own mother as well (and even beyond that if you get good at the game and carry on).  What makes the Binding the Isaac such a great title comes from it's solid game play elements. The game play itself is very easy to understand at first, but becomes very deep with the inclusion of the upgrades via the rogue-like elements (easy to understand + difficult to master + luck of the draw + perma-death = Isaac in a nutshell). In order to get far into a run, you will need upgrades, and a lot of them. Isaac by default will only be able to fire his tears at the enemies in only the four cardinal directions, but many different upgrades can alter his tears or give them new effects. This is what can make or break a run in Binding of Isaac. Be warned, not all the upgrades are positive, which adds to the rogue-like elements, as some are ultimately poor or are only used in certain situations and can ruin a run, resulting in failure (high risk and high reward situations are the nature of the game). It is the element of luck the drives you to start up another run, see what upgrades and item combinations you will encounter each time. In this remastering of Binding of Isaac, there is the heavy emphasis on item/upgrade synergy. Coming across interesting item combinations and seeing how they interact with one another can create those overpowered moments (Brimstone plus Tammy's Head for example creates a short Brimstone shots in all directions when Tammy's Head is used) that make you feel like a god within the game, or create a silly combination where you have to work twice as hard just to clear a room.  So what if you already have played the original Binding of Isaac, what should you expect this time around in the remastering? In short, a lot more when compared with the original. More items and upgrades have introduced into the item pool, new bosses and enemies to encounter (for better or worse), a whole new art style very reminiscent of Gameboy Advance titles (pixel art style with a pixel smoother option in the options menu for those who prefer not to look at rigid pixels), seeded run options, 2-player local co-op play, controller support with analog stick integration, new soundtrack, three save slots, new lighting effects, and well just more to be honest. The sheer amount that was added to the game is staggering when compared to the original. Even at the $15 USD price, it still feels well worth the investment. You can get several hours in just from doing a few runs and seeing how far you will get and what crazy item combinations you will come across, or what new items/characters you will unlock for later runs. It is a challenging game no doubt, but I will admit that having one of those moments where you just barely defeat final boss of your run with only one health bar left, is nothing short of gratifying. If you have any slight interest in the rogue-like genre, this is genuinely a great title to try and own.

Really- what's not to like? To this day, I still play it and enjoy watching myself suffer the consequences of trying to kill Gurdy Jr. With Rebirth out, it should be no surprise that I pick this game up.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The original Binding of Isaac was released back in 2011 and was pretty much the effort of two or three people, the game on a chronically horrible Flash interface. The original is still pretty great.  However, comparing the original and the remastered Binding of Isaac is like the difference between a regular membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. You won't notice the difference immediately, but it will stick in your mind if you go back to the original.   Rebirth plays much better in comparison via subtle changes to the formula. The main differences between the original and the remastered edition include 160+ new items, native gamepad support (thank jebus), a new set of gameplay and difficulty tweaks (Hard mode being a big tweak for cool kids who like to unlock more things on top of their already unlocked things), and the game engine running at 60FPS all times every times (except when you alt-tab to something else, I've noticed, but I'm not going to hit the developers for that).  It's a worthy addition to a classic, and I don't know if I can go back to playing the original now, since this supercedes it by a mile. Honestly, the only people I imagine who would complain about this are frustrated teenagers who don't get allowances and those awful pedantic ♥♥♥♥s on Steam who use the forums to complain about refunds every time the pre-orders don't get released on time.",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I've got nearly 400 hours on the original Binding of Isaac. When I preordered Rebirth, it felt almost obligatory. It had so much to live up to! My thought process was, 'Well, I'm sure I'll at least get my money's worth, and that guy is welcome to some more of my money after the cost vs. enjoyment of the original.'  IT IS PROBABLY EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. I'll rack up hundreds of hours on this one too, I'm sure. The game is cleaner and faster, you don't get shot in the foot by randoming the wrong items, and YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR GAME. So now if you're in the middle of a good play and someone is like, 'Hey let's go out to dinner,' you don't have to just leave the game running the entire time you're gone.  So yeah. Recommend.",1,1

However if you can play your cards right (sometimes literally), you can own the game and become death, the destroyer of floors.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake of the flash game made by Edmund McMillen. A game I've been anticipating for a very long time. Everyone who doesn't have it might be wondering if it live up to the hype, is it better than the original? Is it a good game at all?   Absolutely.   Rebirth is an improvement on the original isaac in every single way imaginable. The art style, the gameplay, controller support, save files, everything you can think of is better in Rebirth. Its absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, and its only been 2 days! The game is everything I expected it to be and more. I can't say enough about how much of a pleasure it is to play this game. The original brought me into the genre of the roguelike/lite. And this one draws me in even more with all the incredible items and synergys.   I've heard people complain about the soundtrack, I really don't understand why. Its much better in my opinion, its more of a background ambient sound rather than an in your face track, and I find that fits this game incredibly well. The arcade and boss music is especially good. The only complaint that I've had issue with is keyboard problems occasionally, but its so minor and rarely affects anything, at least for me.   Rebirth is truely one of the best games I've played, and will probably be my game of the year. What are you waiting for?! Go pick up Rebirth and play the best rougelike to date.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"After spending hundreds of hours in the original binding of isaac i was pretty sceptical about rebirth. To be honest i didn't expect it to have the same impact. But i was proven wrong sooooo wrong. After the first few minutes i got hooked again and can't stop playing since. More items, sick synergies, fun and creative challenges, coop, great graphics GREAT new soundtrack and smooth gameplay (no more slowdowns caused by the crappy flash engine). The only downside at this moment are some minor bugs.   However if you're looking for a reason for not get Rebirth, here's one: After playing rebirth for the first time the original binding of isaac will become a waste of space in your library since you never ever gonna thouch it again.",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' is everything you could want from an action roguelike: It's fun, has a ton of features, it's addictive and has a huge replay value.   With 450+ items and 4 billion seeded runs, you'll play the game for years and years and will always see something new each playthrough.   This is my first time playing TBOI and I loved it! I can't recommend enough. See you in the basement!",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebith... Where do I even start?  Pros: -Infinite Replayability: You can play this over and over again, and never find the same floor layout, same items, same enemies. -Creativity: The game has items ranging from satanic headless babies leeking blood to damage enemies, to a glass of milk that spills when you take damage, enemies ranging from deformed children with bombs implanted in their heads, to demon versions of Isaac that mimic his every move, characters that range from a laser-firing demon, to a glass cannon disguised with a fez, and bosses that range from a large poop, to MEGA SATAN. F*CKING MEGA SATAN! -Items: The items can sometimes be bad which gives the game a nice balance. Sometimes, you'll pick up an item that makes you Jesus, and other times, you'll pick up an item that makes you want to restart the run, even if you're right about to beat the boss. -Enemies: The enemies are very challenging and annoying sometimes, but if you know how to take them out, you can very efficiently power your way through rooms and floors, murdering everything in your wake, but if you don't know how to beat them, you'll get eaten by a tiny baby spider. -Bosses: The bosses can be really annoying sometimes, other times challenging, and occassionally, pushovers. The bosses all over all, are very creatively designed too, as mentioned above in the 'Creativity' section. -So Much Fun: This game has kept me entertained for HOURS, and I'm still nowhere close to being done, especially after purchasing the DLC. I could see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours, and never getting bored. -Afterbirth: The one and only DLC for Isaac is a doozy, adding plenty of new items, enemies, room layouts/sizes, bosses, and hours of gameplay to the mix. It even adds a new gamemode, and overall, makes the game harder, so only get it if you want an extra challenge.  Cons: -Sound: This may just be my computer, but I've always had a problem with the sound. It's extremely loud, even if I only have it one notch up. -Difficulty: The game can be quite challenging at times, and although that adds to the overall charm of the game, I feel it could be toned down a notch without negative effect. -Overwhelming: As a new player, the amount of content in the game can overwhelm you. I practically live on the Isaac Wiki while playing, and I've played for a while. With how many items there are, you won't know what a lot of them do until you've played the game for a while. -Characters: There are certain characters in the game that seem very overpowered *cough* Azazel *cough*. I feel like this throws off the balance a lot, as many will play Azazel for a long time and beat everything with him, and then they'll move on to another character, and be extremely unprepared for playing the other characters, who, compared to Azazel, can be quite challenging to use.  Thank you all for reading my review, and I really hope it helps you make your decision about purchasing this amazing game!",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Now here's the deal: You have re-release (upadated release is probably the closest thing you can call this) here. It costs three times more than the original (without counting DLC, Wrath of the Lamb). Question is: Is it any worth?   Oh yeah, it's absolutely worth of all the pennies I paid from it      Super smooth; due new engine, it works very smoothly. Fantastic!    Local Co-Op; Haven't tried, but it's always a plus!    New items &amp; item combinations. Be creative. Break the game for your benefit!    New enemies &amp; bosses. More blood to splatter!    Normal and Hard modes; True, I haven't tried Hard yet, but for more hardcore group of players, it must mean something (right?).    More characters; More reasons to play! Play as Eden, who has all stats and items randomed!   ...And so much more. Animated cutscenes. More bodyhorror.   The only thing which so far isn't as good as in original Isaac is soundtrack in my opinion. However, it's not that bad either now that I've played Rebirth more and it definitely fits here, I just find Baranowsky's soundtrack much more enjoyable. Points on music playing in Arcade, though!  And for recommendation part, it's bit... tricky. Chances that you loved original Isaac, you already own this. Chances are that if you didn't care for original Isaac, you really don't care about this either. But new to Roguelike genre? There's no finer way to introduce yourself to the genre than this game!

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Substantially better than its predecessor. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is what you think of when a game lives up to its hype. The creators—Edmund McMillen and Nicalis—have done a great job of designing not only a great remake of the original, but a great game worthy of its own merit. You should think less of Rebirth as a remake, and more of it as a pseudo-sequel that just happens to have all of the original content a la the Pokemon franchise for a similar experience.  The gameplay, which is a dungeon-crawling twinstick shooter just like the original, has enough variety that every run will be different. There's permanent death in the game, so be warned—the game is difficult and you will die, but your overarching progress will be saved. That's part of the draw for a lot of the community, since you start from scratch with each 30 minute to 1 hour run.  All in all, I can't recommend this game enough, and if you're a fan of the original you will most likely adore this one. My pick for 'Game of the Year' for 2014.   ",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac is on it's surface a rather childish narrative of poop jokes and weird body horror, but upon further reflection and piecing together of the non-linear story, one comes to realize that Isaac is a wholly unique, fairly depressing, and highly important narrative. Isaac is a child with everything stripped from him, his ability to choose, his ability to move around, his very humanity is offered up in the name of sacrifice. But unlike so many other narratives about child abuse, Isaac is a game that does not end with a child falling to the knife of his authoritative figures, but rather making his own choices, whether to live or to die.   Isaac's struggles are given serious attention even amidst all the giant poop monsters, and I truly believe this game can absolutely be a cathartic experience to some of us out there who maybe didn't always have the chance to make our own fight in life.",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"10/10 I love the OST but I'll get to that in a minute.  The game itself was done PERFECTLY. It's remade exactly how I would want. Gameplay is so smooth, it's beautiful, and it has all the content from the Original and Wrath + more. This is EXACTLY how I want to play the game, and I'm glad I stopped playing BOI to wait for this.  Now on to the Ost...   I think the issue is that the Danny B soundtrack just fit the game SO well. I think it was nearly a fluke how the music just gave you that extra sense of being creeped out and feeling bad for the denizens of the Basement and below. Sure, he's ultra talented and I'm sure he set out for the creepy vibe, but who would have thought how perfectly it would set the mood for the game.   For me, the music would actually trigger an emotion to what I was seeing...thinking about these poor kids down there having to live in their own feces, getting sick, forming growths and turning into monsters. It actually made me feel a bit ill and disturbed. I'm not sure if that's good or bad but it's certainly rare in both games and film to accomplish that.  Basically, I think if it wasn't for the Original OST, people would be amazed with the new one. It's awesome, but you can't recapture COMPLETELY what the first one did. It comes damn close though.",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Isaac has some problems in his family. His mother, watching a religious TV program, decided to kill her son in sacrifice to God. The kid managed to jump into the basement, a network of catacombs, densely populated by a huge amount of monsters. And the only weapon he has are his tears.  In The Binding of Isaac Rebirth you clean room by room, collect bonuses, find hidden places and shops, and then defeat the boss and jump into the next door in the floor. A new level begins and it gets harder and harder. You do so a few times before meeting his mother, then Satan himself or someone else.  The Binding of Isaac is challenging, really difficult. The farther you get, the easier it is to die and then you have to start from the very beginning. But there are many items which help you to become stronger. So many that I even used the Isaac Wiki to get the full understanding of every item and situation in the game (it really helps!). One item teaches Isaac to jump (finally!), other causes tears or enemies to explode and hurt everyone around. You can upgrade your max HP (Hearts), the devil will sometimes reward you with the power of the dark side (wings and other strong abilities for some of your hearts). The style of play often changes radically in the middle of the race. You just scribbled tears in different directions, hardly finishing even the smallest creep and then you suddenly get a power-up that changes your whole gameplay and you kill even the hardest boss without any problems. But the thing is, it can be the other way round, too! It is also always interesting to see how every item affects Isaac, because every item changes his appearance, so each time he looks different: he acquires tumors, horns or a bloody grin, pulls mom's bra on his head or... something else.  Failure is a part of the process. Play, die, start again, play, die, again. But every time we get something new (achievements open new items), so you do not want to stop completely.   Rebirth added a lot of new enemies, bosses, items and secrets if you compare it with the original game. And this is good! Edmund McMillen and his colleagues made an excellent job. A game full of the most horrible fears, bitter tears of childhood and exciting ideas.   You can also play it with you friend locally. But it’s not the local multiplayer you’d expect. Instead of a full second hero your partner takes control of a little Ghost accompanying Isaac. It can't go through doors or pick up items, it can only help to do more dmg. I would like more, although it is not clear how anything else would fit into the current mechanics.  So all in all this game is really fantastic! - 10/10! PS: There will be a new DLC soon. I’m definitely waiting for it!",1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Call of Duty: Basement Warfare is a masterfully crafted commentary on the degradation of society's morals. The main character, Captain Soap Price, callsign Isaac, is on a mission to tackle the deep-rooted fears that all humans have of ungodly things such as poop and basements. Taking a bold step away from a tried and true formula, CoD:BW is no longer a first person shooter. Players do not play as a badass soldier anymore either. In order to connect with the fanbase on a more personal level, the head of Nintendo decided that CoD:BW would place players in the shoes of the average Call of Duty player: a naked child who hates their mother (but ♥♥♥♥s mine all the time apparently).  However, what is most surprising about this CoD is the lovely message that the campaign has. By tackling his fears head on, he dies, meaning he can't be afraid anymore.That's some A+ Ernest Hemingway ♥♥♥♥ right there folks. Thanks to Isaac being a mix of Wolverine and Dr. Evil, however, he can try to kill his mother over and over until he succeeds and gets her to listen to his mixtape. This has the not-so-unexpected result of killing his mom again. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ off with your mixtapes.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Even someone with a little exposure to the Old Testament should recognize this tale of the same name. In the biblical tale of 'Binding of Isaac', God tests Abraham by commanding him to prove his devotion to Him. To do this he must sacrifice his son, Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to end Isaac's life, God demands for Abraham to stop and let his son live, sacrificing a lamb instead.  Christian religious symbols, items and connotations saturate The Binding of Isaac game. And yet the handling of such sensitive material is not mocking towards it's inspiration and it's not reverent. Instead, it's a fine line and one balanced masterfully. Only the most cynical Christians and non-Christians will find anything to take offense over.  Edmund McMillen, the up and coming indie superstar behind the rage inducing Super Meat Boy has released his most fun and inspired game yet. Being the best top-down shooter doesn't hurt either....but I'm getting ahead of myself.  Steam users most likely already know the sheer awesomeness that is The Binding of Isaac, but who knew that was just a taste of what Mr. McMillen had brewing up in his devilish head, next to a slab of meat and bandages. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth feels like a remastered version of the original Isaac with all of the content quadrupled, like a triple fudge cake with chocolate frosting and a chocolate core made of chocolate ice-cream....at least, I think it's chocolate.   For those new to the game, Isaac, at it's heart, is a top-down shooter that has 'borrowed' so much from the 8-bit Zelda I get the feeling a Nintendo lawsuit could be on it's way at any moment. For example, keys drop from enemies to unlock doors and chests, bombs are used to remove rocks and you gain more hearts as you progress through the stages.  In the basement with Isaac are a motley crew of deformed monsters who look like they were torn from a child's nightmare and are now dragging the floor with their ripped tendons and ligaments. Isaac keeps the fiends at bay by flinging tears like spears. Even horribly deformed monsters don't like being exposed to Ebola and other diseases by having bodily fluids flung at them. And to top it off, a massive boss resides at the end of the stage, guarding it's domain with a fierce tenacity. Isaac must maim and kill the beast so he can pass through to the next stage unmolested.   Don't think TBOI is just a crying simulator like Dark Souls. Isaac features rogue-like elements, which add random items which change nearly any and every game mechanic in some twisted, incredible way. The dungeons are different every trip through their dreary halls. These stages will be braved many times and the variety keeps things fresh and challenging. Like a room with trip lasers and machine-gun mounted turrents that change places every time you move out of their range.  The game mechanics are perfectly balanced, adding to the fun of the game. Do you use your last, precious bomb to free a key, which will open the item room? Is that prized key worth the extra heart which may keep you alive during the next boss fight? Balanced risk / reward scenarios such as these are what makes the game such a joy to play.  Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Or more accurately, the elephant poo in the room. Look, I don't know what Edmund McMillen was going through when developing Isaac and I'm pretty sure I don't want to know for the fear of becoming psychologically scarred but there are a lot......a LOT of piles of crap EVERYWHERE. In nearly every room, of every stage, throughout the entire game. There are poo monsters, poo bosses, poo power-ups and even special piles of poo with unique properties.   It's one thing to see Isaac murder an enemy, pull it's heart out and devour it like Jeffrey Dahmer, but it's totally another to see him pull a heart out of a pile of poo and pop it in his mouth. Those are the kinds of things you don't want to see because the nightmares won't stop, even after 'chats' with your psychologist.  Not all items are power-ups though. Some will grab your balls, wrap them around your neck and force you to finish the game that way. It's a gamble picking up an item you don't recognize, which will happen often as there are more items in the game than pitfall deaths in Super Mario. It's like bobbing for apples in a tank filled with chocolate eggs, apples and dead fish.  Items themselves are like little people. Some will instantly tell you who they are and what they do but others will require you to notice whats changed or missing when you review your security footage. It's an homage to older games when the developers didn't explain anything about their little cartridge of frustration and expected gamers to figure things out on their own. Half the fun of Isaac comes from discovering an innocent item hidden away only to find out later that it eats feces and likes to mouth-kiss.   TBOI is sort of like doing drugs. At first, you're just casually smoking a joint on the weekend with friends. But before the moon passes many times, you're laying in a building's doorway begging for money and stealing from your family just to feed your fix once more....alone and desperate.  With Isaac, playing a casual game here and there will do just fine. After all, you just want to beat the game. But then it creeps up on you. You'll come so close, just to have TBOI laugh at your feeble attempts. Not to spoil too much, but you CAN'T just stop after the credits. Play it more; let it fill your veins, satisfying your cravings and curiosity.  If limitless playtime isn't enough, there are bonus challenge levels which give you either a fun or debilitating set of items and task you with beating the game. One may require you with beat the game in near total darkness, except for a tiny light around your character. Others will give you a laser which kills everything in range, like a mother's angry looks. Only the most skilled of the elite players will be able to complete everything here and are really a well-thought out and fun bonus in a game already packed full of content.  I don't mean to read too much into the meaning of the game, but it seems to mirror the story of life. You'll have some good things and bad things happening to us but in the end, you'll go through a lot of ♥♥♥♥.   For the first time I've not had real negative quibbles, problems, and complaints with a game. Even after looking under every rock and corpse. That's as rare as finding a platinum Cheerio in your cocoa puffs. If you don't already own this game, purchase it immediately before the bad sense police find you and toss you into a poo-filled prison. Either way, you’re ending up in a poo-filled prison. Might as well make it this one.  This review and others posted at  censordodge.com ",1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth," TBOIR is a remake of the original binding of isaac. They added new items, new floors, new items, synergies, characters, and a new artstyle.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"One of the best games around. Especially for the price. The gameplay is like the dungeons in the original Legend of Zelda for the NES, but it's a good bit harder and you only have one life to do it all in. If you die, you start at the very beginning, pretty much empty handed. The levels and pickups are randomly generated, so it's a different game every time you play it. Even the bosses are randomly picked from a pool of possibilities, and each boss has several different versions that range from easy to very tough. There's a lot of variety here even though the game itself is simple and straightforward. You'll get many many quality hours out of this thing. Even if you already have the original, this one improves almost everything. It's smoother, prettier, harder, and there's a lot of new enemies and items that change the gameplay in significant ways. The only thing I really miss about the original game is the soundtrack. The new music is fine, but I prefer the original score. Other than that, this is one of my favorite games ever, and I've played a whole lot of them.",1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a remake of the original Binding of Isaac. The main difference with this version is the lack of mouse controls. There are also an added 3 final bosses and 17 new normal bosses.   Rebirth is a top down 2D dungeon crawler where the player controls Isaac. You venture through your mothers basement, and then moving onto Necropolis, Catacombs and even your mothers own womb. Rebirth also introduces local co-op, which is something I always like to see in games.   The dungeons look similar to that of Legend of Zelda, and the procedurally generated levels means you will never have the same run twice. In each dungeon room, you must eliminate all of the enemies before being allowed to move onto the next room. Along the way, players will collect money to buy equipment, find keys which unlock treasure chests and find power ups and weapons to increase Isaacs’s power.   Once you reach the latter stages of Rebirth, the difficulty really ramps up, and you will find yourself becoming very annoyed at yourself, but somehow you cannot stop yourself from playing because Isaac is such an addictive game.   You can complete a full run in Isaac in about 45 minutes give or take a little, so I've finished roughly 5 or 6 runs throughout my seven hours of playing, and each run I am still unlocking new power ups, characters and weapons to use in future runs.   Basically, if you don't have any Binding of Isaac games, you need to pick up Rebirth, it's everything the original game had, but done a lot better. This type of game you can pick up and play with ease, do a quick run here and there and you'll still have new things to find and explore.

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (or sometimes just called 'Rebirth', which I shall call it for this review) is a rogue like RPG made by Nicalis (who made Cave Story remakes and a VVVVVV port) under the supervision of Edmund McMillen, that is a sequel to the 2011 game, The Binding of Isaac, made by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl.  Rebirth, unlike the original, has much more content and much more replayability than the first game, adding new enemies, bosses, items, and characters for you to play with thanks to Rebirth being made on a non-Flash engine. Basically it is the original Binding of Isaac along with the DLC, Wrath of the Lamb with much more smoother gameplay, added features, and even more things to find and experiment with.  The story is the same as in the original : Isaac and his mother are living alone in a house, Isaac playing with his toys like a normal kid would, and his mother listening to Christian broadcasts on the television. However, Isaac's life takes a sudden turn for the worse when his mother starts hearing the voice of God himself, saying that her son has been corrupted. His mother, who wants to cleanse Isaac of all his sin, takes all of Isaacs belongings, even the clothing on his back, and locks him in his room, shutting him out from the outside world. However, God wants Isaac's mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac, so his mother grabs a kitchen knife and starts walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, in a state of panic, starts to search around his room for a way out, which he finds as a door to the basement. Just as Isaac's mother bursts into the room, Isaac jumps into the dark abyss, and that is where your game begins.  First off, the graphics in Rebirth are largely improved from the original, having 16-bit like graphics that make Rebirth look more retro than a sequel. Although it looks 16-bit, once the player starts to move around and get into the game, the game actually looks very smooth.  Being made on a non-Flash engine, Rebirth also runs very very smoothly, even when there is a ton of enemies or items on the screen, unlike in the original where having too many items on the screen would cause the game to lag or even crash all together.  Gameplay wise, Rebirth plays very similarly to the original, go around rooms, kill enemies that spawn in the rooms, pick up items, upgrade your character and fight the boss on the floor, then go to the next floor. Occasionally, after beating a floor, the player may find a new room before they go to the next floor that contains either a Devil Room or a Angel Room. The Devil Room allows players to permenantly trade in their health containers for various items, while the Angel Room gives the player a item for free. However, this game is not very forgiving, so expect to die a lot, not as much as Dark Souls, but a pretty decent amount.  There are a ton of new items in the game that have many different effects, as well as items from the original. As you fight your way through your foes, you may find money, keys, bombs, health, chests, cards, trinkets, or even upgrade or reusable items. For example, one of the newer items, Chocolate Milk, allows you to charge up shots before releasing the direction you wish to fire your shot, increasing its attack and shot size. These items can actually synergize with one another, causing very deadly combos that can make your run to defeat Mom much more easier. For example, Polyphemus, which makes your shots much more damaging, larger, and be able to pass through enemies if the shot kills them in one hit if your damage rating is higher while reducing the fire rate of your tears, combined with Chocolate Milk, can make a incredibly large and much much more damaging.  Much like the original, every time you start up a new game, all the items, enemies, and upgrades will be different. It literally cannot be the same game twice. However, thanks to the new Seed mode, you can write down the Seed of a run you have been doing, input it when you start a new game, and the map and all the upgrade room items will stay the same. However, doing this will disable any achievements you can earn for that run, which unlocks more items for you to find.  The sound has also been redone and the music is pretty upbeat, from the start of your adventures in Basment 1, to the retro beats of the Arcade, to the intense boss battle music, it makes you feel like you can actually make it to the end and beat Mom. Enemies also have some new sounds, as well as some more damage sounds when you get hurt.  Overall, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a major major improvement to the original, and is worth every penny. If you managed to read this far, I highly suggest you play the game yourself and experience the struggles that is Isaac's escape against Mom.",1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Game is very addictive. Gameplay and graphics already surpass the original issac by far. I think the soundtrack from the original is better though. Overall though, this may be GOTY material. I'm also hoping that they make DLC for this game as well.  Edit: Nevermind about the achievements. There are actually a lot more achievements than the first game. Around 174.  Honestly, I cant think of a better roguelike than this. If you guys can really think of a better one, then comment.",1,0

252950,Rocket League," Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...    Rookie  - You can't hit ♥♥♥♥. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.   Semi Pro  - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still ♥♥♥♥.   Pro  - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, ♥♥♥♥-head.   Veteran  - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!   Expert  - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.   Master  - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam 'Sorry!' every time they do something wrong to you.   Legend  - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of 'You're not good enough for Legend!'   Rocketeer  - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of 'You're not good enough for Rocketeer!'  But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)  If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).  Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.   EDIT - 2/13/2016:",1,0

252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in 'one more match' multiple times. That's how it's good.)  The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.  Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.  I love car customization.

252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is less of a 'sports game' and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a 'pass' button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender.   Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a 'sports game'. Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense.   There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know.   Best.  Game.  Ever.",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"Edited as of: 21st July 2015 01:00  Pros: + Its a football/soccer game that contains rocket powered cars (added soccer because of americans). + It is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters. + (in my experience) my game seems to run at a stable 60FPS after turning off the frame limiter. + Graphics looking quite nice. + PC, PS4 cross play is possible. + Its easy to learn, Impossible to master. + Ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match. + There are a lot of friendly players in the steam community. + Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor + Full xbox 360/xbox one controller support  Cons: - PS4, PC cross parties are currently non-existant - You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time, I'm level 20/30 and I have 100% of the items - Some people have crashing issues (mainly NVIDIA DRIVER ISSUES, I run AMD so I do not have these issues myself) - Lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same - You cannot communicate to PS4 players except for a small amount of pre-determined chat commands - Voice codec is rather terrible, so advice is to use out of game communication  Middle: = Servers are pretty much sorted now, the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though = Currently no spectator system = NO PEER TO PEER, so even private matches require servers to be up = 4v4 is the limit, (some people see that as good, some as bad) = Any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executable  That is as fair as I can be to it, if I missed anything out, tell me.

252950,Rocket League,"If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)  In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots. You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^  It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.  The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game. You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.  I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.  So, hope to see some of you on the field :)",1,1

Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.  600+ logged hours later....  I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game! -------------------------------------- Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where: -The idea of the game is simple -The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.) -The skill cap is insanely high -Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of it  Rocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game. ------------------------------------ Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free! They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans! Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content! ------------------------------------ All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60!

You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2.

Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of 'Pro' and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now ♥♥♥♥, even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game.

252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).  +Great graphics and visual effects +A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches +There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting +Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers) +A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations +Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches) +Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates +You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later +Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic +It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games +Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch +As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer  +/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway  -Solo play gets pretty repetitive  Verdict: An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)  Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps.

It's a must have game, and just about anybody can play it.  I'd have to give Rocket League 9 - 1/2 out of 10. only because I don't like the match making system. I think it's a little broken to be honest. You'll have a good amount of vehicles to choose from the get go with coustom paint jobs, stickers, hats and other crazy things. (DLC's) are worth getting too. An amazing soundtrack. The music in this game gets a 10/10. It's an awesome game to just have fun with with friends or family and is well worth buying.  Edit... As of today, I can honestly say ranked matches are foocked! I'm sick to death of going in to a match with awesome team mates one game and to then go into the next match with AFK's and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.  Optimisation is great, and graphics also is fantastic. The game also has full controller support, but you can play with mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.  After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play tutorial, and finally, you will be able to play your first game on multiplayer.  In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC's. Cars from DLC's are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.  Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive types of the game. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.  As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There are ranks like PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION.  The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etcetera.   The Verdict Rocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game, do it. You will not regret. My final rating is 10/10.    If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you.",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"  Very addictive and entertaining game.    Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!  All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at Psyonix  Let me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.  Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay.   What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations.   I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community.   The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)  Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).  Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"just so you know this the first review i spent time on  pros:  Many different car choices Physics are prefect Variety of different stadiums.

MSAA, AO, depth, bloom, lights/lens, shadows and blur Cross Platforming (PC and PS4) Endless customization (Decals, boost trails, tire/rims,antennas, hats, paint finishes) Over 10 billion possible combinations  100% chance of reward when you finish a match Team balance is mostly moderate Server connection is fast with low latency, only been in one bad server or two. Crowd react to ball placement  cons:  You haven't bought this game yet so scroll back up and buy this masterpiece ",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is one of my favorite games. Why?   The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.  You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: 'Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!'   Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.   some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.  even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.  The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.  The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)  The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level 'Pro' is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)  The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your 'skill' in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.  Can i say anything more? NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too.",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.  So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.  The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master. Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE). We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours). There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not. Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired. I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).  A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the good work.  Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year.",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"Amazing game.  This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills.   This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches.   Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.  Graphics of this game is amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.  This game is honestly a 9/10.

252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.  There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.  The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay.   You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it.   Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.  Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year.   Pros: -Strong gameplay -Easy to learn, hard to master  -Plenty of car customization -No car building meta, you can customize without worry -Encoranges teamwork -Reasonable asking price($20)  Cons: -Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control     Buy At Full Price    ",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"This game doesn’t really need another “thumbs up” but I feel obligated to write a review since I spent 100+ hours playing it (by the way, that’s a lie! I only played a couple of matches!)   It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning.   So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game.   I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it.

252950,Rocket League,"To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the  only  one I've gone out of my way to review.   SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun.   Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local.     Positive   + Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay + Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating. + Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself.  + The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of. + There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.    Negative   - The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC. I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.    Conclusion   If the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now.",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.  I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.  Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent.   I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.   Graphics  are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more 'out of this world' stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The  music and sounds  in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.  The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.  For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.  Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.  ***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.

252950,Rocket League,"Amazingly fun, great for couch co-op, runs well, looks great, is relatevely cheap and has no microtransactions.",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"I love this game! Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball. The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.  Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well. But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.   Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls? How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right? Get ready for that with jet cars.",1,1

252950,Rocket League," Rocket League  is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified. If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.    What is happening in the game:",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"I don't like soccer. I don't like cars. I love Rocket League!  Even with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent  as a game . Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.  It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.  Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"A game that's doing it's job. No micro-transactions, no crappy story, no lags, no bad port / development.  I miss these kind of games - so simple and so good. 10/10",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"ABOUT THE GAME :  Rocket League is a Soccer inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Soccer with cars.  It might be the best game I've played this year so far.  PRO : - Great gameplay. - Very competitive. - Matchmaking. - Easy to pick up and a hard way to master. - Marvelous graphics. - Tons of customization. - Cool DLC's. - Cross-platform. - Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor.   CON : - You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time.   Conclusion: Rocket League is an amazing game! I highly recommend it ~ 10/10",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"This is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend:  - got game, made party, got into a casual 2v2 match - 2 a.m., window wide open - forgot - start match - 30 minutes of rage/joy/fun/screaming - someone starts bashing on my front door - figure it's downstairs neighbour - go silent, ignore - still bashing - still silent/ignore - almost breaks down my door - have to open, see who it is - see cops, jail imminent - panic - open door, act nice - cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed - start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him, I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops - cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called, but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET - almost start laughing - cop asks WTF was I doing - start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him again - he asks why I have the window open - say I totally forgot - he asks: 'What game are you playing?' - he knows. - I ask: 'Is that a serious question?' - he says: 'Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me, I've been a gamer for 15 years - what game?' - I say: 'Rocket League.' - he gives me a slight smile/nod of approval/understanding - HE KNOWS. - gives me back my ID: 'Keep the noise down, goodnight.'  911/10 would be arrested again.",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.  PROS -Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything -Very fluid -No bugs (at least I haven’t found one) -Multi-Platform -Coop and Local Coop  CONS -NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead)  -Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D) -No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I think  But really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!  ",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds",1,1
252950,Rocket League,Hey guys ^^   First this game is so so so much  fun,1,1
252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?  I have no idea.   Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. 'I hit it!' you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball  into your goal ",1,1

252950,Rocket League,"I couldn't recommend this game any more if I tried. Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.  This is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say 'one more game' over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more.    Pros:     The game looks beautiful    The physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying.    It's so addictive...like really addictive...like 'oh my god is it 5am already?' addictive.    It's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs    There is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot.    Rank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players    There's cross-play with PS4 users    It's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online    The gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skills    Cons:     It will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.    Score: 11/10 ",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"Everything is perfect about it, I wouldn't change a thing about gameplay, it's that good. Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience.   I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.  Definitely recommending it",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers.   You will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that.

252950,Rocket League,"You never know how much fun a game can be until you actually try it. Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself. So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.   The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are. That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary. Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds. OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying. That was the exact point that the hook was set.   It is not easy to score goals. You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player. You circle back and try to attack again and again. Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it. The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face.   I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds. The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key. I find myself looking forward to my next match. I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall.",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"I decided to give this game a try last night.  5 hours later, I was telling myself 'just.... 1.... more.... game....'  Needless to say, I'm hooked. It's great fun when you're on a roll, but when you go up against a team of semi-pros, it can be both frustrating and depressing. But I suppose that can go for any competitive game.",1,1
252950,Rocket League,"You have to play this game. Srsly. You can't judge it by just watching the screenshots or even videos, you have to FEEL it. The game is mad fun, gaming at its best.  And it's surprisingly deep too. It's easy to pick up, but to _really_ mastering it, it will keep you busy for a long time.  And the devs are the best.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.  Highs:  * Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.  * Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.  * Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.  * Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.  Lows:  * The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000.   * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.  * The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say '100 per week' but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.  Verdict:  If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect. I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.   Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game. And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.  Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5.   The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time. The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach. The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'. A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand. The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for. I can not possibly reccomend this more.",1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Let me give you a history lesson.  In 1989 Simcity was relased. And it was great. In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great. In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great. (Are you seeing a theme here?) In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.  Now... it gets sad. 2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing. And in 2013 brought us Sim City. And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.  Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.   By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park. Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support. In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up. Still dont have one.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.  All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.",1,0

As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them.   PROS: No EA. No EA Origin. Did I mention no EA involved? Also no EA.  -New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development. -Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point) -Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building. -Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good. -Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013) -Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.

I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.  Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.  Some of the things worth noting: - The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have. - The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy. - Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees. - Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity. - Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite. - This list just goes on and on...  The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.  Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game. :P  To sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.  Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic. Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way. Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.  This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.  First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.  The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.  You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.  The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!  Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb.   The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.  Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.  The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.  Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?  The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.  There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.  The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!  Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.  There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!   In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.  Sim City, eat your heart out.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"For 2 weeks I debated purchasing   Cities: Skylines   (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, 'screw it' and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.  In a nut shell,   Cities: Skylines   is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite.   Cities: Skylines   goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.   ---------------------------------------------------------",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.   MAP SIZE: 10/10 The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.  AI: 7/10 They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.  INTERFACE: 9/10 The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.  HOW IT RUNS: 10/10 It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own ♥♥♥♥.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .  The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.  Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher.   I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun.   This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines," Q: What I think of this game?   A: Best city builder game I played... ever... period   Q: What I don’t like about it?   A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...   Q: What about user generated content?   A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game.   I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all.   But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...   Q: Does it worth the price?   A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time.   Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?   Q: What I would love to see added to the game?   A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added.   Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.  It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.   Q: What are my advices when playing the game?   A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.  It's easy to 'cheat' the game, but it will not make it more fun.   - Watch tutorials to get some ideas  - Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it...  - Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work - Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time   Q: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?   A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU!   But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud? I am sure you are ;)   You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.  Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.  Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes. Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.  The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.  Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.  Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.  If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase.

What more is there to say?  10/10  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Edit : This is truly the best city simulation games no doubt. But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams.   And also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once.  http://imgur.com/gallery/5xz1CYa  What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once.   Other than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.  Pros: + It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it + Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it + Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads + The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler + Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system + Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city + Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime + Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop + Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback + Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools  Cons: - It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality) - The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption) - Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)  All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.  And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game. You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.  The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the 'best' city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies. For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.  Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series).   Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average.   While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.  PS:   Kill Chirpy.",1,1

These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. The developer's experience with   Cities in Motion   shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.   Cons : You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.   Verdict : ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.  The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes.  Cities: Skylines  is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about   SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition  , equaling or surpassing most innovations  SimCity '5'  brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the  Snowfall  DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming  Natural Disasters  DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.    P.S. : I haven't mentioned the Mods available through the Steam Workshop, but I just have to point out   Bryan Shannon  , a former Maxis artist who does professional-quality building Mods for  Cities: Skylines . If you have any interest in downloading Mods for this game, you should browse his collection.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.

255710,Cities: Skylines, This is the City Builder of my Dreams!,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my 'capital of capitals' - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)  Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - 'buy more of this, it will enhance the experience'. I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.  Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, 'Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?' Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!  The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!  While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.  In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.",1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,"This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.  Pros:  - Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river  - Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.).   - District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.  - Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.  - Natural resource exploitation for more income.  - Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.  - Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.  - You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.  - Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.  - Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)  Cons:  - Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.  - The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.   I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.",1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:  I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!  I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines!   Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it!   Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :D  Do I recommend this game? :D Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Bought it on release day. Within 1 hour I uninstalled....Simcity 2013, Simcity 4 and Simcity Societies. Simcity was THE game growing up and now Skylines has brought that back in tenfold. Skylines is missing three things that I would love to see.   Disasters: No not zombies or monster attacks... Disasters..a weather dynamic system such as rain, snow, tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military base  Elections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.   Major Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot. Let us bid for the olympics then have to build the buildings should we win the bid! Or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team. World events such as a Worlds Fair, or Papal Visit, or other major world events.    That's my three wishes. Maybe a developer will see at least one ;)  ",1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities: Skylines is a brand new city-building game in the vein of Simcity but built with modern sensibilities.  What is Great about this game:  - The city-building simulation is deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying to master - The agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage - A variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city - The game looks and runs beautifully - Available areas for expansion are massive (and truly huge with easy to acquire mods) - Modding and Steam Workshop support is pervasive in the game, and the modding community is prolific  What is Good about this game:  - Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)  What is Bad about this game:  - Some of the mechanics of the simulation (e.g. freight train depots, RCI) are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problems  Conclusion:  Cities: Skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games. This is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre, and everyone should at least try it once.  10.0 / 10.0",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.  Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best.   Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!",1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.           YouTube™ Video:  Cities Skyline Review with Kenuty&nbsp;,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods.   What I love: Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city.   Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.   Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game.   Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.  Not so great: DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price.   Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.  Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.  TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.",1,1

I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn't seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder 'why can't I place this here' or 'why isn't this working?'. The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.  This is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own. 9/10",1,1

But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”  So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.  I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.  Perhaps my father had a point.  Oh, an achievement unlocked!  Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.  ♥♥♥♥.  I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”  And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.  Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.  With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.  Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.  There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum.   And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful. It is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.  And no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.  Downsides: traffic isn't perfect, so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns. The devs are working on this though. Music is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/  And it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder, it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive.  Pros: +Beautiful. +Camera controls are nice. +Crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name, house and job to street light flickering before they change. +A nice selection of maps to choose from. +Has that nice classic city builder feel to it. +Looks very modern. +Day 1 mod support. +Easy to use level editor+ building creator thing. +Lots of options for obtaining resourses. +Developers seem to be active and nice. +Sounds are nice. +Rewards you for milestones +Has actual water physics (which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature).  Cons: -People are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere -Some people won't be educated even though there is a school next to them. -Some of the random 'tweets' get repetitive. -Dosen't have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before. -Because there is no tutorial I have no way or pre-planning anything that's about to come my way and I end up not being able to build things I need. -Citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didn't build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb. -Vehicles sometimes dissapear. -Bus, Metro, Trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial. -Sometimes the game won't let you build a road/build ext. because there is something in the way, but there isn't.  Overall I rate this game a 9/10 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game.",1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,"Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.  PROS -Steam Workshop Integration -Massive Cities -Enjoyable Challenge -Cities Feel Alive -Hours and Hours of Content -Great Price for Launch -Allows for Cities of All Shapes and Sizes  CONS -Traffic Needs Some Balancing -Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps) -Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to Traffic  All in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow.

It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"To anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negative, you need to know one thing: Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.  What a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of 'correct', vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.  HOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.  As you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a   moment   rather than just a nice bonus.   It can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a 'tactical retreat' as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never   meant   to have it easy, that it's   always   been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure.   Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed. Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for 'delaying' a fight) can just turn them off. Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided. There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful. While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.  Now that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.  This game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level 'WTF' moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with.   This game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like 'The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy' or 'the game is anti-fun now', but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a 'balance patch', but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be 'fun-killing'). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.  I'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.  Edit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.  Release Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release. I recommend this game 100%, and it will only get better from here, as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Here's why people are giving negative reviews: because they want everyone to be alive in their roster. Because they spent so much gold removing negative quirks and whatnot.  You WILL die in this game, whether you like it or not.  Confident that your party is able to take on a particular dungeon because they are now higher level? Nope. Not happening. Random Collector spawns and kicks your party's ♥♥♥.   This is not about RNG, it's about complacency. If you go into this game thinking that you want all your characters to be perfect and nice, rainbows and glitters everywhere, then this is not the game for you. If your party makes it through alive at the end, you should thank your ancestors.   If you are a perfectionist, this will be a very hard game for you. Your characters are essentially cannon fodder, disposable like daily contact lenses. Occasionally, you buy monthly ones, but you don't use them forever. They all have a 'shelf life'. At some point, they will become redundant or die. Nothing lasts forever.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"After a successful battle the haunting voice of the narrator of Darkest Dungeon speaks to me, stating that “overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer”. Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I’ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it’s a warning.   Darkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I’ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I’ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting.   The premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive.   There are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy’s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.  Perhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes.   Before even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.  With the game saving automatically as you go along, there’s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.  I truly love this game and can’t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"TL;DR: Community Outrage Simulator masquerading as brutal dungeon crawl.   10/10, would read a thousand angry, formerly-positive reviews about corrupt devs instead of playing a great game again.   I picked up DD over the summer, drawn in by a sociological interest in certain members of the 'community's' outrageously toxic backlash to the implementation of corpses and some other changes. Obviously, I was familiar with and intruiged by DD for its excellent art style already, but generally I am the type to wait for something to be complete before I give it a shot. However the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe you'd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them.  So thank you, dear, angry, entitled, (imo) wrong-headed (but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion, which you most certainly do, oh yes, you do...) players, for without your concentrated, delerious ire I may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last (and now this) year! For me, everything about this game is a win. The art, animation, music, sound design, narration, and general presentation are all top-notch. The prose itself is a particular highlight, as is the tongue-in-cheek brutality and general tone. To me, they really nail it.  It's hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself, because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be. DD is a procedurally-generated, turn-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty (with reference to Dark Souls) and light RPG elements and squad-management (with reference to modern X-Com).   I concede that this can be considered grindy. Dungeon crawlers are generally grindy, even great ones like Dungeon of the Endless or Legend of Grimrock. The distillation of the various aspects of the form, the massive selection of character classes, buffs, debuffs, monsters, the writing, the aesthetic, these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts. However if you don't enjoy that core to some degree or other, I don't know why you'd be considering this anyway.  Personally, I never had a problem with corpses, because I never played the game without them. Over 50+ hours, I managed to beat a number of the bosses, level characters up to the top tiers, etc, ect, and only stopped because I felt like I had gotten far enough where I was ready to play the game in a finished state, and didn't want to master too much. I also died a lot. Then I died some more. And it was fun the whole time!  As the year went on and waves of negative Steam comments continued to roll in, I felt like I was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players. As they railed against it getting harder and harder, for example, I found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier. I certainly wasn't dying as much. Maybe I was just somehow very good at it? I don't know. I still die all the time in X-Com. I don't think of myself as a master gamer or tactician.   The other critique I saw a lot, which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it, is that the devs somehow didn't care about the criticisms, that they don't listen, or that they were corrupt, or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the Early Access community, that this game was somehow some kind of scam. That's just ridiculous. There were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year, which added all kinds of content in various ways. They were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked. They were communicative, and they were clearly listening and being involved (and also making the game, for goodness sake, cmon).   Getting back briefly to the Great Corpse Outrage 2k15, for example, corpses were made a voluntary opt-out in the options menu pretty much from Backlash Ground Zero. Not that a developer has any reason to do something like that, but to then deny that it happened, or to say that they don't listen, that they're somehow scamming you, that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical, petulent, garbage argument. I can't understand what this aspect of the community actually wants, for the life of me. If the game isn't for you, you certainly don't have to play it. But a certain amount of the negativity (which borders on outright hostility) strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasn't cooked to his liking. Still, you have to admire (if not boggle at) their conviction, and their sheer verbosity of it all.  For me, this game actually sold me on the idea that Early Access could be an enjoyable, worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and I couldn't be happier with my decision to do so, and I look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer. Hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that there's a worthy, enjoyable, wonderfully-crafted experience at the center of everyone's opining.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"With all the negative reviews lamenting the changes made since the game was originally put on Early Access, I feel like I need to throw some positivity into the mix, because this game is amazing.  I've been playing on and off since it was first put on Steam, and am aware of the various changes which have been made throught each iteration of the game. To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.  The changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle.   Back before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.  TL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.  As for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.  If you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing. Still, I recommend this game to everyone I know, and it gets a big thumbs up here.",1,1

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"My hours in this game should accurately reflect my love for it. However, it is not for everyone.  If you are looking at the title then I'll make a few assumptions. You like: dungeon crawlers, leveling up classes, loots...; which you will certainly find here.  A few reasons I've spent nearly 300 hours on this game and not others should be what draws you in or dissuades you from purchasing.  - Difficulty : listed 1st for a reason that some gamers don't enjoy a game that constantly and regularly challenges you and would appreciate a more liesure gaming experience. Understandable, but that is not this title. My experience in tough games and many hours in this one and I still have points, sometimes often, that I need to retreat.  - Style : heavy-inky style gives it a dark world that perfectly fits the narrative and story. It should be said the Story is not something that explains itself very clearly. That being said, the finer details in Journals that you will find as well as the only voice in the game are done flawlessly. I could listen to this guy read a phone book and be enthralled.  - Replayability : some may find the scope of the game rather small and they wouldn't be necessarly wrong. It isn't the completion of the game that was/is my goal. I actually was reluctant to finish it because I was worried I would lose interest. They do offer a NG+ (new game plus) mode after completion which adds a couple challenging hurdles for revisiting the Estate. But, the completion isn't the goal. Doing things better, differently and getting wiser was the carrot to lure me in to the long haul.",1,1

Yeah, the rng can easily ruin your day, your party, your hero that you built up. But you know what? Sometimes life deals you a bad hand. What matters is how you handle it. How you adapt to the way life ♥♥♥♥ed you.  This is not a game that's supposed to make you feel good, or like you're good at video games, or that everything will be alright as long as you believe in the power of friendship.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler game, developed by Red Hook Studios. The game was initially released in Early access in January 2015, before leaving Early Access in January 2016.   Gameplay in Darkest Dungeon leaves you in control of a roster of heroes; you control almost every aspect of your hero’s journey throughout the game. Initially you start out with two heroes from the tutorial, and you can expand your roster by visiting the stage coach in the main game hub, here you can select from at least two heroes and have them join your group. The central hub of the game also includes various other useful locations too, such as an armour smith, weapon smith, a tavern, hospital, and many more. Each of these locations becomes key to the progression in Darkest Dungeon. The dungeon crawling side of the game is done from a side scrolling perspective, as you explore randomly generated dungeons in search for loot and treasure. The combat in this game is turn based, and very tactical. Each of your party of 5 heroes will have their own preferred location in your group and will only be able to use certain attacks based on their location too. Each of your characters has 4 active abilities they can use in a dungeon; you can swap and change them as you please in the main hub provided you have learned the skill beforehand. Your party will also contract diseases, afflictions, blights and wounds throughout their journey and most will probably even die or become useless. You can cure these by visiting the hospital in the hub, but some may render your character pointless to have around. Like the game says at the very start, you really have to make the best out of a bad situation most of the time.   Graphically, it isn’t very intense; however the art style which is presented is just wonderful. The art style is really important to this game, as it shows the essence and feel of the game perfectly. The hand drawn look to the game is one of my favourite styles in gaming at the moment, and Darkest Dungeon wets my appetite beautifully there. What is really important here though, would be the game’s user interface. As there is a lot of information needed to be able to progress successfully through the game, you are obviously going to need a clean and clear interface to show that information. The game’s tutorial at the start of the game explains a lot of it quite nicely. However a lot of the information is left for you to find out for yourself. All of your characters information, stats and equipment are all a click away, as well as your map and inventory screen. I was really happy with the interface, a few changes I would of made is to add a lot of information to show right on the screen straight away, rather than having to hover over the item, or bar – it just felt like an unneeded hoop to jump through to get the information I wanted. The ordering of the turns can be quite difficult to keep track of as well; I still have no idea how it is worked out, but I would of liked to have seen maybe a time line of the battle somewhere on the screen to make it a little easier for you to plan your attacks; maybe this was considered already but was specifically not added so the game is all that much harder, that to me is the only logical reason for not having something like that included.   The audio in Darkest Dungeon is also spot on as well. First of all, the narrator is just plain awesome. His rusty voice sent shivers down my spine at times; it is very much on par with other great narrations like Bastion and Transistor. Sound effects are all really nicely designed too; the attack noises and monster sound effects are very nice and add an extra level of immersion to your game play.  This may be the hardest video game I have ever played. The game is so unforgiving and you will get screwed over, and you will probably die from your own stupid mistakes over and over again; but that is the whole point of this game. The aim to finish the game is very hard to hit and when you do hit it, you will be able to give yourself a very well earned pat on the back, because you will have just completed a monster difficulty game. I have never actually completed lost all of my party members, there seems to be an endless supply of them in the game’s hub, so you will never “lose the game” so to speak, you can just keep retrying (all be it with lower level characters). This is one of those games where I had to spend a sufficient amount of time outside of the game, in the wiki and on forums just to give me that little extra edge over the unforgiving game play; I am not ashamed to admit and you shouldn’t be too if you have to check little bits of information out.   Due to playing the game a lot offline this week due to PC problems, a lot of my time has not been tracked, but I have put in roughly 30 hours of gameplay. I have still not finished the game, I have managed to hit max level with about 6 of my characters but I have been spending quite a while farming and grinding money for me to upgrade them more before taking on the final stages of the game. Due to the game’s randomness, the replay ability is extremely high even when you manage to finish it the once. This is a game you can easily get at least 100 hours out of without growing bored of it.   Technically I had no issues what so ever. It is definitely a game you have to use a keyboard and mouse on, just because of the amount of information you require access to. There aren’t any graphical options available sadly but it should run on just about anything as it isn’t graphically intensive. Although it isn’t exactly a technical talking point, but a nice added feature here was that you can actually turn off some of the game mechanics right out of an options menu, yes this may make the gam experience differ and may even decrease the difficulty, but I personally don’t see this as a real issue in a single player game.   My conclusion on Darkest Dungeon is that it is one of the best games to come out via the Early Access system. Even when it was first released, it was a better game than most, but now it has been fully released this year it is an absolute must play title. All other devs looking to release a game into early access really need to pay attention to these guys as it was done so perfectly and hassle free. I can easily say that it is my up most favourite roguelike game ever. The game’s regular price on Steam for £18, 99 is a good price point, there is tons of content and extremely high production values put into this game. Do not hesitate for a second more and pick this game up.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I've had Darkest Dungeon for a while now and I'm pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it. DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out. Many people say that there is no 'fail state', but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose. There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly. Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken. Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).  In short, the game has always been hard. The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits). Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations. The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism. I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.  If you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing. I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently. Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore. If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying. On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.  All in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.  Edit for clarity:  After seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.  The trinkets: I feel like they simply aren't balanced. Most of the 'Ancestral' (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help. For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters. That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit. On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.  The increased prices: Most people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game 'harder', it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the ♥♥♥. Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher. Has this specific issue bugged me? No, not really.  Curios: Honestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now. When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't. You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.  Healing: The devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets. So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements. Has this ever affected me personally? No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons. Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing? Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.  Facerolling: Do you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills? Did they ever completely faceroll everything? Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant? Yeah, same here. The game has never been 'too easy' or 'too hard', but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party. One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE. The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.  Class choices: Let's face it, some classes are just underpowered. I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit. Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster. The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable. Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle. I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept. With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter. The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well. Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh. In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet. In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to 'faceroll' things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched. If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...  For the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it. But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying 'those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing', there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD. I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.  If you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere. By the way, nice job posting my review at the top of /r/DarkestDungeon and vote brigading the thumbs downs, Reddit.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"EDIT: There has been some misunderstanding stemming from my opening lines. The key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes Darkest Dungeon unique and rewarding to play.   Darkest Dungeon isn't just another RPG, and I don't blame anyone for approaching it like one. There are plenty of on-screen cues and tips that guide the player, but for players who have played since the beginnings of Early Access, it's easy to overlook them and not start from square one. Players who are completely new to Darkest Dungeon are likely to heed these in-game suggestions and warnings at face value, and may have a better experience as a result.   I do not think the game is perfect, but it's pretty great and worth your time and money to experience.   There are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played, and I want to shed some light on why this game is actually AMAZING, and has CHANGED over time to become BETTER. There aren't going to be ANY story spoilers here, just basic mechanics--more or less just the hamlet's features and how they interact with the core gameplay.  It is a difficult game, and it is an RPG. When the going gets tough in a traditional RPG, there's usually a couple ways to deal with that: grinding monsters for money, gear, and experience, completing sidequests, and so on.  In Darkest Dungeon, you have a variety of resources at your disposal.   You have Heirlooms (used to upgrade your Hamlet facilities), you have Gold (required to use your Hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition), you have trinkets(a way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities), and you have the Heroes themselves--a renewable resource. Each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes: Resolve Level, Sanity, Quirks, Disease, Equipment, and Spells.   Here's the part where people go wrong: they try to min-max, they try to save their heroes, they'll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out. This game restricts your resources far too hard for that, and makes your gains from doing so miniscule--you do make a profit, but its tiny and takes a long time. The profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost non-existent, and players see this as being the 'grindfest' as they slowly approach the endgame, often trying to circumvent this game's difficult mechanics (popular Steam guides are guilty of this!) by 'grinding it out,' using strategies such as suicide-gold runs (which are a time sink in and of themselves, adding to the grind illusion)...  Those narrow margins of profit? The seemingly unending grind? Its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play, and those players aren't adjusting their gameplay.   Progression through this game's intense difficulty isn't made by grinding out the perfect heroes, its by taking what you have and going for it. You're going to fail. You're going to lose heroes. You're going to hit brickwalls. But you're going to learn the absolute limits of every hero, the absolute limits of your style of play, and you'll push those limits. Your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly, taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down.  Brute-forcing a grind through the game is technically possible. But you shouldn't do it.  This game wants you to face its depths head-on, and as soon as you do, it drags you further down and constricts you even more.  When you finally get it though--when you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the game--there is very little more rewarding. It doesn't happen because you grind. It doesn't happen because you followed a strategy--it happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"This game rewards the chicken-hearted. Stubbornly trying to finish a dungeon that's gone badly from the start leads to a deathmarch.  This game rewards the detail-minded. Did you remember to unequip your trinkets? Did you re-equip them? Did you check to see if that monster is going to easily resist that attack? Dude, did you even make a provisions checklist?  This game rewards the heartless. Sometimes the best thing to do with a syphilic, boozed-up 'hero' with a bad case of nerves is to fire her. Sometimes deciding to let her die of a heart attack gets you a shiny.  This game rewards the persistent. Not giving up after a humiliating party wipe is more of a key to success than flashes of tactical brilliance. Completing the game in less than 99 weeks (each week is a dungeon run that takes up to half an hour) is considered fast and gets you an achievement.  This game rewards the flexible. Sometimes you don't have a lot of choices. Your healers are all too diseased and crazy this week. Your tank went AWOL, and your barbarian needs to have a pesky trait removed. Can you scrape together a viable party? Or maybe your tactics went well only up to a point. Will you come up with new ones or will you pack it in, mumbling bitterly about the unfairness of it all?  It's not for everybody.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"A truly fantastic game with a criminally low review rating. This stems from the game having changed a fair bit since early access, but all the changes have been positive. Making the game less exploitable is a good thing, people! The other complaints I hear are usually 'The RNG is too severe! No skill!' Which is entirely untrue. All RNG in Darkest Dungeon can be avoided by careful planning and thought. On my second run through the game, I survived 100 weeks without a single death or a single quest failure and with only one resolve check encountered. (Edit: I've now finished the game twice consecutively with no deaths!)  Pros! - Highly addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back for more - Tons of replayability as no run through the game is the same - Very strategic combat; party compositions, trinket speccing, synergies... the list goes on - Beautiful in every sense. Stunning art-style, effective animation, fantastic soundtrack - Diverse and varied characters make for a lot of experimentation and fun - Fair difficulty curve, challenging the whole way with difficult but achieveable boss fights at the end - Lots of content for the price - Unique regions to explore with thematic enemies and procedurally generated dungeons - Perfectly managed stress and health systems with intriguing 'Death's Door' and 'Resolve Check' mechanics to keep you on your toes in and out of combat - Wayne June's narration is golden. It sets the Lovecraftian atmosphere perfectly and oozes quality with such sophisticated, verbose vocabulary - Town Events make things more varied in the Hamlet (For better and occasionally for worse!) - Somewhat frequent updates with new heroes, new content, bug-fixes, and fine-tuned mechanics  Cons - A little beginner unfriendly in some places like cluttered tooltips, lack of game-mechanic introduction, etc - The fact it's not in your game library! Absolutely criminal!  There's plenty more praise I could sing this game but I should stop now. This game captivated me and I fell deeply in love with it. I hope other people do too after reading this review!",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,Not enough stress at home or work? Play this game and you'll never be happy again!!,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"You should already know: it's a rogue-like dungeon crawler with classes you recruit and send on dungeon crawls.  Now that the game is officially released and post-release-patched, here is a new review:  The game is fantastic. The different classes and abilities mean you can play two runs in a row with totally different battle play styles. The narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton.  The concept works really well. Rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits 'money run' or 'artifact run' into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression.   The balance is (IMO) really good. You are low on things and people for a long time, by design. Your dungeon crawlers die a lot, by design. But it's all in service of the theme, and as you rebuild and get better everything else gets better too.   Also, importantly, they have added a lot of options to change the gameplay to make it easier by toning down or eliminating various types of difficulty. I find the default difficulty fantastic but I'm also a big believer in letting people choose to turn off things they dislike.   I paid $20 for this the first week it was on Steam, and played it for over 100 hours while it was still in Early Access. Now that the final game is out and there are new classes and areas and story content that I've never seen, I feel confidant that I will get another 100 hours. As some one who never pays full price for a game, this is a game I bought at full price and I'm glad I did.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®, TL;DR? See Conclusion,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"If you were my friend, on a budget, and asking for my Darkest Dungeon review I would say: Don't buy this game.  It took me a while (30hrs) to decide how I really and truly felt about Darkest Dungeon. If you are looking to buy this game then you are probably like me, a fan of difficult games (Dark Souls comes to mind). Let me go ahead and give you the warning that I feel I didn't get from looking at reviews...this game is not difficult in a way that is remotely satsifying.  When I play a difficult game I want to feel something after a tough battle. I want to feel like I really earned my sword, my armor, my loot, my gold. I want to feel like all the progress I've made is deserved, because I learned from my mistakes and overcame my ignorance of the world's mechanics. At some point I want to feel successful, and look down upon this horrific world that I've made my way in and say, 'Heck yeah this place is scary, but I have at last become one of those scary things in it.'  Darkest Dungeon is not that game. (Spoilers)  1a) Stress Damage (Too High): Stress damage sounds cool right? Very Lovecraftian. But the problem here is that you are already walking such a razor thin margin of success that all you need is for your main damage dealer to go insane to wipe the party. Each character has about 100pts of stress they can take before giving in to madness...which really isn't much when enemies do anywhere from 15-20pts of stress damage per attack.   1b) Immersion Breaking: There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of logic to what causes stress or how much you take. Seeing a reanimated corpse shambling towards me would stress me out more than getting splashed with a cup full of blood...especially if I am a Crusader, Leper, or Highwayman who is...probably used to being splashed with blood.  2a) Trinkets: I want to say that the items you use to 'boost' your characters stats are worthless. That isn't true; it's just that they are nearly worthless. Yes you can find the rares, and you can get the ancients but the drawbacks are so significant that I almost never wanted to equip them. A bracer that gives +25 damage? Yes please! But it also gives +20% stress damage...when I'm already taking 20 stress a hit?  2b) After playing Darkest Dungeon for 30hrs I have yet to find a single piece of loot that made me happy. Not a single one and for the life of me I can't understand why the developers went with such a harsh Catch-22 for all these items. If I don't care about finding gear to boost up my characters then why am I even delving into these dungeons?   3a) The story. 30hrs in and I am tired of hearing the narrator as he constantly sputter 12-letter words ripped directly from the pages of your favorite Lovecraftian horror story. Excusing that, my problem with the story is that the narrator explains everything in the intro scene. Quite literally. As you delve through the dungeon and find notebook pages you slowly come to the realization that they do not reveal anything new.  3b) Immersion Breaking: I start to ask myself...what in the world am I doing down here? Maggots can apparently appear from thin air so it's not like I'm going to live in this hellhole after I clear all the monsters and bandits out. My ancestor is hecka dead so...I'm not here to save anyone. ...Why am I sending all these people to die again? I mean...It's not for money. Only people making money in this game are my vassals (tavern owner, abbey, guild, blacksmith) who, setting aside the fact that they are charging me straight out the nose for things, apparently require I give them dozens of family portraits and land deeds in order to fulfill the orders that I just paid (and continue to pay) them for.  4a) The Bosses: Back to Dark Souls 2 for a second. One of the most frustrating fights for me was the gargoyles in the belltower. More than almost any other fight it felt unfair, as you get swamped from every direction, skewered, and suffer multiple deaths. But eventually you get it. You learn the pattern, match it to your fighting style, and succeed. There is none of that here. What seemed interesting and innovative to me in Darkest Dungeon was the number of classes and the combination of parties you could make. But gradually you realize that some of the classes are truly worthless (Antiquarian comes to mind) and even worse, that the game requires that you bring certain classes to certain dungeons. It curtails the way that you play and I am not at all a fan of paying money for a game only to have it pretty much micromanage my fun.   4b) Immersion Breaking: The Wizened Hag. After fighting six different room battles I finally come upon the hag only to discover...she sits in the back row behind an unbreakable cooking pot and cannot be moved. Literally...cannot be moved. So why in the world would you give me so many characters and abilites that change the enemies battle positions? Why give me a power and then say, 'No, not here where it might be used best.' After the Wizened Hag fight (which I narrowly won thanks to a Crusader with Spear of Light) I looked up tactics for every single boss on the wiki, something I would normally be ashamed to do on my first playthrough of any game. Why? Because I'm not about to lose 4 to 5 hours of gameplay and grinding because Darkest Dungeon in unfair. Not difficult, but actually just unfair.   5a) Darkest Dungeon is simply unfair. Not in a sense of 'It's okay, I can still get through this limping through the dungeon' kind of unfair, but in a 'Hey, your characters are going to die today, and that's all there is to it.' Kind of unfair. I have had a geared up team stunlocked to death by spiders in a hallway. I sat for four turns (all the spiders go, all my team recovers from stun = 1 turn) while the spiders stunned, marked, and killed my team. I have had enemies focus down my team one by one, from the healer in postion 4 to the tank in postion 1. Not with damage, but with stress, so that my characters pass instead of taking their turns and get picked apart. I have walked into a hallway and gotten surprised at 90 light, then walked into a room and gotten surprised at 80 light, and then gotten surprised leaving that room into another hallway at 76 light. I have watched as characters on my team repeatedly miss hitting the enemy 3 times in a row despite having no debuffs at all, and then watched as enemies debuffed to detract from accuracy, speed, and damage, proceed to get a critical hit, every hit, that takes my characters to deaths door and then the grave.   6a) These situations are common, which brings me to my last point. The game is unfair, so there isn't a real reason to get attached to your characters. So... If you aren't here to take your home back, and you aren't here to save your ancestor, and you aren't here to become fabulously wealthy, and you aren't here to lead a team of chosen warriors through hell and back...what is the point of playing Darkest Dungeon?   I ask this knowing that there isn't one.   *****EDIT 5/21/2016 At this point in time only 0.9% of people who have purchased Darkest Dungeon have beaten the game on normal. (* 0.9% is from the Global achievement stats which lists by percentage of all players)",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"TL DR: A fascinating game turns into a boring grindfest, skip or wait for rebalance patch --------------------------------------------------  ...And it's a pity, cause I really like this game! The combat is awesome and diverse, the dark atmosphere is perfect, the random nature of the game makes the dungeon runs very fun every single time - overall, this is a great game, let down by two major factors:  1) The Catch-22 equipment upgrades, caused by the fact that your characters level far faster than you generate the necessary money for their upgrades.  so, let's say you've leveled four of your characters from level four to level five. There's a game mechanic where high level characters will refuse to go to low level dungeons (which are beneath their dignity).  So, the four champions can only do level 5 dungeons. But you can't beat a level 5 dungeon without the equipment upgrades. But equipment upgrades costs money. But to get the money you need to beat the level 5 dungeon. But the champions cannot beat it!  So to solve it, you get a B-team doing the dungeons as well, but then you need to spend money on the B-team! The only solution is to recruit new characters (recruiting level 0 characters is free) and duing suicide runs with them, which is extremely grindy and boring.  But this is nothing compared to...  2) The Endgame  Basically, once your team of four best characters of the highest level, the finest characters, goes into the first level of the final dungeon and beats it... They can never go there again! So you level four more best characters for level two of the dungeon. And they also can't go there again! So you do it again for level three, and level four.  Assuming no one dies (which is impossible), this is 16 CHARACTERS you need to level up to level 6!  This is the worst game restriction I've ever seen, I don't even know what to compare it with - it's like in Skyrim you would have to start a new character from scratch for every single boss fight.  And for people saying 'this is hardcore' - no, this is not hardcore, stupid restrictions to artifically prolong the game's life by making you do a ton of unnesessary work and grindfest are not hardcore!  With these two factors, I cannot recommend the game in its current state.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I’m awful at writing methodical, comprehensive reviews, so I’ll stick to bullet points like a basic ♥♥♥♥♥.    Presentation   Flawless. The gritty comic book style creates for an intense and immersive atmosphere befitting of lovecraft's literary style.     Gameplay   Hard to learn, harder to master. The game’s mechanics are complex and not always well explained. This can be frustrating at times, particularly when your band of heroes is steamrolled by a boss you’ve never encountered, simply because you didn’t know what to expect. I recommend playing the game for a few hours, beating a few bosses, then skimming the wiki so you can better understand the in-depth mechanics of the game’s RNG. Nonetheless, its amazingly fun and satisfying.    Music   Perfect. Stuart Chatwood did an amazing job on the soundtrack. The music is also well implemented with the game mechanic of light, making for some intense battles where you feel like a true badass.    Voice Acting   There’s only one voice actor, Wayne June, and yet his performance easily lends to 50% of Darkest Dungeon’s enjoyability. His succulent voice invades my ears like some obscure lovecraftian alien lifeform.    Dialogue   While I love June’s lines and delivery, my one complaint with the entire game is that around the end of my first playthrough, I found myself tired of the repetitive lines from the characters and Ancestor. One can only hear the “Remind yourself…” line so many times before it loses its majesty.    In short   I absolutely love The Darkest Dungeon. It was worth every penny and more. It even got me interested in Lovecraft’s stories. Given the new DLC coming in early 2017, I can’t see any better time to pick up Darkest Dungeon. Is rly gud.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"It's the Summer Sales, I decide to write something to let more people experience the cool feeling of exploring dungeons, fighting all kinds of monsters  and mind breaking by those hideous creature . In brief, it is a roguelike plus simulation game. In fact, the player is running a small hamlet, which was called... Hamlet of course. This villiage is surrouded by different 'residential area', where different styles of 'kind' neighbours live. The task is simple, recruit your 'villains' to 'plunder' those 'neighborhoods', then use the 'loot' to reinforce your 'villain party', and eventually kill the boss of those 'neighbor', and lead your hamlet to the 'brightest' world.   I've never been so close to the Death…",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"An excellent twist on the turn-based dungeon crawler, Darkest Dingeon is a great game. Part management sim, part dungeon crawler, the game has you manage a collection of dungeon diving RPG heroes like in many similar games. The difference is that your warriors are not singularly important. If you lose a favored hero the game doesn't reload from a save, or let you restart the dungeon. That hero is gone, and someone else will need to take his place. Thus it's to your advantage to maintain a stable of heroes instead of that one party of your favorites (a la XCOM).  Added to that your heroes aren't delving into high fantasy dungeonscapes where good guys always win. Their journeys pit them against eldritch horrors that can drive them mad or reduce them to catatonic helplessness. The cumulative affects of this end up being worse than mere death. This is where the management part of the game comes into play. Your heroes need some time for R&amp;R to help them forget the horrors of the deep, and for that you maintain and upgrade a small town where they can pray to the gods for strength or drown their sorrows in the tavern.  In this game a cool idea meets excellent execution. The art style is very cool, while simultaneously representing the grim, Cthulu aesthetic. Couple that with the narration, smooth controls, and a UI that leaves all the important info readily available to you while simultaneously leaving the screen uncluttered so you can appreciate the dark beauty of the game. The worst criticism that I can muster is that the music is forgettable. Like, I have three hours in game as I write this, and I can't remember what it sounds like.  Even with all that, a game that relies on combat so heavily could still fail if that combat is poorly done and otherwise not fun. Darkest Dungeon has a combat system that's deep enough to offer many choices while not overwhelming you or forcing you to focus on min/maxing to get by.  This game is amazing. My only regret about my purchase is that I didn't find it earlier.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Outdated review. Havent played it before its release. So, please, take this review with a grain of salt.  It really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now. Not because it is hard or unfair sometimes (now many more times after the last update). I actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time. So you can see im not one of 'i lost 50 characters, this game is bad'. The problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies, not to mention that there is little reward.    I cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new heroes, get lucky with some quirks, lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff. When in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk, i stopped caring for them. Why would i care for a vestal with higher hp, dodge and speed if she can lose it all in a single turn? Why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them? What is the point of making a character unique? There is none, period. The devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks (note, they didnt get any single new attack. Their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now.) while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics.   'Oh, there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher'. Well, that's exactly when they start murdering the freedom. I dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like. What is the point of getting new trinkets, try nem combinations of trinkets? None. That's that. I dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could. FYI, i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run. That is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game. And the character is very fragile. No high hp, no way to buff his survival. Nothing. GHuess what, engage in a combat, 2 round later, his dodge was greatly decreased. And that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party, you can imagine how 'open' the other 3 were. Im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well.   It sound terrible, right? But, hey, cant you buff your characters? Yes, you can. But here is the thing, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BUFF SKILL YOU CANT MATCH THE ENEMY'S DEBUFF. Simply as that. I think the aoe debuff i suffered is -10 for stack. and that for low level characters (you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons). The highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9. Exactly, 9, from a high level character. And a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values. Nevertheless, even if the debuffs werent so severe, i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff. Simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you. And in this rng based rpg(dont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent. Even with top characters and trinkets, you could face some really bad situations) that can be very, very dangerous.   But, hey, that is not over yet. Ohh, you may start thinking 'What, this is worse than it already is?'... And the answer is: yes. Here's the thing, now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat. That includes buffing and healing your party. Exactly, it includes it. And it can be even worse than that. I was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy, used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived. Oh, i was penalized because the guy survived. No, he didnt attack me or something. I got a stress attack (stress are almost a second health bar in this game. If you let it go too high... You might face serious, serious problems. In some extreme cases, your character dies). I gave up at that point. I was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right. What is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else you're wasting turns? I dont feel like it anymore, dont want to try new strategies, specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to 'waste time' taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die.   I have to write more about the trinkets as well, for newcomers, since they are one of the main rewards of the quests. A great number of them, include the most rare ones, 'ancestral trinkets', are useless or unworthy. Really, the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other 'not so rare' trinkets. The same rule aplies to the 'Very rare' trinkets, which is one tier below. This happens because all of them have some drawbacks (- speed, -dodge) that make them less worth to use. And with the new patch, more of them became even more useless, which ends with the game being less rewarding. And, with all the bs the devs put now, there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket.   The another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless. You use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments (you can only get new armor and weapon this way). And you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group. Now, the devs got a brilliant idea: let's make the itens you buy limited. Yay. It's not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100% prepared for everything and you want the rewards... Well, you can use gold to buy trinkets as well, but the majority of them are useless. So... No reason anymore to have tons of gold. And even less reason to play this game.    Well, that is why i gave up with this patch. Not willing to try finding better trinkets, that are so few. The majority of them you may not use EVER. And that list may have just got bigger since now you'll have to focus on debuff res. Dont feel like trying to make builds for some places. Hero that gets more attacks, hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time i waste creating one completly unrewarded. And the freedom i had to try new party compositions, new strategies, finding sinergy with skills is vanished, since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me. cant go with a party that is 'slow but safe'. Have to go with higher risk. But, like i said many times, no reward for me.   I really enjoyed this game, i really did. even in times i felt it was unfair, i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them. Now, since the best the devs have done to 'rise the challenge' is simply make it even more luck based than ever, i gave up. They crossed the line of hard but rewarding to luck and unrewarding. And i cant feel any longer the will to play it, praying that my group gets luck, that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight. That isnt skill reliable. Whoever think it is is completly mistaken. Gonna miss the art, music, dialogue and lore from this game. But, unless the devs do something about this, i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube. Far more enjoyable for me and less stressful",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Excellent turn based dungeon crawler with a punishing difficulty and a great oppressive atmosphere. - Stylish, detailed 2D art style. - H. P.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"A flawed but fun dungeon crawler with a fantastic aesthetic theme and an emphasis on tactical combat and roster management.  Darkest Dungeon is a very streamlined gameplay experience. The exploration segments have a fairly small number of decision points. Characters have a limited number of moves to select from in combat, and character building is limited to a small number of skill and item choices. On the one hand, the game lacks somewhat for depth as a result of this aggressive minimalism. On the other hand, it's freed of a lot of pointless micromanagement that plagues more detailed games. The concept is that you have a smaller number of more meaningful decisions to make, although I can't say the execution is without its flaws--too many decisions are plagued by trap options, leaving the player with fewer real choices than they should have. It's still fun, but has room to improve.  Generally, though, the tactical elements are pretty decent. There is a large element of randomness, but the game does a good job of providing tools to mitigate risks. Careful and thoughtful play is consistently rewarded, but there is a strong risk/reward element to the gameplay, so if you play fast and loose you can still accomplish amazing things if you're lucky--or die horribly if you're not.   The highlight of the game is definitely the aesthetics. The art direction is awesome, the voice work is superb, and the story (while sparse) is surprisingly good. The tactile feel of combat is extremely enjoyable. The game's themes and motifs are woven throughout the art, story, and gameplay in a really satisfying and cohesive way. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is executed brilliantly. Most dungeon crawlers have the bare minimum of story necessary to explain why the player is off to kill monsters and collect loot, so getting an interesting narrative out of the ending sequence was a pleasant surprise. It's a very well done piece of horror.  That does bring us to the elephant in the room: the grind. Dungeon crawlers generally tend to be largely about grinding when you get down to it, and Darkest Dungeon is not really an exception. It's got 14 classes to play with and heavily encourages (eventually outright forces) you to use more than 4 characters, so there's enough diversity in the roster to keep gameplay somewhat fresh and interesting. And the difficulty curve is well done, with enemies picking up new tricks to challenge you throughout the game. Even so, there are points where the game ends up dragging. A full campaign is likely to take 30-40+ hours, which is a huge time commitment for a relatively simple game. The game could really have been shaved down by 5 or 10 hours without really losing anything.   In general, I would recommend Darkest Dungeon if... ...you want to play a streamlined version of old school dungeon crawlers with a major roster management component. ...you'd like to see a game pull off a gritty gothic horror theme and turn classic RPG archetypes on their head. ...you enjoy tactical combat optimization that doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.  On the other hand, you may consider staying away if... ...you get very attached to your characters in RPGs and hate when bad things happen to them. ...you enjoy micromanagement and having control over a lot of fine details. ...you're a fan of traditional heroic fantasy narratives and love seeing the good guys win.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon is a 2d turn-based dungeon crawler, created by Red Hook Studios.  Upon starting the game you are greeted with the news that a dear estranged relative of yours has been up to some pretty bad stuff and essentially leaves you to clean up his mess. The mess in question being the multitude of ghouls, horrors and other assorted ne’er-do-wells that now inhabit the family manor and the hamlet that surrounds it. This is the premise of Darkest Dungeon and it works as well as any other to start our adventure.  The bulk of the game revolves around leading a group of four characters through an assortment of randomly generated dungeons and doing battle with the creatures that inhabit them. Characters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them. For instance some characters will do better on the front line while others will thrive at the back of the group. Setting up your group is key to a successful endeavour. This is where the games hub comes into play.  The Hamlet is a small group of shops and buildings that acts as the games main hub. From here you are able to make use of a wide variety of amenities as you decide which heroes to send out on their next adventure and with what supplies to pack. New heroes are able to be recruited from the stage coach, armour and weapons upgraded at the blacksmith, diseases and quirks cured at the sanatorium as well as many other services being available for the right price. This includes spending money to reduce the effect of one of the games main mechanics - Stress.  Stress is an in-game measurement of a particular hero's mental state, a counter that goes from 0 to 200. If the hero's stress reaches 100 they will gain an affliction or have a chance to become virtuous. While a virtuous hero will only benefit your team with buffs and stress reduction. An afflicted hero has the complete opposite effect, increasing the stress of those around them and sometimes actively putting themselves in danger or ignoring your command completely. If your stress becomes too high, your hero is at risk of a heart attack which may kill them outright. This may be compounded by the games quirk system, where in certain situations a hero will develop a positive or negative quirk that will affect how they act, or how you must treat them. These can range from increased stress gain to a compulsive need to examine every item you come across and many more.   When it comes to presentation, Darkest Dungeon gets full points. The gothic 2d art style oozes personality without being overly busy or confusing and a good use of depth of field stops the game from feeling flat. The interface is incredibly well designed and remains simple, despite the amount of information housed within. There are a few changes I would make to make viewing information a little easier but overall the interface does what it sets out to do very well. The graphic style of Darkest Dungeon conveys the mood of the game perfectly and only strengthens its theme, ESPECIALY when paired with the terrific audio design and the phenomenal voice acting of the narrator.  The Audio design in this game is on another level when stacked up against its peers. as the light fades so too does the music’s simple nature, giving way to an erratic tune that becomes more maddening the more you venture forth, the weighty sounds of attacks as your group goes toe to toe with all manner of horrors, and of course the absolutely shiver inducing tones of the loquacious narrator as he pontificates about his 'Venerable house' and the 'arcades of antiquity'.  All of these elements come together to make Darkest Dungeon and absolutely unforgettable experience. the feeling of felling an enemy with a perfect strategy leaves you in awe of yourself as a brilliant tactician while other times becoming absolutely downtrodden as you lose the hero you've been cultivating for so very long. Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of what you are given and sometimes when life gives you lemons, well I hope you like lemons.  Overall my Experience with Darkest Dungeon has been incredibly satisfying, having put 40 hours into the game I can see that I am in fact not even close to finishing, nor do I feel the fatigue that I usually would after playing most any other game for such a long period of time. When I first saw it in early access I was itching to play it, but decided to hold off and wait until the developers were confident enough to say that it was a finished product, and I am so glad that I did.    If you are a fan of X-Com, or don’t mind a bit of punishment to get true satisfaction out of your gaming experience then I don't have any problem telling you that   Darkest Dungeon is a  MUST PLAY.      If you enjoyed this review consider leaving a thumbs up, or if you have some constructive feedback to leave, feel free to comment.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon is a game that shows you how dangerous and foolhardy it is to grab a torch and go down into dark depths to face the beings who reside there.  And I love it, every step I take.  Darkest Dungeon is a challenging dungeon crawler where your characters must combat stress (read: Sanity) as well as the beasties that lie in the darkness as they search for fame, fortune and glory. It really takes heavy cues from H.P. Lovecraft on how man was not meant to see what lies just beyond the torchlight.  It uses a turn based system and RPG elements as well as some cues taken from roguelike games, such as permadeath. The game rewards quick thinking in a bad situation and preparation and priorities can truly determine weather your party comes out from the caves alive, or are ripped to shreds by nameless horrors.  The Art style is phenomenal and you'd be hard pressed to find a indie game with such evocative soundtracks and voiceover. The narrator makes you feel the success of a critical hit and heartache of a fatal blow. You grow attached to your party members just to see them die from a poor decision. Some people may cry that the computer can pull these amazing succession of criticals leaving your characters ripe for slaughter next turn, but I've found that if you prepped correctly, prioritized your healing, and use status effects (like bleed and blight) to your advantage, you'll make it by the skin of you teeth and escape the dungeon.  In this game, you gotta know when to call it quits and leave the dungeon with what loot you can carry. It's ok to run and come back another day with a stronger party and better supplies then to lose a character you've upgraded significantly. And I love that about this game. In H.P. Lovecraft's stories, it is rarely a happy ending and this game holds to those themes tightly.  In the end, I would recommend this game, but only to those that have the patience and understanding of the mindset you have to have when facing the terrors of the abyss. If you go in foolhardy, you'll end up simply making more loot for the party that comes in after, as they pillage the nameless corpse of another failed adventurer.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Early access? What early access? This game is amazing as it is... oh, man, I can't even begin to imagine what will it look like when finished!  I bought the game during the summer sale 2 days ago and I easily clocked in close to 17 hours already, and that is already telling, don't you think? But let's not get ahead of myself. As usual, I will take a look at the good and the bad. This review is as of build 9007, with the man at arms and the arbalest included, along with the new bosses.  The Good:  1. Ironman - this game is for true rogue-like genre fans, the ones that do not whine and complain in the face of adversity and overwhelming odds, but for ones who seek options and avenues of advancement to combat this adversity. 2. Rogue-like at its best - you never know what the game will offer you. You need to cope with the resources at your disposal. For example, you may be forced into weeks and weeks of hardships simply because the game won't pity you enough to give you another Vestal or Occultist character, but instead shower you with tanks and pitiful healers. 3. Procedurally generated dungeons - while you could try to assume and predict, based on the area you chose to explore, layouts they are still largely random, so you need to plan ahead big time. Fight or flee has never been a bigger wrench of a choice before.Or that What if... queston on the back of your mind... 4. Memorable stories - the game creates stories on its own, for example, how you got wiped twice, forced into meager runs but managed to get back on your feet and actually complete all the objectives, or, say, how you were forced into a 4 highwayman run cause you had nothing else to use, or, how your cleric went crazy and abusive and started britching(:P) about anything others do, which tunred into an avalanche of abusive stressed out individuals who care not about each other? Those things are in the game. This is one of the few games that makes you go to the forums or post a status about what happened just to vent off or share with your friends. 5. Various missions - every time you complete a mission you get a different set of consequential encounters for you to choose, all of them with various objectives and varying rewards. 6. Bosses - there are a number of bosses in the game, each one with different mechanics, meaning you need to bleed, boil and hurt till you learn what the boss does best and how to best combat him/her... it. 7. Your very own mini-village for you to develop as you see fit. Will you neglect armor and weapons for the sake of more skills and buffs during camping? Will you choose to be skilled and better equipped and protected, but suffer everything the RNGesus throws at you cause you didnt upgrade the amount of new heroes who want to join you and the means of reducing stress through the abbey or the tavern? All up to you, and my, it is a big deal to select a good path of advancement. This alone creates memorable stories to post and share. 8. Varying areas each with its own enemies, expectations, and bosses. 9. The Light system, which alone makes for very interesting gameplay. More stress, but more loot, a normal run, or a safer run with less loot but little stress and lots of happy characters? Up to you! 10. Wonderful level progression system with a set number of skills per character and quirks you gain for completing dungeons or various other conditions. 11. Being dark and moody, making you crigne when something happens - it only enhances the experience. 12. Value for the money - I like judging my game hours like 1 for 2, or 1 for 3 for bigger games. So, for every 1 euro I pay I expect 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can tell you, I could do 10 times the price I paid for this game. 13. I have come back to the game since the review and I was absolutely baffled by the amount of content the devs actually dumped in. Well done, people. Let's go Darkest Dungeoning again!  The Bad: 1. Early access - yeah, many features are still missing, even if the game is great as it is. 2. Ironman - the game is extremely punishing, sometimes to the point of frustration. Some enemies can crit you out and kill a character while you're gaping at the screen with a 'holy crap' ready to roll out of your mouth. 3. You get to work with what you're given - you may find yourself sorely lacking in resources, passable heroes, meager parties, and worse. 4. Cheesing out - the game can be cheesed out to make more money and save yourself from a dire situation, or to win a mission somehow. 5. There is a stupid caretaker that may occupy the only freaking place where your most valuable character has to go to relieve stress. 6. Dungeon layouts may completely foil your plans. 7. Wipes and bad stuations - yeah, it can happen, especially while you still dont know what you're doing and what each thing does. 8. Character balance - characters are not perfectly balanced as of yet. Then again, this game being a rogue-like, dont mind having an underdog in my party just because I dont have anything else to use.  Conclusion: BUY THIS GAME - simple as that. You will spend lots of gameplay hours on it in its early access - I would say 30+ to complete all the caretaker's goals, and lots more when the game gets fully released. That being said, while I am a tad generous with the play time for a single run, I have 2 separate play-throughs (as I wanted to see the game from 2 different standpoints) and I can easily say that those play-throughs are as different as the sun and the moon. This is downright amazing, and I sure as hell hope they will continue adding content this way. There are still 2 more areas to unlock in the future, and they are surely going to be amazing.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"What can I add to some of the great reviews available on this game?  Well, nothing really but the message to all potential buyers that here is one of those games that really satisfies in every aspect of gaming.  I found the difficulty a breaking point at first but once I kept at it and learned more and more about the games features (and there are many!!) it became more and more addictive.  Lead a party of different warriors into the locations and you will have to deal with all their flawed character traits (they all have some traits to discover that can seriously impact their performance) and rising fear (up till heartattack level) plus fight enemies in turnbased combat.   Luckily you have numerous ways to keep those things in check if prepared well and used well. Potions, bandages, spells and weapon upgades will all be available once you level up and when you're back in town there's all those buildings where you can restore the health, weapons and fear or morale issues. (visit a tavern, gamble away or sneak to a brothel, find blessings and conquer fear in the monastery)  This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  The whole game is drenched in atmosphere, the art work is sublime and dark, there are no bugs that I have found and the music is perfectly suited for some dangerous adventuring to find out the curse of the manor.  Like I said it takes some time to get to know all the possibilities but that only feels more satisfying once you master those.  This is a game that every lover of turnbased RPG's should have... no doubt about it!!",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I want to start by saying I had already played this game in the past, before there were even secondary bosses or a Cove area, and I did so for very, very long. it was an intensely fun and rewarding experience, and it absolutely made me think it would be money well spent to acquire it for myself when it was finished. Hell, I'd have payed twice its price tag, to get a completed game which was that enjoyable.  I received it as a gift from a friend recently and was positively overjoyed, I could not wait to come back and see all that was added in this past half year. I created a new save file, started playing... and despaired. But I decided to keep playing, and to not stop playing until I had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer.  So it is now, after over 30 hours of gameplay time, that I want to write this review and say that I do NOT, in any way or form, recommend this game as it currently is. It is no longer the game I played back then. It has changed into something that is barely recognizable; it -is- technically the same game, but it most definitely does not feel the same. And it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment.  I've read many bits and pieces of (sometimes conflicting) information as to why this happened, namely:  -A highly-vocal group of 'fans' steering this game into its sad current state -Developers which have a very particular vision for this game, and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could afford  So before I get into any details, I want to make this clear: I am not familiar to any such forum drama, I do not know who holds the blame, and I have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today. The one thing I know for certain is: it did change. Badly.  This game is now unquestionably an anti-fun game. By 'anti-fun' I don't mean overly hard, I don't mean overly grindy, I don't mean overly complex. I mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it. Practically all enjoyment is gone, all progression feels meaningless for the most part, all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever.  Chief among the worst offenders are two mechanics: corpses and heart attacks. And yes, I know you can turn corpses off, but then we are not playing the game 'the way it's meant to be played', we are not experiencing all it has to offer. And so, to elaborate:   Heart attacks - having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before, in a GOOD way. It was a challenge to be overcome, it was an entertaining encumbrance. That lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough, and you'd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves, refusing heals, shuffling about, acting on their own... and a lone hero who passed the Virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition. It was a predicament, it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all, but it was FUN.  This is not the case anymore. Stress accumulation is now roughly 2-3x higher than it once was, everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously. And it doesn't stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal, while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable. No, now it NEVER stops, and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating, training, and equipping the heroes that WILL inevitably die from it at some point. You used to be able to bring a mildly-stressed hero on an expedition; doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well, and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will fail  I will not even touch with a 10-foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right, and will simply leave it at: This is not fun. This is not acceptable, even. It is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress, something you can't effectively heal from, is an ever-present threat of almost instant death, which, thanks to this game's unforgiving RNG and mechanics, is VERY usually the same as instant death. Heart attacks could maybe, -maybe- be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress. And this is still a VERY big maybe. But as it is, it is undeniably an anti-fun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control.  -------------------  Corpses - This is by far the worst offender of the two, and that's without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone, butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach. This mechanic kills the utility of certain classes, artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which, for the most part, are otherwise generally useless, and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason. Enemies are -never- inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them, and even then, most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction. It is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game, causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target that's out of reach, thus taking more damage and stress for, again, -no reason whatsoever-.  But I want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic. Corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isn't a critical hit, which is like 90% of all killing blows, give or take. If the enemy is killed by a critical hit, bleed damage, or blight damage, there won't be a corpse. BUT:  -If the enemy is bleeding/blighted, and is killed with a regular attack, there will still be a corpse!... that is bleeding/blighted. For some eldritch reason, if the enemy doesn't have those last 2 HP taken by bleed or blight damage, it suddenly turns into a corpse that CAN take a load more bleed and blight damage. Absolutely fantastic.  -If the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage, there won't be a corpse. If the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage, there will be a full HP corpse. Being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important, which is their damage.  Both of the above points happen for a very simple reason: artificial difficulty. Forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn, and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you won't be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse. Taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the RNG's by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit, and not just a powerful hit. Because attacking bleeding/blighted enemies, or hitting near-death enemies with powerful skills, so that they wouldn't leave corpses behind? Those would be things the player could control, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?  In order to make corpses borderline bearable, at -least- the following changes would be needed:  -Any enemy that dies while bleeding/blighted would leave no corpse -Any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpse's HP. For example, if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 HP, the corpse would lose 3 HP right as it spawned  And again, this is so corpses would be more bearable. It is no substitute for the fact that, much like heart attacks, they shouldn't exist at -all-.  This is a game I loved and I'm actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in. But I cannot, at all, recommend this game. Regardless, I will update this review once the game is completed  UPDATE: Game is completed, nothing really changed.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"This is a tough one. But to sum it up I just can't recommend the game.   There are some bright spots. First and foremost the atmosphere is great. The narration is just so on point. And it really gets you going. Then the game starts and its just draws you right in. The game goes great. The rougelike keeps its interesting with permadeath and the random stat changes can keep the characters interesting. The art is fantastic. The areas seem interesting and deep.   Then the turn, evetually though the game switches. It really stops being fun it becomes a grind with a capital G. Now I actaully enjoy the grind mostly. Played RPGs all my life and there can be something nice about grinding. However, this game swtiches so hard from the fun of exploring and a very real adventuring sense to this MASSIVE grind that it is jarring and incredibly unfun. The game turns into work there is no progression you feel from anything for a long, long, LONG time.   Due to the atrociousness of the grind the other flaws really start to show. The RNG becomes a bit unbearable. RNG can be really fun and leave a sense of the unexpected in the air. However, when its combined with the Mt. Everest of a grind it becomes this ulgy mechanic that can just ruin any gameplay. For instance, you are forced to run the same area for the millionth time just to grind out some charcters when RNG strikes and you lose someone important. This sucks so much, not that permadeath is bad or that RNG + permadeath can't offer really fun games, but because that it wasn't due to ANYTHING you decided. YOU didn't take a risk, YOU didn't overextend, YOU didn't do anything. The game forced you into a boring task and then punished you for it anyways. Then you realize the maps are the same, the monsters are the same, everything is the same. The rougelike randomness and vareity of monsters in each area that started off very cool has become so very boring. Simply becuase you spend a lifetime in each area trying to grind things out. And switching back and forth does little to break this up due to the sheer number of times you have played a map there.   It is sad it is an amazing game off the bat. You will love it right away, then it will slowly make you hate it, dread turing it on. It becomes a job you can't stand. The polar oppostie of Civ's 'One more turn' instead being 'Ugh, do I have to'.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"So, after seeing this game released and finished, I can finally say it. It's nice to see the early access state to finished barely changed anything, except add in more fake difficulty. Pros: -REALLY, REALLY good artwork and style, some animations could be a tad better, but they're mostly 99% good most of the time. -An interesting gimmick of stress and the psychological horrors that adventuring could have. -Unique quirks system making every hero feel slightly different. -Interesting classes, all with unique dialogue. -Pretty simple game to grasp. -More game options to get rid of... unwanted gameplay aspects. -Super easy to mod, the devs even encourage modding (In case anyone wants to know, just make a comment in the review asking how, and I will be glad to share on how to mod the game). -Death's door to prevent complete and utter insta-kills/give a fighting chance. -Wayne June does an AMAZING job as the ancestor. Honestly, I would say it's the best thing about this game. Cons: -The gimmick of stress is just one huge annoyance, the chances of actually getting into 100+ is by doing a dark run or getting gimmicked by stress attacks. -Heart attacks, 1. Stress takes many years to actually start having health issues, you don't have a heart attack instantly. 2. If you get hit by it once, you now go to insta-death's door, a second time? Bye bye, hero. -Quirk system, most are just annoyances that, once again, are just gimmicks. -Disease system, most are, again, annoyances, however, it needs more balancing (i.e. hero gets Black Plague, throw hero away or cure it because they literally can't help now. Hero get rabies, leave it, it's more of a buff than anything. Hero gets Griping in the Guts, annoying, but it's easy to get around.) -Afflictions and virtue chances, virtue chances are so low, I think it might be possible for someone to have 100+ hours into the game and never get a virtue. Afflictions are major gimmicks, reducing nearly every stat for the hero and making them do random things. You can generally keep going with an affliction, but if the player has more than about 2 rooms, you will have to cut off the run short, only to do... nothing. -Above, why does it do nothing? It's mainly a farm and grind game, any gold you need can easily be obtained just by slamming heroes into dungeons, with or without supplies. The upgrades to the town make it to were you need less gold. Everything is an infinite amount of gold and heirlooms. -Because everything is an infinite supply, including heroes, it makes it more smart to upgrade your town first rather than try and play normally. -Heroes are on infinite supply, no matter what, this game will never truly be hard if there's no true way to 'lose' since gold and heirlooms can be farmed. If you lost all heroes without upgrading the stagecoach, what happens? 4 fresh heroes right there. -Champion dungeons become a long, slow, tedious grind to the boss. It also requires some serious number crunching and near perfect min max team comp, leaving barely any room for expirements. -...The only way you can figure out this game is legitimately rolling low numbers on purpose is modding. How? Perfect example, as a joke, I made the Jester (funny stats for a funny character) do 0-9999 damage with a modifier of 100+% damage increase... he would constantly hit from 2000-4000. You start off with 67% of a death resist, I even increased it to about a 75%... they still have a good chance of dying from 1 hit. -The numbers ROUND DOWN. A double edged blade, to an extent, since it also applies to the enemies. Need an example? A vestal can heal for 7-8. Adding a trinket that gives a 33% heal buff, lowest heal she can get is 9 (9.31, to be precise). Highest would be 10 (10.64, precisely). Instead of rounding up when it hits a .5 and above, it rounds down. This effects the player mostly though because even if they still get rounded down, the enemies can outdamage any negative things that happen. -Class balance is fine for the most part, except the classes that outperform the others, outperform them HEAVILY. A vestal can NEVER outheal any damage, only prolong them from death. An occultist? He can not only have the best debuff in the game, but outheal the damage to a character. Hellions? Best meleer in the game. Why? She's the only class in the game that can hit ranks 2-3 while in rank 1-3 and 4 in rank 1. Lepers cry because once they get pushed to rank 3, they literally can't do anything worthwhile. When they're in ranks 1-2? They can only hit enemy ranks 1-2. Does he have the damage to make up for it? For a normal class? Sorta. Hellion though? She's barely a few points off of leper damage except she can add a bleed DoT. -DoTs... bleed is pretty much the only good DoT. Blight upon hit does 0 damage and at max rank does a DoT of a whopping... 7. Yay. A hellion could basically hit for that along with a bleed that does about 3 damage. I don't understand Red Hook's obsession with blight doing no damage. -However, you need some DoTs because of prot and champion dungeons. With all these recent patches, they added prot which was a means of prolonging the fight to make it 'harder' meaning use some more DoTs just for them. Also, there is no possible way you can get up to the jacked prot the enemies have. The best you will get will probably be 15%, using both trinket slots. -These devs constantly buff enemies while nerfing heroes. Matter of fact, the entire every team is viable has been bogus since the release of the game and has only be stomped more into the ground with these stupid nerfs. -Final level is filled with nothing but stress gimmicks and enemies that tank (granted, they can do a lot of damage, esp. with crits + DoTs) that wants you to min max a team. -There's a slight more, but I won't touch on them except... the crazy, annoying doomsayer. ♥♥♥♥ him. I hope they remove him. His yelling sounds like some bad, cheesey, low budget porno that doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. TL;DR version: The game is good if you're gonna play a small amount and then move on. If you plan to spend a lot of hours in it, pass or wait for about a... 75% sale, at least............. Also ♥♥♥♥ the doomsayer, ♥♥♥♥ing remove him already.  Side note: Before I get ♥♥♥♥ stormed by I'm bad, casual, not helpfuls, etc. I have played enough 'hard' games and even relatively obscure games, Dark Souls (not really obscure, but 'hard, but fair' which a I call bull and beaten it), Legend of Grimrock 1&amp;2, Pillars of Eternity, a few Ys games, and more. I can say, this game would be good for a mobile, up until champions, which can take up to an hour from the tankiness of enemies. I am very far from bad, casual, etc., it's just the way the game plays, it's just meat grind simulator till you can use heroes leveled etc. (specific heroes too) and then it becomes 95% of the time, the house wins game. Huge time sink to even START in the higher level dungeons. Honestly, veteran is the most fun that can be had, and that was ruined by the crit focus every battle.  Side Side Note: I have feeling the people upvoting this generally agree with what I have to say, but if you have read this far, please tell others to not just mindlessly upvote bad and/or good reviews. It doesn't help anyone, and it can possibly even mix opinions and facts. For example, if one says x game is bad because it requires too much number crunching whereas another one says x game is bad because it seems like the devs wanted you to be a 2 year old to play, then... yeah, kinda hard to truly tell where opinions and facts start and end. So, please try to spread the word of don't upvote/downvote till you know where this review is coming from. Also, don't upvote memes and joke reviews, it, once again, hurts to see where facts and opinions mix. Just... vote funny and move on.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I'm not going to tell you what Darkest Dungeon is about in terms of gameplay, since that's something that you can easily learn from the store page, of course. I just want to express my conclusions on the game after beating it. It's wonderful, really, especially if you love Lovecraft like I do. The overall aesthetic, the sound design, the narrative, everything looks great and polished. Combat feels very satisfying and has you literally scream in joy and terror in front of the screen. It's awesome. There's a ton of content too, it took me more than 70 hours to beat the game (it's also very possible to do it in a much shorter time, of course). But this can be quite a stressful experience aswell, not just for your heroes but for you, the player. While I found most of the campaign to be very enjoyable, the endgame really killed most of my enthusiasm and almost got me to the point of giving up playing to just watch the ending on YouTube. This is because the game gets very grindy during the final quests: the Darkest Dungeon is a pretty rough place, and it will probably kill many of your heroes. And unless you send legendary heroes, your party will be dead long before it can explore the dungeon enough to give a clear notion of how the various mobs and bosses fight. And remember that there can be no retreat from that place without at least one dead hero. The grinding aspect kicks in when you realize that you don't have the legendary heroes you need for a particular quest and that you have to train new ones up to level six in order to get a single chance to succeed. Even if you win a Darkest Dungeon quest, the survivors will permanently refuse to embark on the following ones, thus becoming useless.  Yet the game does actually provide you with some hints so that you can immediately guess which heroes you should bring in a particular quest in the Dungeon. (let's imagine that you are tasked with killing a boss, and that maybe the name of said boss can help you plan your party composition before you start the mission...) But since I was too dumb to notice such hints, I finally decided to use a guide to beat the last missions of the game. I guess I'm just not that good with this kind of games, I can't come up with particularly good strategies in terms of party composition, so that my chances of victory often depend on RNG and luck. Plus, this is not Dark Souls or Super Meat Boy, you WILL be punished even though you don't deserve it. Many have criticized the importance of RNG in Darkest Dungeon, but it's a necessary element in a game that wants you to feel stressed whenever your heroes do.  That said, I did beat the game with default difficulty options: you can toggle off some mechanics in order to make your experience less frustrating if you feel you can't stand the overall difficulty of the game. You'll probably be labelled a 'casual' from hardcore players and you won't be given a particular achievement when you beat the game, but who cares. Your heroes will go crazy during the adventure, make sure you don't. The fact that you are given an option to customize the overall difficulty of the experience is the main reason why I would recommend Darkest Dungeon to anyone, even those who are not familiar with the genre. It's probably still going to hit you hard even in 'casual mode' but, as the game tells you, there can be no victory without madness.  EDIT (12 March 2016): the Antiquarian Update solved most of the issues I had with the endgame. So most of what I said above about grinding should no longer be of concern. Great job, developers!",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Even if at the time I purchased this (when everybody and his dog was posting gameplay videos of it on Youtube) this was a unique and very promising title (thus my desire to support the devs even in Early Access), as of late they have started 'balancing' the game using cheap, illogical and lazyass game mechanics slapped on top of previously slapped cheap, illogical and lazyass mechanics without giving all that much thought whether those would actually fix anything and their impact on the game, not to mention whether lore-wise those would make any sense whatsoever. Which seems to be a trend with this studio - they come up with game mechanics to fix problems, real or imagined, but never actually think whether those would be fun or fit the lore (not to mention being logical), which in the end brings more of a repetitious tedium than anything else without fixing much, if anything. Even worse - some of those new game mechanics introduce new problems which get 'fixed' in the same fashion... All of that resulted in an illogical, frustrating and very much grindy experience. The truly spot-on art style, music and narrator could no longer offset the tedium and as such the game simply became un-fun. To the point where this happened:   http://www.thejimquisition.com/darkest-dungeon-and-the-perils-of-early-access/   as a result of which Jim Sterling, as a Steam curator, eventually decided to take down his own Early Access recommendation for this game...  (On a related note   this   is a relevant read as well)  The devs’ desire to make the game hard(er) for the sake of it (and there is only one difficulty setting with no plans for adding more) thus meant that for example higher-tier maggots in dungeons had more armor than even your best armored crusaders in one of the previous patches. Maggots! Why? Because this is how this studio decided to increase the game difficulty - where each maggot was basically like a terminator sent back from the future to end your line. They introduced more randomness for the sake of randomness, grinding for the sake of 'prolonging' the content, and introduced an overall, fake, difficulty increase (clad in the impenetrable armor of tedium) because according to the devs this is supposedly a  roguelike  game (which it really isn't - this is basically XCOM with Ironman permanently ON but with Cthulhu monsters instead of aliens and a lot more illogical randomness). It has randomly generated (and very generic) dungeon layouts, hero permadeath and a single automatic save – and that’s it. It has no fail state. You literally cannot lose. According to   this   it also never will. It will have even more grinding though. A lot more - once the last, fifth endgame dungeon is implemented it will require you to finish multiple missions, as it were, in it, only unlike the other four dungeons it would not allow you to retreat in case things get hairy. Which means that if your heroes fail their mission they will perish trying - which is perfectly fine. Problem is - in case your heroes are victorious they will get a perk preventing them from doing more missions in the endgame dungeon effectively forcing you to grind more heroes from level 0 (no, you cannot hire higher level heroes) in the other four dungeons as to attempt to finish the game. Basically you have to grind one full party of heroes per endgame mission and that is assuming you finish them all at first attempt. Yeah...  Despite the game being in Early Access and the devs constantly proclaiming that they appreciate and value player feedback such game altering changes are NEVER put out for public testing prior to release, even if Steam allows beta patches to be installed by those who want to do so and test such changes before they make it into the live build. Such changes are also never discussed or even listed (anywhere) prior to coming to the live build. It is literally expected that people would simply take them for what they are, like them and praise the devs for their hard work. “Communication” with these devs is strictly a one-way street and takes the form of their patch notes. Criticism was simply ignored in the past. Now it is actively censored with people often getting banned and their whole post history outright deleted.  All of this has had its effect. According to   this  [steamspy.com]   the game sold more than 400 000 copies on Steam so far. But according to   this  [steamcharts.com]   between sales and major patches on average 700-800 people play it. Which put into perspective means that only 0.2% of the owners of this game actively play it for what it is. The other 99.8% do not, and as of writing this the numbers are still falling...  In its current state, as an Early Access title, I really cannot recommend this game. As a matter of fact I'd advise you to stay away from it. The developers do not seem to have a clear-cut vision of what their game is to be, seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun) and since they neither ask for nor heed any player feedback there doesn't seem to be much hope of them getting this right by the time it is officially released, which as of writing this is 3 months or so away.  As a conclusion I'd like to add that this is not my first Early Access game. Nor is it the most expensive. Some of my other Early Access games have been basically completely abandoned by their devs and never got finished as such. But despite all that Darkest Dungeon is the Early Access game that managed to convince me, once and for all, to never, ever, buy into Early Access games again.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I gotta say it is the first time I'm making a 'that huge' review of a game, but this game is really worth doing it.  I bought it on the first day of release, after watching a few reviews, I really hoped that all of that was said wasn't that frustrating, because the game really seemed to be unique, well-designed and even drawn as good as a Bob Ross painting.  I gotta say that my first impression were excellent, there was absolutely nothing that really dissapointed me. Every dungeons, classes, buildings gave me a great feeling of 'God there's so much different things to do and try', and the first ten hours (because I like to take my time) were the funniest hours I've spent on a game since a few years. Every characters (or class) feel unique, they all have their quality and flaws, they have damage or debuff or DoT or even heal/protect skills, they have some kind of specialities (like multi-targeting or crit or DoT...) and even some great art. Every building have a good impact on the game and makes you feel 'doing what you are doing for a reason'. There's also Torch management, Inventory and objects management (as some object can be really usefull on fights), stress management, etc... I mean there's a lot of great thought features that will make you be really, REALLY happy at the beginning.  Yeah everything was fine, fun, balanced, and so much more, until I reached the level 5 part of the game (The maximum level is 6 by the way).  Then monsters began to be completely unfair, most of them are going from 10HP 0% Protection, 10 dodge and 6-10 damage, to 26-50HP, 35% Protection 36 Dodge, and a ridiculous increase of damage (some hits for 30 crit even with 25% damage reduction, no jokes). You might think it's fair if you didn't buy the game yet because you can upgrade your heroes, but the main problem comes from the fact that if you upgrade TO MAXIMUM your characters, overall they'll win 5 damage/10 accuracy (depends of the class though), 10-20HP and 10 dodge, and they still have a completely unbalanced factor of damage/heal (like going from 5-8 damage to 7-14). What that means for real is that THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. Melee characters can't hit anymore and will miss 40% of their attacks even with a huge accuracy boost, ranged character will deal the same amount of damage to opponent than they previously were on level 1 because of the insane protection boost on monsters and will even miss 1/3 of their attacks, heals will go from 4-6 to 6-10 even fully upgraded which CAN'T follow the damage upgrade of your ennemies. You feel like being completely torn apart every fight, and struggle to make your characters survive even for a single turn. The stress management becomes impossible to handle, as on 100 stress most of your characters will begin to pass their turn, wound themselves, disagree to get healed or use the wrong skill, and you have to surrender most of the dungeons after 4 rooms because even 1 firecamp break wasn't enough to make them feel better, if you didn't lose someone already.  Some classes will survive and 'do' some things, but 60% of the other class (there's 15 on the game) will struggle so much that it's just impossible to use them. You'll have to spend half the gold you made to treat some disease that are impossible to avoid, to treat their stress as even if you are the best coach in the world, it's impossible not to reach the 100 bars on at least 3 of your heroes (and skills that reduce stress are mostly useless btw) which gives the game a more frustrating than hard feeling.  After 40 hours of gameplay, I never tried the level 6 dungeon of the game and the only level 5 dungeons I made were short ones. There's a terrible grinding of gold to do because of how much you'll need to spend after every dungeon (but when you think afterwards, it's the most fun part of the game because you'll farm gold on level 1 balanced dungeons with funny/original strats or composition !).   I first thought that I was just bad, or making bad decisions, but after trying so much builds, classes, and reading a lot of people reviews, it's just sad to say, but the game is NOT FUN AT ALL on the endgame. Losing character is a point of the game (as the developpers said), but if you lose them because it's really hard, or you took a critical strike, or your heal get stunned on the wrong turn, it's pretty funny actually, it happens, it's a part of the Roleplay, etc..., you'll have to be more careful or change your trinkets to decrease the odds of death happening next time. But here, it's just completely luck based, and you feel like you got absolutely no chances of winning and all the odds are AGAINST you. The only hope you have is if your character land the CRITICAL HIT OF HIS LIFE that you needed, which means that 1/18 of the time it'll be an okay fight only because of luck, none of your management has a real impact.  If I can add one last thing, is that your characters have positions, which basicly allows them to use some different skills. Great feature I have to say, but what I find unfortunate is that this positionning has impact on YOUR HEROES ONLY, it's changes nothing for the opponent, they do whatever they want to whoever they want. It would be even more fun if your positions changed the amont of dodge, or damage you take, of even damage you deal or accuracy I don't know, which could make 'tank' be a real thing, or healer be less vulnerable. It would actually give a certain amount of strategy and credit to the combination of heroes you try to make.  Don't get me wrong, I got no regrets for buying this game, and it is still terribly fun on the early part, but there's a huge difference (as everybody said) between 'The games involves dying because it is hard' and pure frustration, pure madness, pure luck. To make a comparison, when you play Roulette, you choose the amount and the numbers you bet on. Here, it's like watching the bet table, only allowed to bet all your money on a single number, as you are not even changing your odds of winning, dying, or whatever, every time you enter a level 5+ dungeon or equipping different trinkets.  I still have to give a huge shout out to the developpers, who did overall an absolutely beautiful and enjoyable game, one that we were waiting for a long time, one that is beating most of the other games out there and even big studios ones. But I hope that the future updates will give a brighter future to the game (and that unfair points will change to hard points), as more and more players are reviewing this game badly because of the sames problems over and over again.  EDIT : For all those who says 'You need to watch a playthrough on internet etc...' well if the point of the game is to take the same characters as an internet guy and do the exact same thing (because other things don't work as intended), it breaks COMPLETELY all the DnD, discover by yourself, experiment, point of the game, which is to me the best point of all. I took the Vestal for healing because it is more constant even if it heals less than the occulist, but everybody told to me 'Naah don't take the vestal, just take the occulist', then what is the point of the game if it's just to play like hearthstone and brainlesly taking other's people decks ? Where's the fun part ?",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon is a 2D RPG dungeon crawler with a grim premise promising hardship and challenge to anyone who enters.  The good: +Fantastic artstyle, narrator and music! The atmosphere of Darkest Dungeon is simply amazing. +The characters the player can recruit are all different and have fun quips and personalities. +Addictive dungeon crawling that will make you go for 'just one more quest.' +The UI is elegant and superbly done. +The devs have added options to remove/toggle corpses, nerf enemy crits and more small tweaks. +Certain heroes now bring items with them when embarking, for example the crusader will bring holy water.  The bad: -The difficulty isn't a curve, but a wall, a wall that has been known to be hit even in the tutorial. The game wants to be hard and that's a fine selling point. However, this is not elegant design like Dark Souls, but rather by arbitrarily stacking the odds against you.  -You have to juggle gold, experience points and resources for buildings in order to progress, which is fine in theory, but gold will quickly become the least of your worries as you grind away at resources and while doing that you have to avoid overleveling heroes as this makes it impossible for them to participate in missions they will then deem to easy, yes you read that right, your heroes will actually go against your orders.  -With a huge variety in heroes imbalance is sure to arise, but the issue is how obvious it is. For example, the plague doctor has been one of the weakest hero types throughout this entire Early Access, and they still are because they simply can't match the healing of the Vestal or the damage of the Arbalist.  -Most trinkets are useless. Almost all of them come with one or two bonuses, but also one or two negatives. A select few artifacts only have bonuses, but they usually aren't too great and they are hard to find.  -The quirk system is currently stacked against the player, just like everything else. Negative quirks can fester and become extremely expensive to get rid off. Positive quirks don't have this option, so sometimes after leveling you'll lose valuable quirks because your hero leveled up. Furthermore, diseases are now their own seperate thing, but they don't disappear over time and have to be removed as well, once again, it's just tedium for tedium's sake, because now you have to spend even longer on grinding them away too.  -Red Hook has so far with every update and without fail nerfed heroes and strategies into oblivion, which is fine, afterall the game should be balanced. However, they have crossed the line where it has now become mandatory to use a walkthrough on how to min-max. Gone are the days where 4 jesters could enter a dungeon and while they wouldn't be a great team they could pull through.  -After nearly 50 hours it has become clear to me that one of the biggest issues is the pacing. Upgrading your town takes way too many resources and you never gain the ability to hire heroes higher than level 0. You never truly lose, you're just doing the same thing over and over, always making the same heroes and dismissing them after they become too expensive to make viable.  Bottom line: Darkest Dungeon has so much potential and back when I first bought it I was absolutely hooked by the atmosphere and surface gameply, but once you get deeper you realize just how poor the execution truly is. One misstep feels like it can ruin your entire game; forcing you to start over.  The game still has immense potential, but the goal of making a hard game has grown and taken over the core design and it's killing the experience. I vehemently hope that I can change this to a recommendation once the next promised update hits.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Want to play a game where you can play as safe and as optimally as possible, and STILL get taken out by the RNG that seems to be tipped against you? Boy, have I got a treat for you!  If the enemies get a few lucky rolls, they can take out a character's entire healthbar before you're given the chance to intervene, flushing several hours worth of progress (not to mention a lot of luck!) down the drain. On the flipside, you can play like absolute garbage and have nobody in your party die ever because whether or not a character lives or dies when they're at 0hp is purely down to chance.  I get that the design is supposed to force the player to make the best of a bad situation, and I can get behind that, but at this stage (As of today, 'This stage' is the game as the devs invisioned it on release. There's no hope for change.) there are too many design decisions that force the outcome out of the player's hands. This is probably because the part of the game that is actually up to the player is so easy - if you've got at least a few braincells rubbing together, it doesn't take long to figure out how to play it optimally. So, rather than address that, the developers have decided to make it randomly kick you in the nuts every few minutes. This doesn't make it deep or challenging, just frustrating.   The golden moments where the game achieves what it sets out to do with it's chaos management mechanics are few and far between, and most RNG punishment tends to go around instantly eliminating one of your heroes. Rather than requiring you to adapt your strategy because of the loss of a character, you're able to just go back to a level 1 dungeon and start over because all it takes to replace a dead hero is to grind a few levels. It doesn't add any extra challenge, it just forces you to grind more.  It fits into the new-wave 'Hardcore' trend following Dark Souls, where being 'Hardcore' comes more from marketing and player perspective than actually being a difficult game and, as a result, that's the philosophy that drives the worst elements of it's design. What's more, players who picked up the game based on this marketing are willing to defend these elements to the death, because if the public perception were to change to see the mechanics *the way they are* without the 'omg so hardcore' veneer, that would invalidate the hardcore gamer cred they feel they've earned by suffering through the game's grind. If you're feeling 'Called out' at this point, that's great, because I think you're a tool.  Art, storytelling and atmosphere are A+, and I'm going to come back to it just for that when the last of the content is added, but the game itself is a grind facilitated by RNG that shouldn't pose any actual challenge to anyone with a reasonable knowledge of CRPG mechanics.  I rate this game 2.5 out of 5 loaded dice.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon is a beautiful, atmospheric and well put together game, let down by mistaking randomness for difficulty.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I would compare this game to a long book that you might really enjoy at first but then by the end you're kind of annoyed at how it drags on. It's just way too long for how little content/progression there is, it's honestly so long that the rare occasion i see story content I don't even remember what I'd been told in the past. Also, when a game is this unforgiving you'll usually crest over a point where your gear/characters starts synergizing really well and that satisfactory dominance makes the strugle all worth it. This game never gives you that, it just gets harder and harder and you'll lose your best guys and items to some rng and have to start a whole group of fresh characters all over again. The styling and gameplay is cool but I can't reccomend this game to anynoe knowing how much drudgery it ends up being. If you do decide to play it make sure you reference the wiki on every single curio/boss fight- trying to play without it by trial and error will extend the game by probably 30+ hours.",-1,1

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"There's no way to give this game a fair review anymore.  The fanbase for Darkest Dungeon is split so far down the middle that we have two completely extreme views: people praising and loving the game and disregarding any and all faults; then there's the other side with people saying that the game is an utter time waster with no fun, a slew of bugs, and all sorts of other complaints.  I'm sure what I have to say at this point will matter to no one. But I'll do my best review it based on my own thoughts, rather than the opinions I have read elsewhere online. But I will delve into those later.  I'm not the smartest guy. I'll be up front about that. I rarely go into games and know exactly what things that can be exploited, what must be done to make this or that easy, find loopholes or redundencies. I don't have the patience to go through each and every stat effect and percentage and chart it all out. Its just not something I have interest in or time to do. With this in mind, you can probably tell that I don't actually look into the RNG all that much.  Critical hits are critical hits. Misses are misses. I never noticed if one side had an advantage over the other. I never noticed the effects that torches had on the battlefield cuz I always had one lit. I never noticed if one side got more buffs or had resistances or any of that. I just played the game how I thought it should be played.  Here is where my biggest issue with the entirety of the game comes into play: the inability to play how you want.   Now, I get it. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be difficult. its meant to put you into a corner, but its boot to your jaw and see how you can escape it. Here's a few things I don't like, however, about said difficulty - with personal examples from the game:  -battle mechanics, on a defensive side. What do I mean by this? Well, once I was playing through a dungeon. I had a tough time with a wave, and wanted to go on the defensive for a bit, get some health back real quick before I proceeded to the next battle. So I kept an enemy in stunlock/debuff while I used my healer to get my fighters back into a better spot. With this one enemy left completely weak and vulnerable, it seemed like a viable strategy in order to get my footing back and continue strong. But NOPE. Literally two turns after trying this strategy, two enemies randomly come out of the woodwork. Because this game has to be SO HARD that it just throws more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you.  What this said to me was this: no, player, you do not play how you want to play. You cannot use the strategies YOU want to use. You play by OUR rules. You go fast, and kill fast, and if your players die in the process, well TOO BAD.   Some players may see this as just another part of the challenge, but I see this as a fundamental flaw: you are not allowed to play this game how you see fit. You are not allowed to go on the defensive, take advantage of a situation and play to your strenghts. You can ONLY play how the devs WANT you to play. And that, to me, isn't fun. It is frustrating. Its tedious. And it lead to me shutting off the game and not playing it ever again.  -escaping battle. This is a shorter one, but still a grievance with the game I personally have. So, when you escape battle, you are given a consequence of stress. I saw this as a fair trade. If things are going badly, you have the choice to take the stress in order to fight another day.  This brilliant idea was ruined by the timeworn BS cliche of: not being able to escape. So not only do I have to accept the consequence of a massive stress boost when I actually manage to get out of battle, I have to risk my party members in an entire turn that could possibly get any of them killed if the escape attempt fails. That. Is not. Ok. Take one punishment, don't put them all in one basket. And don't give me the 'git gud' crap everyone else does - we all enter bad situations in this game that we need to escape once in a while. RNG makes it so. Don't corner the player by making them worry if they'll escape or not, and if you want to keep that, fine, but get rid of the added stress issue then. Pick one poison and stick to it.  -the stress meter. Now, I have to say, this was actually one of the reasons I was fascinated with this game at first. It seemed like such a neat mechanic that could actually end up with GOOD results, and not bad.  Out of the countless times my characters reached full stress, only twice has something heroic happened. This should be a 50/50 chance, and not a 10/90, imo. You're already threatening death with the stress waves (which apparently wasn't in the original EA version), why make it even more challenging by not giving the player a fair shot at feeling amazing? Because you're too busy making it feel frustratingly difficult? That's why? Eh.  Now with all that said, you'd think I HATE this game. I'm just another one of those jerks on the internet saying its the worst thing ever. But here's the thing: I don't. With all that said, I still love so much about the game:  -The art style. So refreshingly simple, yet bold and interesting.   -The music. Tense, adds to the atmosphere, and well composed.  -The designs. Goes hand in hand with art style, in a way, but every class looks very unique and stands out in their own way.  -the voice acting. Top ♥♥♥♥ing notch, hard not to love. Complex dialogue makes this game feel intelligent (even if the narrator isn't saying anything most of the time other than 'this ♥♥♥♥ sucks sometimes yo').  -fascinating game mechanics, like stress and perks/negatives. While some people abbhore some of these things, I am impressed with how many different things your characters can get, both positive and negative.  There are things to LOVE about this game. There are things to HATE about this game. I am left torn down the middle. I want to like this game. I want to get swept up inside of it, lose myself for hours on end from dungeon to dungeon but...every time a risky dungeon is presented, I don't want to take it because I fear I have to start from scratch from a different warrior. The fact that people think that the death of your character is a fair punishment just isn't true. All those hours and money into these particular characters you want to crusade through dungeons with are put out within minutes due to bad RNG, bad situations, or just bad planning or poor decision making.  And even if it WAS all my fault, even if it WAS misdirection or poor planning or player error or...whatever, even with all that in mind and the fact that my character(s) died, wasting hours of my life because of simple mistakes, is that ok? Does it make it a fun challenge? Or a slog?  The answer is that there is no answer. This game is dependent on what you like as a gamer, and as a person, really. You're not a bad person for liking this game. And you're not bad for disliking it. I see the points of people on both sides. And I think everyone should just calm the ♥♥♥♥ down and learn to deal with other people's opinions on the internet (although that probably won't ever happen, even though it should).  As for me...this game is interesting. Its stressful. Its tactful. Its challenging. But, in spite of things, it just isn't fun to me. A lot of times it felt like a chore. To the point where I no longer wanted to play. Take that for what its worth.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"UPDATED FOR FINAL RELEASE:   I got this back in June during Early Access and the journey has had a lot of ups and downs. This might in part be my fault since I got involved during this stage- most people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when Facebook changes it's layout. You can only imagine how rustled I'd get when I'd get on and find the gameplay mechanics of DD would change. But I can accept those twists and turns as part of the development process.   With that said... And believe me, I've dumped 100+ hours into this game so I say this with a heavy heart, I'm pretty dissapointed with where they took this during that time of development.   Darkest Dungeon doesn't have any obvious one glaring flaw, but small things add up and it's the small things the devs take that do the most damage. Now obviously this is supposed to be a harsh and adverse game- the whole point is to be difficult and unforgiving, after all. Right?   Well, yes, you would be right. The game itself proclaims that is about 'Making the most of a bad situation', how there will be deaths, there will be failure, and so on. It warns you right out of the starting gate. Hell, that's part of the reason I got into this game. I liked the idea of a dungeon crawler with long lasting wear and tear on adventuring. Your heroes getting quirks (for better and for worse), diseases, weird obsessions, that's all pretty damn cool and it helps make the game what it is.  But the problems come from the small things that add up. I don't think DD's problems come from any of it's core ideas, but the ways they're implemented. You want the game to be difficult, unforgiving even, but you still want it to be fun, challenging, and most importantly, -rewarding-   PROS: - The art is fantastic. Absolutely terrific and it never gets tiring to look at.  - The soundtrack is great. I'm not even sure how to label it, but imagine a mix of horror, grunge and epic orchestra.  - The game's narrator, played by Wayne June (who has done countless audiobook readings of H.P Lovecraft's works) is perfect in every way for the role and just oozes a brooding edge.  - The core gameplay is simple, intuitive and the team manages to build a lot of complexity and synergy out of the turn based combat.   CONS: 1) The game has gotten progressively more bent on grinding. There are 5 areas in the game. Each area has two bosses. You must fight each of those bosses three times. Each of these bosses is at a different level ranking. Higher level heroes cannot play lower level dungeons. If you do not plan out managing three or 4 teams of different ranking hereos far in advance of this, you are going to tack on days of extra gameplay just trying to cultivate competent teams to fight bosses you've already battled several times. This doesn't even take possible Total Party Kills into account. It also doesn't take into account the time you need to kill waiting for heroes to recover from stress, disease, crippling quirks or just straight up wandering off.   This isn't difficult, challenging, or rewarding. It is tedious. It can be infuriating. But not as infuriating as...  2) Not getting any sort of reward or compensation for slugging through said grind. I'm not asking for a pat on the head and a slice of birthday cake pushed into my mouth for not quitting 30 seconds into the game. However, most games, especially the grindy ones, usually give you something in return for putting all that time in.   Your level 6 'Legendary' heroes have fought their way up the blood soaked ladder, having disposed of countless monstrosities and grappled with their personal demons time and time again. They're scarred, they're battered, they're hard boiled sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es that live to claw the eyes out of mutant fish monsters. You've given them the best armor, the best trinkets, and pair them up in groups where they synergize the best.   They drop like flies in the Darkest Dungeon area. There's no weight, no reward for dragging your guys through the mud until they're legendary. They're just as likely to spazz out and panic as they were at level 0, they can barely cut through High Protection level enemies, and the same cultists jerks you've been slapping around since Week 1 can now give them heart attacks in 4 turns if you don't take them out immediately because now they get arbitrarily huge stat numbers for the final dungeon.  Speaking of arbitrary numbers....  3) The hardest parts of the game are mechanics outside of the combat and exploration that the devs use to punish the player.   A game like this ought to punish you for making stupid mistakes. A game like this should throw lasting repurcussions at you for failure. Games like XCOM do this really well because said repurcussions feel like natural cause and effect for the situation. DD does not do this, and it feels more malicious than anything. It doesn't tell you the rules it wants you to play by, and when you step out of line it'll take your hand off for it. ESPECIALLY if it catches you trying to heal your party up when only a single enemy is left. It used to be content just to make your party get stressed, but now it throws a new mob of enemies at you.   And that's really the big problem. With a game as challenging as this, the struggle alone should be enough, but the game will actively punish you for struggling.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  These are the problems with Darkest Dungeon. Corpses and heart attacks are annoying when the game first surprised you with them during Early Access, but with adjustment they fit right in and mesh with the tone, the difficulty and open up new lanes of strategy. Those aren't the problems, those are challenges.    Darkest Dungeon is not a bad game- on the contrary I think there's an excellent game in here, but it's buried under the weight of a lot of busywork and excessive punishment it doles out at you for not doing what it wants (but doesn't tell you to). It takes and it takes, but it never gives back.   Darkest Dungeon is a game of diminishing returns. I'm not saying you should avoid it, but heed my warning: You'll love Darkest Dungeon, but no matter how much time and work you give to it, it won't love you back.   Kinda like an ex, really.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"TL:DR - I don't feel rewarded for the effort that I put into the game. I am disappointed to say the least.  So after beating the game I stand by my points since early access. The game just isn't rewarding to play with how much grind and garbage you gotta slog through to reach the end and then it hardly feels like you are overcoming a great evil so much as it feels like you just have to exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to pass. I don't feel like I was truly challenged, just constantly had someone trying to cheat me. I genuinely feel like all the positive ratings for the game are a result of the 'git gud' crowd who themselves probably suck. A challenge to overcome is what I live for. Darkest dungeon was less a challenge and more a gamble.  Honestly I was hoping the ending dungeons and ending itself would be rewarding, but instead I feel pretty empty. I guess that's the way you feel when you are so mad at a game you are just trying to find something good in it and you just don't.  Darkest dungeon is playing a poker game and going all in. You play your hand, clench your teeth and/or buttcheeks, and then you win and get a ♥♥♥♥ load of money. After getting home you realize that you spent a crap load of money on cheetos and soda and also you need to spend some money on releiving stress from the ordeal (for some reason) and end up with just enough money in the positives to buy a soda and enough money left over to do it all again. Not very satisfying.  As of July 15th I've pretty much given up on the game. There's no point in trying to help anymore. I don't really care that all my saves were deleted. I don't really care that they nerfed the crap outta camping buffs. I don't care heavily that crusader protection is useless. I'm not crying after they ruined any reason to play in the dark. I don't fully care that enemies hit extra hard and do extra stress. I don't really find it awful that being marked is considered a means of protection. I'm not upset that my highwayman was killed in the tutorial. I'm not offended that when the game crashes some buffs/debuffs are gone from characters. It doesn't bother me that you can just Alt + f4 when one of your guys gets deathblowed to avoid it. I'm not sad that the game gets kinda monotonous after a bit and I can let the fact they ignore teaching boss mechanics slide.  But the fact you can lose a party member from 100% to 0% just by encountering spiders in the first mission and it's been this way since I started playing? No. Screw this game.    In the end, what really matters is your own opinion. The thing is that in my opinion I was not satisfied with the end results of the game.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Idk what people are complaining about.  Its dark and gritty Its hard AF (not ridiculous, but definitely challenging, to the same degree as Dark Souls) its compelling, with a great atmosphere It's innovative with mechanics and lasting effects Its got an awesome art style Its got a traditional turn-based combat with some nice twists You WILL have to restart and learn from your previous mistakes (several times probably) You need to think and plan long-term, right from the start You will make calculated losses If you think you'll like it, you probably will",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"A mutant pig vomited on my character and gave them tapeworm. This made them eat more than their share of food and caused my party to starve at a camp. This caused one of them to become so stressed they abused someone else until they had a heart attack.  I had to send the rest back to town and buy them alcohol, women and let one flagellate themself so they felt better. I get a bill the next day from the brothel saying the Occultist can't come back because of his deviant fetishes. I sent him home; no chill, no dungeons.  11/10 ruin your life.   EDIT / ACTUAL REVIEW:  I have spent some time reading other reviews of Darkest Dungeon and here's some real talk addressing the most common complaints:  1) 'RNG PLEASE!!!'  - Yes this game contains RNG, why not learn to play around that?   Sometimes your Leper will be crit from 100-0 by a fat man in chainmail. Your move Crusader. Man, if only King Arthur, 1st of His Name, Biggest of Jockstraps, Defender of the Realm and Slayer of Harems had thought to bring a band-aid to get Ol' Compost the Leper off of death's door then he might have lived. Oh wait he totally has that skill. You just didn't equip it because biggest sword is best sword. Big RNG crits sink happy little adventurer's ships, so run a very low level heal skill on 3/4 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen. The Leper lives, and you don't have to go home and tell his, ah, remaining foot that the rest won't be coming home. You do get better at the game, you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes. I've run 20-30 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character. To those who say 'TOO MUCH RNG, NOT EVEN A GAME': proper prior planning prevents ♥♥♥♥ (urine) poor performance.  2) 'TRINKETS ARE TRASH, NO REWARD!!!'  - Trinkets have upsides and downsides, why not combine two trinkets? *brainexplosion*  e.g. +30% heals, +20% stress. 'THIS IS TERRIBLE I'LL DIE OF STRESS' says big bubba. Oh wait what's this? A trinket that says -20% stress? What if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team that'll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be. Legendary trinkets are legendary, proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful. There's no free hand outs, use strategy and planning to win dungeons.  3) 'THE GAME IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND!!!'  - If you're taking forever to finish the game, then you're losing too many people. The game is easily finishable within 60 hours. True end game dungeoning can take a long time, because of certain factors which come into effect. However at the end game there are catch-up mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast. Procedurally generated rogue-like games such as this, you are essentially doing one dungeon after another. The only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time, and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses, which have their own surprises.  I wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with: 1) Difficult gameplay, where consequences are real. 2) Brothels 3) Tentacles",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"What greater satisfaction you need than hitting your opponent right after weakening them with a terrible finishing blow? What greater frustration can you suffer than seeing the enemies dog-pile on a single hero, rendering it useless in a single turn?  Make no mistake, this game can be incredibly frustrating at times. The difficulty constantly ramps up, as you try to keep your heroes health and stress in check. Enemies poison you and leave you bleeding with ease, and a bad turn can easily screw an entire expedition, and cost you good men.  But as soon as you get in rhythm. As soon as you understand how to manage your items, what characters have the better synergy together, how to position them in a fight, and how to counter the monstrosities you find in every mission, what once seemed unfair becomes just a challenge. A hard challenge, that you can still loose; but when you do, you learn to just arm another party and send them to prevail where the others failed.  The game makes it's own the despair and hopelessness of the Lovecraft mythos both in aesthetic and theming, while adding a splash of cinical and dark sense of humor. You are not here to become an immortal, unstoppable force of nature, you are here to try and survive an onslaught of horror way beyond what men can really handle. And the game will make sure you feel that in every corner, just as the men you send to fight, and leave the dungeons more and more psychologically crippled every time they go out. But so what? We are all doomed anyway, right?  If you like turn-based RPGs, Rogue-like games, or just challenging experiences, this one is worth a shot.",1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I've played over 60 hours of this game and as much as I would love to give this a great review, I just can't do it.  This game can truly be one of the greats...Great voice acting, great visual artwork, great story, great dungeon crawling experience. There's just one thing this game is lacking...the very essence of gaming that all rpgers especially cherish--SOME TYPE OF GOD DAMN REWARD SYSTEM FOR SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS PLAYING THE GAME!!!  This game has amazing potential, but the 'reward' for playing and progressing through the game are almost non-existent. All of the equipable items are almost worthless. Even the legendary items are pretty much worthless! I mean, how do you create a game where the most powerful items have so many drawbacks for equiping them that you might as well just dungeon crawl NAKED. Also, one more thing, this game is so RNG heavy that bad luck alone can wipe your whole party and set you back on hours of gameplay. It's just complete randomness and chaos. Not even realisticly random. more like oppressive, sadistic, everything-is-against-you random where you have no control of anything because the combat system is rediculously imbalanced and the tide of battle can shift at any given time no matter how good a player you are.  The hours of frustration playing this game outweigh the good times, which is unfortunate.   These developers need to wake up and make some 'adjustments'. Don't buy this game unless you want to pull your hair out.  ",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I wanted to give this game a stellar recommendation. But given what this game has become, I cannot do so in good conscience.  When I first bought this game back when it was in early access, it was something really interesting. An incredible aesthetic matched by a gameplay that married the best aspects of RPGs and Dungeon Crawlers, with its own twists and turns that made for a wholly engrossing experience. It wasn't perfect, but it was challenging, enjoyable, and most importantly of all, rewarding.   All the way through the development process, I'd periodically start up a new run to see what sort of changes had been made, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. The difficult of the game got ramped up, but so too did the classes themselves. The fights were both terrifying and exhilarating, and taking down a boss felt like a triumphant moment. The new classes were interesting, and the quirks system made them feel like more than just a grouping of mechanics.   I didn't mind the introduction of heart attacks and corpses, as they forced me to keep a closer eye on my stress levels and put more thought into my party lineups.   As Darkest Dungeon reached its final stage, the very same elements that made it so fun and enjoyable for me have become twisted into something that has turned the game into the exact opposite. Reaching Resolve level 5 and 6 used to be an accomplishment, a marker that these characters/heroes had faced overwhelming odds and achieved a greater state of being. You would face off against some truly powerful and terrifying enemies, but your characters were on par with that power and could exchange blow for blow. There was a balance, and even when the tide of battle turned against you there was still a chance that you could pull off a victory from the jaws of defeat.   Now, the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you. Don't even think about going into a higher level dungeon with even one of your characters not fully upgraded, as they will die. At first, I thought the sudden skyrocketing of my casualty rates were the result of me making a tactical error, but when I looked at play throughs online I found that people who were more or less equally skilled as I was were suffering from similar casualty rates, for similar reasons. I don't mind losing someone because of an error that I made, but losing it because the RNG decided 'they gonna die now' is strikes me as something that is blatantly unfair. Especially when in order to bring them up to the point where they can survive the upper level dungeons requires hours of joyless grinding for resolve and gold, and the fruits of those labors don't seem to have an impact on their overall survivability.  In general, Darkest Dungeon does an extremely poor job of explaining the way different features work, or what to expect when going into a new location or facing off against a new type of boss. Which i don't necessarily mind per-say, but when the cost of failure are so high that they will undermine hours of work, then that becomes a problem.   And don't even get me started on the final dungeon. There are so many design decisions (like rendering your characters illegible for future expeditions, to name one) that are some high grade cow manure, and exemplarly of just how un-fun the game has become.  I guess I'm more disappointed than anything else. There are so many aspects of this game that I love, and that I'm sure other players who are thinking about buying this game will love too. The aesthetic of this game is absolutely phenomenal, the writing is superb, the gameplay is innovative, and there are some genuinely great features. But somewhere along the line, the game has become less about facing off against the eldritch horrors and pulling victory from the jaws of defeat, and more about not losing horribly. It has gone from ‘tough, but fair’ to ‘grueling and frustrating’.  Edit: For those of you who are interested, I effectively did three runs of the game. The first I started back in March which went on for roughly 30 hours, in which time I'd completed all the available content. I did a second, much shorter one in mid July that lasted about 20 hours in which I only got about half way through bosses. I started a third one, intended to be my final run of the game, in late October, which took me 45 hours to reach about three-quarters of the way to the end game.  This should help show just how much of a grind this game has become",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Just when I thought I was finished with gaming, this gem comes out. In a gaming universe now littered with embarrassingly amateurish 'shovelware,' insipid 'AAA' titles that usually amount to little more than more of the same with minor tweaks (but with eye-bleeding super-realistic graphics that require mega-GPUs to get 25 fps - another sad trend as of late), and just plain scams where devs promise one thing, deliver another, and disappear into the ether with your cash, a game like Darkest Dungeon (DD) gives me hope that my once favorite hobby has some life in it yet.  What is amazing is that DD treads a well-worn road. At its heart, DD is just another 'roguelike' dungeon crawler. But what elevates DD to its own lofty pedestal is a simple question: would professional dungeon crawlers develop PTSD? At first, you laugh at the idea. But then you stop and think about it. Given how your typical fantasy dungeon crawl not only involves the type of brutal combat that any modern soldier would understand, but also a host of horrors - such as demons, giant spiders, and other abominations- on top of THAT, the answer would seem to be: oh heck yeah. I guess they really would!  That is the heart of Darkest Dungeon.   Darkest Dungeon puts the player not just in charge of clearing dungeons, but also of managing the mental health of their assailed heroes. In DD, the player must send teams of four adventurers (whom come from a nicely varied assortment of classes) to clear dungeons from around half a dozen thematic designs (ruins, warrens, etc.). This part of the game is great fun. Resembling a side-scroller, your adventurers, whom are brought to life with some wonderfully hand drawn artistry reminiscient of a Brothers Grimm fairytale, clear out a series of rooms and passages (randomly generated and populated with monsters, traps and loot, of course) in a dungeon of various sizes, some so big that your team will need to camp inside a few times. Such moments are a lot of fun as it involves its own unique gameplay of recuperation and campsite chatter. Battle is handled in a wonderful turn-based fashion (love it; so glad to see devs getting away from click-fest RTS games) with both sides using their weapons and skills to strike each other down, something wonderfully enhanced by a narrator who comments on the action with a voice right out of, yes!, a Grimm's fairytale. But here is the important kicker: as your adventurers explore and battle their way through a dungeon, the game tracks stress points individually. So, for example, if your man-at-arms suffers a critical hit at the hand of a foe, his stress level will go up, as might the stress of the other party members. On the other hand, if he deals a devastating riposte, his stress might go down, and so on. If stress accumulates to a certain degree, the adventurer might have a mental break. It is here that the game begins to resemble Crusader Kings 2 in that each adventurer can accumulate a mix of up to a dozen vices and virtues that will affect their performance. So, that man-at-arms who was almost killed might become a coward when he has his mental break, something that might debuff his stats or make him miss a turn. Or, maybe he overcomes his fear and gets a virtue instead: he becomes heroic and urges his party to fight harder, reducing stress for all and buffing combat stats. See how it works? It is quite fun and adds a wonderful novelty to the game! But be warned: if your adventurer becomes too stressed, he can actually die of a heartattack!   Speaking of heartattacks, that is what might happen to the gamer when he loses one of his star adventurers to permadeath. Yeah, this game has that. Personally, I love permadeath because nothing ruins a tale of adventuring heroism when the player can just 'save and restore.' Face it: S&amp;R is just immortality by another name. How can there be true heroism if the hero is never truly at risk? But that is just my two cents. Be that as it may, this game has permadeath, so be prepared to lose some of your best players to the evil machninations of the 'random number generator' that governs many aspects of this game. If you hate such mechanics, than this game is not for you.   What happens when your adventurers leave a dungeon, assuming they survive? Here, the game takes on an XCOM-like factor where base management comes into play. In between dungeon crawls, the player can send his adventurers out with bags of gold to help them blow off steam in six different ways, from getting drunk, to praying at the abbey. Of course, this takes these adventurers out of the game for at least a week - I say 'at least a week' becayse random events occasionally trigger where, say, your knight gets drunk and wanders the town for two weeks in a state of inebriation! LOL! That actually happened to one of my adventurers. Not only did he go AWOL for an extra week, be he lost the magic trinket I gave him! Hence, the player needs to have a deep bench of adventurers to keep the gaming moving along, something that is not initially difficult as the local stage coach brings in a steady supply of new victi...er, adventurers.   In addition to managing the stress of your bench, you can also train new skills, upgrade armor and weapons, upgrade facilities, treat the mental and physical ailments your adventurers acquire in the darkest dungeons, and select the next adventure and get kitted out for it.   And that is pretty much the basics of the game in a nutshell. Again, with the exception of the stress factor, nothing revolutionary. But RedHook, with feedback from the community (this is EA done right!), applied so much thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and ol' fashioned love to their project that what has emerged out the other end may well be Game of the Year material for the PC. Frankly, it has been a very long time since I have so thoroughly enjoyed a game. With the devs already promising a new class of adventurer as well as 'town events' in the near future gratis - the town does need some enlivening as it feels a little static and dull at times, so I am glad to hear this - I think the Darkest Dungeon has a VERY bright future ahead of it. It certainly has already rocketed to the top of my favorite games list!",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"'There can be no hope in this hell... no hope at all.' - The Ancestor.  Now that the game is released and I have played it in the... 'finished' state - I can say that I am quite disappointed. Sure, the difficulty is fine and entertaining, but only for so long: all hero upgrades feel absolutely underwhelming. Now, this might not be obvious at the start, because properly upgraded and geared heroes can easily chew through any easy and medium dungeons. But then come the lvl 5 champion ones... and with them comes utter disaster as monsters start to show up with abominable amounts of PROT(while we still have only TWO heroes who can counter this), SPD and additional effects to their attacks. At this point your tactics and overall preparedness barely matter as everything is purely in the hands of the game: the dice will decide your fate and in the final stages they are loaded against you.  Pros: - Stunning and hauntingly beautiful art, music and atmosphere.  - One superb, amazing narrator.  Cons: - Insane difficulty spike near game end without any reasonable means to offset it, tactics will only get you so far. - Heroes actually start to feel weak as the game progresses: without a crit - you're very likely to end in the gutter. I really don't want to complain, but I simply fail to justify the reason why some filthy pigs, skeletons. bandits and mushroom abominations all have PROT, while my lvl 5 armour, even on Crusader and Man-at-Arms who actually wear plate, provides NONE of it. - It feels terribly grindy. The amount of various relics required, especially Deeds, is atrocious. The amount of gold necessary for upgrades and the quality of upgrades themselves is DISGUSTING. - The game actually ENCOURAGES you to sacrifice your first best group of heroes, as they will accumulate EXP faster than gear and at some point will not be able to handle the dungeons appropriate for them.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Great game! It easily became one of my most favorite games. It has all the elements I love in video games: turn based strategy, RPG, dark gothic style, team and town management, random loot, medieval time, no fairy tale magic, random generated levels, perma death and customization of characters. I love this game so much that I created my fan made comic book, please check them out:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386523966   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515275078   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428958000 ",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"It's a tough game to review, now that's it out of early access. Ideally I'd give it a neutral recommendation, but since I can't it's going to be not recommended. Why?   - The game evolved very little since ea started. They added more stuff (heroes, enemies), sure, but they didn't really add more depth or refine the game mechanics in any meaningful way.   - The grind. And this is coming from someone who can take a lot of grind in games. This is the worst kind of grind, the grind without any meaningful progress in sight. Most of the game you'll be doing the same medium length missions over and over again to grind gold, deeds and XP, in fact you HAVE TO beat every mission a number of times before a boss fight unlocks. Then each boss has to be killed 3 times (after you fill the GRIND BAR 3 times, obviously). Much like your heroes, the bosses don't get any new skills, they just get stat buffs. Then you beat the final dungeon. That's it. If you cut all the fat the game could be beaten in 20-30 missions, without repeating the same scouting quest 20 times and spending 526 deeds to improve the bar in your village. In fact it would've been better that way.   - Incredibly shallow game mechanics. Stress? It was promised to be a core mechanics of the game and it's just another healthbar with random effects at break points. Afflictions? Way too easy to remove. Hero skills? Just bigger numbers from start to finish. Equipment? Again bigger numbers, zero variety. Trinkets? Take the ones that improve the stat you want, sell the rest. Exploration? Doesn't exist. Combat tactics? Shoot the eldritch horror until it dies.   - Difficulty. The game seems very difficult at first, but it's an illusion, once you learn to game the system and proper party composition it gets trivial. You'll still lose a hero or be forced to abandon a mission every now and then (the game is RNG heavy), but because the game has no fail-state (!) you're only limited by how much grind you can take.   - Now that's it out of ea, I can say that some things seem like placeholders. The hunger mechanic is a joke. Dungeons are mapped from the start (!). Torchlight system is just tedium. Many skills and trinket are complete garbage and essentially serve as a newbie trap. Corpses don't add to the difficulty or tactics, they just prolong fights and look stupid. I could go on, but these are nitpicks that wouldn't matter if the core gameplay had more depth to it.  What's good about it? The atmosphere, graphics and narration are excellent. Gameplay... not so much. It's not completely terrible, but they underdelivered, concentrating on meaningless fluff like corpses, heart attacks and fight prolonging penalties instead of adding some choice and depth to gameplay. It's a 5/10 game, if you get it for $10 or less, you might have fun for your money, but that's all it is. A shame, really. ",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Darkest Dungeon in the first 20hrs of play.....is exactly the same as Darkest Dungeon in the 100th hour of play- there is enough class complexity and tactical depth for to be very engaging early but this just doesn't last.  Had I quit after the first 20hrs I would have been left with a strongly positive impression. Unfortunately, as a completionist, I wanted to see the game finished- and thats when I found myself bogged down in an grind of repetitive encounters and contrived hurdles that function only to lengthen, not enhance, the core campaign.  While the class depth and balance is very good it is a shame that the combat system is so limited and unimaginative- this is a game that I played, almost in its entirety, with the sound off while watching movies and documentaries.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"This game starts out being difficult in a really fair and interesting way, but that thread runs out. Harsh but meaningful progression gives way to what you try to tell yourself is not tedium but which absolutely is.  If you're the type of person who will only play the first few hours of something regardless, go ahead and get this. It's a ton of fun initially, and the production quality is outstanding.  But if you get it into your head that you actually want to finish this thing, Darkest Dungeon is a huge disappointment.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I love this game. I've nearly beaten it, it has been very fun. But I can't recommend it in it's current state. It has obviously had a lot of work put into it, but it still needs a lot of work. My main complaint is that for a game that was created with the idea in mind of introducing the player to a world of realism(with fantacy Lovecraftian Eldritch horror themes), of the human mind and body being put to the test and the results of doing so, for some reason they decided the way to do this was with RNG deciding the mechanics they so heavily wanted to emphasize: permadeath and afflictions.  PROS:   +Very well done visually.   +Sound effects, narration, and music are great.  +Strategy based gameplay with many party and skill combinations to use.  +Difficult in a satisfying way (usually).  CONS:  -Too heavily dependant on RNG. Mechanics that are the main focus of the game, such as permanent death (Deathblow at Death's Door) and how heroes react to stress(Affliction/Virtue), are entirely up to chance. I'm fine with RNG when it's used to create the quests, but the combat and progress in general is too heavily dependant on it. To add on to this, the game actually becomes more RNG dependant as you progress. Critical Hits become more common and effects decided by RNG (bleed, blight, disease, debuffs, move) become more common.   -A total grindfest. Seriously. It takes SO LONG to raise heroes to be able to have any chance at surviving the LVL 6 Darkest Dungeon missions. Heroes come with, and gain throughout their quest through RNG, various negative quirks that render them useless against the extremely unforgiving stress and health damage of the late game enemies. So you have to grind low level dark runs, to gain enough gold to afford the treatments to cure their quirks, to make your higher level heroes even usable.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"SNAPSHOT A Lovecraftian game built to mirror the stress and sanity loss between the player and the characters in the game.  OVERALL - 6 / 10  PROS + great atmosphere / aesthetics + satisfying meta progression  CONS - huge emphasis on very poor RNG - game is balanced heavily against the player early on - gameplay gets repetitive quickly  DETAILS I'm going to say this up front: I save scummed the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, and I don't feel one iota of remorse. Overall, the game has a lot of fun elements to it, but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices, mostly those that were added post-alpha. Pre-alpha the game was a lot of fun, often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it. Post-alpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up. The game is built to be challenging, but what Darkest Dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions: the more you play, the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of RNG you have to rely on.  Darkest Dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck, which only gets worse the longer you play. The game is built to put the PCs into a dying state quickly and often, which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic. Introduced sometime after alpha, and a longstanding point of contention, heart attacks cause a PC to instantly enter a dying state, regardless of health, or die permanently if they are already dying. Because of this, often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party, regardless of how well you are doing.  Sanity loss for PCs leads to afflictions, which basically makes the given PC suicidal for the rest of the dungeon. More often than not an afflicted PC will skip their turn, refuse healing, shift the party order around, or somehow injure or debuff themselves. It would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things, or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen, but instead they often happen in succession, which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction, and the cycle repeats. This quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75% of your turns are either skipped or used to re-arrange heroes because they can't do anything else (not even defend). This is, in short, not fun whatsoever.  Aside from the in-dungeon frustrations, the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon, with PCs claiming that they 'wouldn't learn anything from the experience', or some other ridiculous reasoning. This is actually probably my biggest gripe, even moreso than heart attacks. This level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon. Unfortunately, it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced, so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again, re-living the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome.  Overall, I do like Darkest Dungeon, when the dice are in my favor. When they aren't (which is ~75% of the time, it seems), the game is just an unending stream of frustration. The thrill, charm, and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in pre-alpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the post-launch changes, and given that I play games to relieve stress and have fun, this is the opposite of the desired result. As such I cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it, however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"A lot of this game's atmosphere will suck you in, but the tragic truth is that this is a game of luck. There are far too many instances where the RNG comes into play and they all involve your party being killed.   The thing is, none of those elements can be fixed with a patch. The stress levels of your heroes will not be able to recover within a reasonable amount of time, the healing techniques are sparse and can be randomly refused by your heroes. The roguelike gameplay means that you may spend a half hour sprawling through a dungeon getting lower on supplies until you happen upon the objective by luck.   This game may be fun for some, but the tragedy is that most of the problems with this game are because of incompetent design. To criticize the amount of luck involved with the game is to risk being told to 'git gud'.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Genre - Roguelike Gothic Fantasy  I waited until the full release to post a review as there were a few key things missing from early access like achievements. Now after playing the game some more I can safely recommend it.   Although it is roguelike it plays as a side scrolling dungeon crawler with parties of four. You are situated in a village allowing for weapon and skill upgrades as well as the recruiting of new adventurers (expect some to die along the way). There are quite varied classes, although maybe another tyoe of party healer is required, as there are only two classes that do this role effectively. As you complete each dungeon you get heirlooms, these can then be used to upgrade your village amenites. You can choose out of a few areas at once with bosses along the way to fight, meaning you won't get stuck in just one area with the smae baddies for ages. The combat can be challenging but not impossible (as far as I know, I am still near the start).  What makes this game stand out is the stress effect on your characters as you explore each dungeon. Some are positive but most are negative. For instance they might become abusive to other adventurers increasing their stress or paranoid and avoid being healed etc. To help with this you use the tavern or the abbey to calm them down. Meaning you will constantly be rotating your party for each mission. There are also disease effects to account for and sometimes personal preference like being god fearing etc.  The art style itself is fairly unique and very atmospheric and the voice acting of the plot driver is fantastic.  It is a fun game that pushes the boundaries of the genre and can be played in short doses with persistent progression to your village and characters, if they survive that is...",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"It's very easy to get involved into the dark, hopeless and grim atmosphere this game manages to create thanks to the excellent art with a very well-fitting choice of colours and to the immersive musics and FX. I never opened the settings menu to enable or disable game mechanics, because I think this game should be experimented in an artistic and sensorial way, not in a rational one (criticizing mechanics and so on).  This game is about the fragile human psyche and the illusion of faith and earthly pleasures used as a placebo in a desperate attempt to avoid its fracture. Strategy is nothing when Fate itself is against you, and this is represented by a lot of game statistics being expressed by percentages. Human skill is useless against timeless horrors: one can only hope to succeed out of a burst of good luck. This game is capable of keeping constantly high my level of anxiety during missions (with even victory resulting in a somewhat negative situation... followed by all the mental and physical consequences the heroes must face) and my level of discouragement while managing the hamlet (with all the heroes getting sick, mad, asking not to be sent again down there...)  Maybe I like this game because it 'sees' life as I do: I'm quite pessimist, thus I think that chances are always against me, hope is just a childish feeling to me (but I'm not completely hopeless), I'm stubborn and tend to recover from setbacks out of pride. But I'm prone to frustration too, so I greatly dislike unfair games, like Darkest Dungeon can be quite often...  I could not get frustrated by it till now though, like I could easily get by a bad serie of 'aseptic' dice rolls for example: in fact in Darkest Dungeon things go terribly wrong in such a dramatic end elegant way that all I can think about is only the epicness of my defeat, with the music that becomes more and more pressing and anxiogenic as the hope of victory fades away...  I admit it: Sometimes I ragequit, sometimes I facepalmed, some other times I watched the screen in disappoint and disbelief... as if I really was In that dungeon with those poor souls called 'heroes' by some townsfolk, and surrendered like them to some nasty mental derangement for just a second...  This game awakened in me again the fear of bosses, because they're overpowered and there is permadeath. Characters are designed to be anti-heroes, and this concept reaches its apotheosis when a pious paladin succumbs to his inner selfishness and show himself as the frail human he actually is. And what should that paladin think when a distrusted abomination reacts to his stress with virtue and valor instead (a rare event indeed)?  As you have seen, I have not covered any technical aspect in this review because I think that If you look for the gameplay, mechanics or strategy aspects in this game... well this is not the game for you.  Edit, November 2016: voted Darkest Dungeon for Autumn sales awards",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"After more than twenty hours of gameplay, I have to come to terms with the fact that this game is not for me - which is not the same as saying Darkest Dungeon is bad. It is not a bad game, but I guess it targets a player niche I’m not part of. And that is a shame, because I loved most things about it - the setting, the writing, the atmosphere, the art, and plenty of the gameplay mechanics. I sincerely wanted to see this one to its end. What dissuaded me from doing so was what I consider a serious imbalance between reward and frustration within the game - and I don’t mind difficult games, having played through FTL countless times as well as half the Souls series. What I’m not willing to deal with is how easily you can lose characters (or even have your party wiped out) despite hours of power playing, upgrading and strategizing. The challenge borders on the unfair, but fans of the game seem to revel in that (thus I do not count myself among the game’s target public). And yes, I’d been warned that I’d lose entire parties, that my favorite characters would die, etc. Still, because every other aspect of the game enticed me, I gave it a try - and now I can say, without prejudice and with pain in my heart, that the mandatory grind of Darkest Dungeon is not worth the time and aggravation it would take to beat the game. C’est la vie.  Edit: It has been interesting to watch the reaction of Darkest Dunegon fans to negative reviews, most of which come in the form of one (or a variation) of the following:  (a) 'Too hard? Git gud noob!!1!' My reply: It's not that hard, once you learn how to optimize your parties. But that is part of the problem: In order to have a chance, you need optimization, and that leads to a joyless, variety-free grind in spite of all the interesting classes and abilities.   (b) 'Only 20 hours? Cr4p review.' My reply: Much like the previous case, this translates into 'waah waah you dislike my favorite game, you suck!', which is both immature and untrue. Along the same lines, you'll see people saying 'this game is easy if you take the time to actually learn it', and to these people I say: Not everyone has (or is willing to spend) 100 hours to memorize game patterns, and not all reviewers should be expected to spend that long on the game before they are allowed to give their opinion. Please learn to cope with disagreement. FACT: Despite all its qualities (and there are many!), this game is grindy as hell, and dishes out massive doses of frustration to boot. Review readers will be interested in learning this, and reviews which contain this information are useful. Crying 'Cr4p review' only because of the red thumb down makes you a whiny fanboy.   (c) 'This game is not supposed to make you feel good.' My reply: If this is an honest statement, then we play games for very different reasons - which is fine. Granted: there are games which inspire a range of emotions both positive and negative in a way that is ultimately rewarding, but Darkest Dungeon is not one of them. And anyway, I already spend too many hours on ONE grindy game that gives me more than my fair share of grief and frustration. It's called 'life', which has a mandatory mini-game called 'work'. Don't judge me for enjoying a little variety.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"The overall package of Darkest Dungeon is very polished. Great visual design, audio, the whole thing.  But in attempts to promote their game as 'hardest of the hardcore', the devs basically skew their own stats against the player in calculations.  When at 60+ Dodge I dodge nothing, there is something clearly ♥♥♥♥ed up with the RNG numbers. I have seen mobs with far lower Dodge dance around my guys' blows. This includes an undead bloated corpse.  I'm sorry, but no. If you want your stat-based super-tough hardcore game, you bloody well make those numbers on my statscreen mean something.  Give me percentages, PROPER percentages, don't hide it behind arbitrary numbers. SHOW me the chance to hit instead of seperating Dodge and Miss chance. How exactly am I to know you are fair if you deliberately obscure numbers?  Maybe that new update with the new mode would help.  But they should come out and say it, that 'mode' is an actual proper balance patch.",-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I'll start with a warning: If you dislike RNG and it making a big difference, you might wanna skip this game. Even with the right tactics, some well-geared characters and a lot of experience, some encounters might still get your favorite adventurers killed. You should be aware of this, and if you hate having some very unhappy rolls on attacks, then this might be very frustrating.  Now... I at first wasn't very interest in DD, but a review and stream by TB made me change my mind and try it. And I was captivated quickly. The game is a LOT of fun. The graphics and animations are very simple, but also, very stylish, so they have character and are nice to look at. The atmosphere is great. There is a certain Lovecraftian vibe to things (not only because madness can become a real problem for your adventurers), and the narrator does SUCH a great job (BTW, check out his readings of HPL-stories, such a cool experience).  Even with a lot of training, these dungeons will be risky for your guys. Bad RNG on heals (instead of, say, 8 points, you get 0 or 1 points, which means you kinda lost a turn) or damage (sometimes, you are THAT close to killing a mob, but then, 2-3 of your guys actually MISS, and you actually end up losing), debuffs like selfishness (your character might snag loot for himself), or paranoia (he or she might actually REFUSE to be healed) etc.  I did like the darkness-mechanic. There are advantages and disadvantages to letting the light go dim or using torches to get to 100 light. With this mechanic, you kinda pick how you wanna approach the dungeon, a little bit like controlling the difficulty level yourself (not that it is a cakewalk if you spam torches, mind you!), and the increased rewards you get for fights at low light levels come with increased risks too.  So, you may ask, why do people play this? Are we all out for punishment? No! The game is just very addictive in that 'Come on, just one more quick dungeon before I head to bed... whoops, it's 3 AM?!?!' way. It is challenging, it will often feel unfair, but boy, winning battles and completing dungeons feels so very satisfying. You start to care about your chars (and there is an achievement about beating the final boss with the chars you get at the beginning of the game), especially if you name them yourself.  A guide might help you get started, as money will be an issue (supplies are expensive, so you wanna pick carefully what to take along), but even if you just dive in and go trial and error, you will learn what to do. Talking about that, here is one complaint I have: The supplies and treatments IMO are TOO expensive. Even when you clear out tons of tough dungeons, you might have low funds due to the prize of upgrades to your buildings, treatments and supplies like bandages and torches. Sure, those supplies shouldnt be so cheap or plentiful that you can spam them at all times, but then, simply limit the amount you can get more. I didn't mind all the bad luck with the RNG and losing fights I thought I'd rather easily win, but I found those prizes frustrating, and IMO, they should be lowered at least a tiny bit.  Other than that: It's a great, tactical game, some fights will have you bite your nails, sometimes you will feel disappointed, especially when losing a character you leveled up. The game will eventually become kinda grindy, but at that point, you could just play it casually, like doing half an hour or so and then returning later.  Pros: - Atmospheric - Simple, but unique graphics and animations - Great narrator voice - Challenging - You get to choose your ability-loadout - Very satisfying when you beat a boss or dungeon...  CONS ...and very frustrating when they beat YOU - Expensive supplies - Expensive treatment to get rid of debuffs and stuff - Can get grindy - Not recommended if you hate losing RNG rolls even when your characters are leveled and equipped with good gear - Can feel a bit repetitive  Great game... watch some playthroughs and maybe a guide, and then decide for yourself. I thoroughly enjoy the game!",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Some Good, Some Bad  The general gameplay is pretty decent, a turn-based dungeon explorer. That said, there's a lot of elements that are really just frustrating to deal with. The stress system, while sometimes fun (It feels pretty awesome when you hit 100 stress and your character gets a heroic bonus instead of crumbling under the stress like the majority of characters do) is more annoying than anything. When maximum stress hits the character has a heart attack, dropping their health to zero and debuffing them for the remainder of the dungeon, which can be a group killing experience. To avoid this you're expected to 'treat' the character's stress by leaving them in the local bar or church while you go on your next adventure. This leads to a lot of characters leveling up at different rates. This wouldn't be too bad, but there's invisible barriers between characters of certain levels. For instance, level 3 characters can't embark with level 2 characters. This causes problems where the only characters available on your roster are two level 3s, and two level 2s, because everyone else is healing from stress or illness. Except you can't embark with that group, because theyre separate level groups. So what do you do? Well, you can either take a highly stressed character out of the bar or church because you need some lower leveled guys to adventure with to get some people up to level 3. I realize its supposed to be a matter of how to manage the team, but it's more frustrating than anything. A high stressed character IS going to have a heart attack during the dungeon and ruin the run, and dismissing them to hire a new recruit is just really annoying.   Then there's the spontaneous difficulty spikes. For instance one dungeon, suggested for level 1 characters, asks you to kill a specific character, a 'boss'. The 'boss' character all of a sudden is able to knock two characters down to 1 health in one attack, and gets multiple attack turns in one round. Meanwhile all before this I had been playing level 1 dungeons, others with boss characters that were nowhere near this difficulty. It's just ridiculous, because there's no reason or expectation of such power in a level 1 dungeon.  There's also the low drop rates of gold, which you need to spend more and more of on supplies just to survive the dungeon, but then also need to use to upgrade characters and heal their stress and ailments. There's barely enough money to go around, which makes advancing characters a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially when they'll just die to an encounter with an enemy like I mentioned in the last paragraph.   Overall, I find the game frustrating, but there are redeeming aspects, like having a solid team making dungeons a challenging, but rewarding experience (but like I mentioned with the level-tier separations that can get messed up really quickly) I'd recommend it to people that like repeating tedious elements, because you will be losing characters, and re-running the same dungeons to level up new characters again. I've read that the game is more of a team-management game than a dungeon crawler, which kind of rings true. The important part of the game seems to be more in how you handle healing characters and the meager funds you get. If you're into that aspect, and dont care that much about whether your characters survive in the long run then you might like the game. I feel the game is misrepresented as a dungeon crawler RPG, and thats only a part of the game, which is more often frustrating than enjoyable. If all you want is to dungeon crawl, a different game might be more up your ally. If you want to manage your team of weaklings, and can accept that most of them are going to die then you might like the game.  Generally, I don't recommend the game, because I don't think it appeals to a wide audience and most people are going to go into it expecting an experience much different than what it actually is, but if you fall within a specific niche of gamers that prefer team-management games and grim-dark fantasy you might be one of the people that really like Darkest dungeon.",-1,1

Kinda like my ex. But that's what makes the game so incredibly good: It's incredibly DARK. Your enemies are wretched creatures, mad, undead or the disgusting outcomes of the most horrible experiments since that one time when Metallica decided to make an album with Lou Reed.Your 'heroes' are a band of outcasts, fight for their own causes, have wierd manias and personalities, go mad and endanger all that you have been working for. There is NO SAVE HAVEN! When you come back to town with your decimated party, your B-team that was recovering from the last quest, has turned into a band of PTSD-ridden wierdos. Your Crusader has run off with a hooker, the Bandit is hungover, the Nun has an STD and the jester gambled away all your money. And then there is also your Plague doctor, who refuses to leave the local church and the Graverobber who has become addicted to more substances than Lindsey Lohan. Now pick your four favourite adventurers and watch them die in the dungeon, just because one of them got a disease, because he thought that half-rotten corpse over there was still edible. Or because your Arbalest went mad and wanted to try his crossbow from the front ranks, or because you did not bring enough torches, or because you didn't retreat that harsh battle, or because you took the wrong turn... This game is UNFORGIVING, the most trivial mistake or wrong decision can cost you your whole team. But that's what makes it still interresting after several weeks strolling through the very repetetive dungeons, doing the same old quests. Every single battle can turn the tide.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"  At first, I thought the negative reviews on this game were unfair. Complaining about the grind or RNG? It was like these people had never played a roguelike before. However, after sinking close to 100 hours on this game, I sadly have to agree with their sentiments.  This game's atmosphere is excellent. Its presentation is top-notch. The actual gameplay is intuitive yet complex (and so, of course, incredibly fun). It really does quite a bit right.   But the game demands an incredible amount of time. And considering the many, many different ways it can set you back, it feels like a waste rather than an investment. A single hero's death can set you back hours. Retreating from a quest--usually a necessary and reasonable precaution--becomes an infuriating experience after you've spent the last hour and a half trying to chase down an objective that spawned at the very end of a very long map. Random town events can hinder--or even undo--your progress. Shoot, even the mechanics behind completing the eponymous Darkest Dungeon--which I will keep relatively unspoiled--is geared to extending the already extremely long grind.  This game takes skill, without question. Many mishaps after embark that appear like the cruel hand of RNGesus can actually be traced to small--often ostensibly innocuous--errors of judgment earlier along the adventure. However, like any game involving chance, sometimes luck isn't on your side. And RNGesus help you when it's not.   Really, I feel this is a great game, but it is also a game that overstays its welcome (in addition to eating all your food, spilling chili on your carpet, and stealing your last $20.00 bill from the wallet you had left on the counter).",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Some other reviewers have done a great job highlighting the game's quality. I may only focus on arguing with the common negative arguments.     1. 'Only RNG ! No skill !'   Rules and RNG are tough and you need to plan carefully and know when to withdraw. Leave the loot, spend much less to fix the characters ; use the extra left to harden them instead. Discipline, planning, analysis are mandatory when approaching late game. Greed == Casulaties + Bankrupt     2. 'It's mostly grind, hence dull'   Not untrue. But art quality and the plenty variable parameters make things fresh and surprising on most runs. I personally hate grinding-based gameplay, but this game doesn't feel like that to me.     3. 'I am on Windows 10 and it keeps crashing'   TL;DR: Don't be too tough on that one, W10 made many older things break.  Please consider in your reviews the game initially targetted Windows 7/8 (runs fine on 7 BTW) and many prior-existing games and software titles are no longer (and still not) stable on Windows 10 as of writing. Microsoft made some weird/aggressive choices addressing the retrocompatibility with Win8/7. One of those apparently being: the user is now a software tester.  What that really means here, is that the devs have to spend extra bucks on working around 'novelties' on W10, rather than making new contents or fixing their own bugs.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Out of the hundreds of games I played for the last 20-25 years few games made me feel the thrill and rush of experiencing something new, and yet here this game accomplishes the same sensation after all these years. But there is a catch, you will surely have lots of fun for the first 10 to 20 hours and after a while as you progress in the game your fun will diminish slowly and convert to frustration as you reach end game content. The game mechanics for the last dungeon (Darkest Dungeon) are what gamers has been complaining about. I have to admit that they are right, the game turns to be an absolute grinding cycle in the end.  I have started new games several times just to fiddle with different team compositions, different trinkets and different sets of skills. After all this hours of deep playing into the game I can surely say; Yes there are balance issues, and surely the end game grinding kills the fun out of it but if you ignore the last dungeon (at least until the devs decide to rebalance or change it) you are definitely looking at a gem.  Ps: The narration (although it gets repetitive after a while) is simply astonishing. I have to admit that I may have watched the intro at least a dozen times and started at least half a dozen new games just to watch the beginning cinematic :)",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"This game starts off great but becomes borderline unplayable mid- to late game.   Artstyle, narration and atmosphere are pretty much 10/10 and the first maybe 10-20 hours of the game (though I'm generally a slow player) are a ton of fun. The dungeons are hard but also rewarding and interesting, your characters grow or die, develop their individual traits and get on your nerves with their quirks (in a good way).   The fun ends once your characters level up to the higher quest tiers. There are level 1, 3, 5 and with the Darkest Dungeon presumably level 6 quests. Once your characters reach the respective level, they refuse to go on lower level quests, which generally would be fine. The problem is that the difficulty scaling from one tier to the other is insane and level ups themselves don't do anything for the characters. You will therefore be massively 'underleveled', if you haven't been extremely successfull in upgrading your guild and your smithy and getting loads of money to then actually upgrade your heroes. You can then either send your best guys on runs they're not prepared for and either see them die or spend most of the money you get on their recovery OR you grind ridiculously small rewards with new arrivals.   A lot of people are complaining about the RNG but I honestly didn't have any issues with that. Yes, sometimes it can feel unfair and your party gets ♥♥♥♥ed because of a series of terrible rolls, but other times you'll see them destroy a boss with him barely being able to get a hit in, so... yeah, that's RNG for you.   What really ruins this game for me is its insane difficulty scaling and artificially stretched length. I have started a couple of runs and have never gotten past the level 3 quests. To be fair, I can be pretty bad at video games but it seems like a lot of people are having similar experiences, so I don't think it's just entirely that.   The game still has a lot of good elements and I can't say I completely advice people not to buy it. It's just that actually finishing it is an enormous pain in the ♥♥♥ and I'd reckon most people won't actually see the end if they're not extremely determined and have a very high tolerance for frustration.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Beyond the artistic merits, I was largely unimpressed.  The game is inexplicably punishing to the point of frustration. Here me out. I am no meek gamer in the strategy world. I have completed Shogun 2 on Legendary and Xcom on Impossible Iron-man. I can take the beatings if the game world and mechanics make sense, and I get a feeling that I am contributing to my goal.  In Darkest Dungeon there is one difficulty. I suppose the designers have tried to incorporate what is known as cognitive flow in game theory [1], by allowing your to choose the level of dungeon you enter with your party. You can roughly match your party to a suitable dungeon in level-wise as well as tactics wise (if you go ruins, don’t take bleed damage, for one example).  Then it becomes apparent that the designers have know idea what they are doing and then BREAK the cognitive flow by not allowing you to 'game the game'. You can't take a level 3 character into a level 1 dungeon. You can't use your 'battle' skills outside of battle, but then you can't take an extra 2-3 rounds in battle to heal wounds and stress... because the game will punish you with more stress for bothering to try. Entering a level 5 dungeon is less like a move from 3 to 5, and more like a move from 3 to 10 if you know what I mean.  Beyond the obvious imbalance in the game, the game will then double and triple punish you with the inane random dice that I wonder why even try in the first place? It feels like my skill and knowledge of the game becomes more irreverent the higher the dungeon level. Ironically the stress attacks in the game cause real stress to the player -- that is they are so frequent and critically boosted that it causes no-end to frustrations. Where is the fun lads?  Minor gripes include the carry space is far too small for the amount of item types in the game, forcing more contrived choices with the only goal of annoying me further. There is not enough gold earned in the game, used for nearly everything useful. There are too many heirloom item drops in the game (used to unlock and build up your town).  I am left to assume that the refusal to balance the game properly and provide either adequate difficulty modes or a proper working cognitive game flow, is a sign of artificially inflating the playtime of the title. Taken into account the annoying slow pop-ups that lock the control on the party, the tedious animation loops, and the drawn out combat; all of which compound to my suspicions.  I hope with their financial success, they make another game and address these issues forthwith, but for me I didn't like this game despite really trying and pouring 50 hours into it. This is the counter point to looking for 'long games' to use as an example of 'good games'. This is the same problem with games like Counter Strike GO; were I clocked up 200 hours before a realisation of 'WTF am I doing'; I didn't actually enjoy nearly all of my time in those worlds. To me, they will be be forgotten and never explored again.  What both these titles have in common is the overuse of catchy gimmicks in game-play and exploit this fully with shallow quest/rewards. The length of the game is not equal to the quality of my enjoyment. I was annoyed, frustrated, bored and wishing I would just find a better game to play.

But if you have hair on both heads you will recognize it for what it is - a casual grinder/walking simulator that endlessly copy pastes palette swaps of the same few enemies and areas and bosses and everything else. This is why even the shills don't bother advocating the positive qualities, it doesn't have any. All they have is mindless attacks at any critics, which you will start seeing here shortly.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"This game has enormous potential, all of which is ruined by the combination of its two biggest weaknesses: RNG and lvl 5 dungeons.  Starting off the game, it will most likely feel difficult for most people, however, after a few introductory dungeons, you're gonna get a feel for the general strategy the game forces upon you. All is going fine and dandy (except for a few bosses), until you get to the max level (lvl 5) dungeons, which provide the pre-endgame of Darkest Dungeon.  This is where the intro screen isntructions of the game come in at full force. You're not trying to beat a dungeon, you're trying to get through it by the skin of your teeth, almost always losing at least one hero. You are at the mercy of RNGsus, praying so that the enemy unit doesn't crit you twice in a row, instantly resulting in death if you fail your death's door check.  I've put over 80 hours into this game. I've read through most of the wiki, I watch youtubers on a daily basis who mostly play this game. I haven't even reached the final dungeon. You might say 'well, git gud', but herein lies the other big issue with this game. The easiest comparison you could make is with Dark Souls: both games are extremely challenging, provide little to no information for the player, and at points seem completely unfair. The biggest difference is that in Dark Souls, most deaths that occur, can be attributed to misplays on the player's side. Here, most of my failed dungeons come from being chain-critted in the second fight of a long dungeon. At best, you're trying to minimalize the losses you're going to suffer at level 5. I've always liked challenging games, but this one is simply unfair.  The new town events somehow, after the community's outrage, emphasize these weaknesses even more (RNG playing a huge part in your success). I'm baffled by the fact that not only does the developer not give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the biggest problems with an otherwise extremely promising game, they even boost those issues further in newer content.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Grade: A Time Play: 60 hours (mostly offline)  I want to state first that Darkest Dungeon is far and away the best and most complete early access game that I have played. The systems are basically finished, with the team mostly just fine tuning now. The art is fantastic and imaginative, both with characters and environments, There is plenty to do. The game is only really missing the final two areas and and a handful of character classes, which should be arriving shortly.  DD is a hard game. but it has an interesting fallback: heroes are free. You can recruit them endlessly, so it is nearly impossible to actually fail. Which is good because nasty things lurk in the depths. If you have read H.P. Lovecrafts works (and you should), then this will seem very familiar in a good way! Much like Lovecraft's protagonists, your heroes will mostly end their stories by going insane and dying.  This is one of the most interesting facets of the game: stress. In DD, your heroes are vulnerable and scared. They don't enjoy being assaulted by pig-men with bone clubs. Walking skeletons frighten them. Starvation is sad. Basically, they act a lot like real people, and its great!   The quirk system is similar. Your heroes acquire charactersitics as they plumb the depths, most of them weird. Your crusader may have been a holy hero once, but 10 weeks at the estate and he has become a nymphomaniac with syphillis and an obsession with corpses! Necrophilia, anyone? :P  Getting good at the game will likely take awhile. There are a lot of classes, and each one has numerous skills they can use in battle and while camping. Learning how to managae your money, provision your party for journies, and what buildings to upgrade first can also be confusing. It is all very do-able, it mostly just takes time because it is different. You will get used to it if you give it a chance.  Basically, DD takes a sort of George R.R. Martin view of adventuring. There are a lot of details that you do not encounter in, say, a Final Fantasy game. Heroes actually need food, for example. Torches don't last forever. Characters don't take crushing blows from a cleaver without reaction (sometimes they start screamng in unknown languages and then murder your hapless doctor...). It's a muddy, bloody good time. And larks for all ;)  Last Words: Experimental game-design done right, with some fantastic art direction and ideas, that results in a RPG masterpiece. Keep up the fantastic work Red Hook Games!!  Edit #1 (July 29, 2015) So, I wanted to revisit this review after spending some time with the new updates. The game is progressing nicely, with some new bosses and various quality of life fixes. Definitely a lot of hard work being put into the game, and it looks like it is shaping up to be one of the best RPGs around. The developers have been very responsive and have accomodated the forum requests and suggestions of fans like myself to a suprising degree. Still a highly recommended game!  Edit #2 (September 29, 2015) The Cove update was just released, and the game seems to just be getting better and better! If you have been keeping tabs on the game, you know that there was a wave of backlash over the last while concerning certain gameplay changes. I hopw that the discerning gamers out there will try to look past these and try the game anyway. Most of the criticism is unjustified and mainly related to the nerfing of certain strategies (cheese strategies that were near game-breaking, by the way). Perfectly justified choice on the part of the developer, in my opinion. I will retrun to the game sometime after full release day and give my final impressions.  Edit #3 (After Final Release) Well, the game is finally out. It's still good. It's not perfect and arguably did not live up to all of its promise, but is definitely worth the money. It is very hard, and can cause some frustration, so it is unsurprising that DD ended up being pretty divisive. If you enjoy rogue-likes, dungeon crawlers, or just plain hard games, then you've come to the right place! But seriously, there's this weird smear campaign going on, led by people who apparently 1) take this game way too seriously and 2) are prone to some very weird conspiracy theories about 'shills' and stuff. Ignore that. It's just a normal game.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®," The Short of It:    If you like permadeath, RPGs that have much tactical depth without a steep learning curve, and gorgeous, if slightly static, art, Darkest Dungeon will not disappoint you. It's punishing and difficult, but these nightmarish creatures  can  be felled, they  can  be beaten.    The Long of It:    Throughout Early Access, people's opinions on the game have shifted harder than a Cultist being bombarded by a Bounty Hunter's Flash Bang, which is the main reason you'll still see negative reviews, but the solution the developers finally settled on has been the absolute best one, and people not updating their reviews to reflect this is the main reason some reviews are still negative.  Darkest Dungeon is a dark dungeon crawler (heh), where you lead a party of four heroes and the items you provide for them into the depths, time and again, hoping every time they'll make it out alive, knowing the possibility is very real that they won't - and if they do, they might be so traumatized and mentally scarred that you decide to let them spend the rest of their lives wandering, impoverished and unhinged.   The entire game balances on the question, 'what are your heroes worth'? Given the constant influx of new hopefuls, it'll be very tempting to dismiss heroes or send them on a suicide mission to recover as much loot as possible, simply because you can't afford to take care of them. Because while wounds of the body heal, wounds of the mind do not, at least not without a sizeable cost in gold.  That is not to say all your heroes are doomed. They can win fights and clear dungeons, grow stronger and become Heroes worthy of a capital 'H', champions honed and trained for one purpose: to brave the depths of the eponymous Darkest Dungeon.  When your characters aren't delving in the depths of the Dankest Dungeon, you have 'free' time to upgrade the hamlet, adding some modest but interesting base building to the mix. With the heirlooms your heroes collect from the dungeons, you can upgrade buildings, whose functions range from upgrading weapons and armour to curing stress and disease or selling trinkets. Unless of course, the heirlooms remain forever in the dark, clutched in the dead hands of your adventurers.    The Right of It   You will get attached to your heroes, and the threat of them dying when they set out into the depths is always very real, but good preparation can minimize that risk. Darkest Dungeon uses a Random Number God who may throw a wrench in even the best-laid plans, but with the game's immensely clever and dynamic combat system, good planning and calculated responses to unexpected circumstances will do much to win the day.   So no, you have no direct control over the numbers, but yes, you can make a very significant difference as the player without success or failure hinging on die rolls. Character classes are so diverse (and individually customizable) that the possibilities of combining them are endless, and a good combination and positioning of characters is a fun challenge every time you assemble a team, as is a clear-headed response when enemies mess up your formation and heroes start having to fight in positions they're not accustomed to.  The base building aspect, while slightly grindy, is a streamlined but functional and efficient element, and seeing your hamlet get restored from a ruined ghost town to a thriving community is a joy to watch - even though the graveyards are packed with heroes who died to make it happen.   All this takes place in a world full of gothic, dark beauty, with an art style that never bores, even though the game consists mostly of still images, animated and moved to reflect what happens. This isn't to say that the game is a boring slideshow - the camera moves and pans, visual effects splatter off the screen, and thanks to good animation, the entire world is moving and alive.  Add a highly evocative narrator, Wayne June, who provides tons of atmosphere while hamming it up to just the right levels, and you've got a gripping experience that'll keep you engaged during every moment.    The Wrong of It   If you like high-poly 3D-models, motion capped animations and lighting that makes your 980TI Titan chug, then you'll probably want to pass on this. But it would be your loss, since the amazing art style and execution is more efficient and powerful than any amount of realism could ever be. The animators did a wonderful job too, making the still images come alive as the action unfolds.  Also, be aware that Darkest Dungeon is difficult. You'll need to stay focused if you wish to survive, because even trash mobs (and there aren't many of those) can devastate a party if the player's concentration lapses. Because of this, heroes will die. If you get attached to your heroes, like I do, this can be difficult to deal with. All players so far consider Darkest Dungeon's difficulty to be a plus, but if you want to just play a game and have fun without thinking too much, you might consider the difficulty a stumbling block.  Be aware that you can - and probably should - turn off many difficulty options introduced by the devs in Early Access to discourage certain tactics or make the game more hardcore, and that's a good thing. Some of those options were, with good reason, seriously disliked by most EA players, including myself, for making the game unfairly difficult.     The Last of It   Darkest Dungeon is a must have for any role player, save-scum hater, tactics fan, or really anyone who likes a solid challenge (s)he can overcome with clever and tactical thinking. In fact, I can recommend it to everyone except people who play video games purely as a relaxing distraction after a hard work day, because it does require concentration and active thinking.   Seriously, people, Red Hook created a masterpiece.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Excellent presentation and concept marred by a core gameplay loop based on grinding for gold and disposing of your characters. Progression is slow and unsatisfying, loot is rarely wanted. Treatment subsystems are essentially meaningless due to expense.  To get the things you need to upgrade the hamlet and the few good trinkets that exist, you need to go through higher level dungeons. To go through higher level dungeons, you need higher-level characters. To get higher level characters, you have to put them through the degredation of leveling up, which gives them all sorts of detriments that you can't get rid of because you don't have the money for treatment because you don't have the characters to beat the appropriate dungeons.   So you just hope for an Antiquarian and grind out apprentice dungeons.  Which is for the better, honestly: the apprentice dungeons are where the game is the most fun. Difficulty spikes on veteran dungeons are nothing short of grotesque and will appeal only to a certain subset of players.  It isn't anything like Dark Souls, and more's the pity.  e: Game is recommended with the Lighter Dungeon mod, which alleviates much of the grind and makes it easier to take care of your crew.",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Dang-♥♥♥ Dungeon is a gritty dungeon crawler thats appealed to a person that usually doesn't like turn based games. The artwork is talented and disturbing, the music fits the atmosphere (I love how daunting and 'uphill battle' the combat music sounds) and the game design is clever in its own unique ways.  As a game dev myself I especially enjoyed the clever game design to keep the player challenged. The game clearly has an agenda to break any sort of easy routine and strategy in managing your roster and money, and makes sure the player knows this through mechanics. For example, in the game you are forced to send a party out each week to advance time. However to prevent the player from endlessly farming easy quests with the same heroes, to prevent them from advancing a week with no effort, your heroes will eventually grow bored of the apprentice quests and refuse to take part, so you will have to spend resources to send out rookies which won't be able to easily roll those quests as much as your vets.  While the game has a lot going for it for game design, there are still a few flaws. It feels like the game's difficulty agenda gets ahead of itself, and bad stuff can happen to you for seemingly no reason just to throw you for a loop. This would be fine if the game would outright state its trying to ♥♥♥♥ you, but instead it does it in ways that seem to resist its own rules. For example, for no reason at all, even without being Marked, the 4-creature party will continually focus one of your squishier heroes into the ground. You can try using a Man-At-Arms or Crusader to mark themselves, but when this is happening it usually doesn't help and they'll continue to slaughter the one character. You have all of these abilities but occasionally the game refuses to listen and will throw any advantages you have from those abilities out the window.   Despite the negative reviews, a frustrating set back once in a while should not really overshadow the game's polish, well thought out game play and clear love the developers have for it. A game is not bad because you can't beat it.  I haven't been too far along yet but I'll definitely play more, however I've seen some complaints about the end-game and it sounds incredibly unpleasant, so unless something REALLY clicks I only really see myself playing this until I succeed in my first assault.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I'm not gonna deny, I am a massive fan of this game. Come to think of it, it would certainly be in my top 15 games of all time. But, before I sing this game any praises, I want to share my thoughts on some criticisms people bring up when talking about Darkest Dungeon and how I feel about gameplay in general. This is going to be a long one, but I just feel the need to talk about this in detail.  Many people like to compare Darkest Dungeon to  Dark Souls . And I think it is fair to a degree - both games have dark, brooding aesthetics and pose a significant challenge to the player, while having a steep learning curve. But I don't think the core principles of these games are alike. In Dark Souls, the player is in control all the time, the game will not offer you help, nor will it deliberately undermine your progress and make your life harder. There are no unknown variables either, as soon as you are comfortable with your character and know all the patterns, that's it, you will never lose if your mechanical execution is perfect.   It is not the case with Darkest Dungeon however. There is only so much you can do to succeed, but it is not entirely up to you. This is why a major component of the game is  risk management . Since you can't outskill your enemies with perfect tactics when your party is at the brink of death, sometimes you just have to cut your losses and escape. This is a big part of getting good at Darkest Dungeon, learning when you should and, more importantly, shouldn't press on. To be fair, if you get good at this game, you will succeed at the overwhelming majority of your quests, but sometimes the game will destroy you. This is why I think an apt comparison would be  online poker  (an important distinction, because in ordinary poker there is a whole another level of mind games). You have to play smart and hedge your bets, if the odds are not in your favour, it isn't worth committing in many cases. Of course, there are times, when you have  full house , but the game has  straight flush . The thing about Darkest Dungeon however, it lets you stack the 'deck' in your favor by effectively utilizing party combinations, properly equipping your characters, and using tactics to your advantage.   Why am I telling you this and why is it important? I feel like a lot of people go into game with false expectations, feeling that it's gonna be a Dark Souls experience to the letter and end up being disappointed or thinking they were misled. Which is often followed by criticizing the game for  not being what it never supposed to be . The game does well what it was created to do and it never pretended it is something more than it is. So before you post an angry review, blaming 'stupid RNG', remember that it was a part of the deal and you agreed to it. I think RNG is pretty well-tuned actually, fringe cases don't happen that often. Does RNG makes the game worse than similar games that don't rely on it? I don't think so, and the good thing is there is plenty of room for all kinds of games, with RNG or without it.   Now, let's talk about the game being grindy. By nature, many games are grindy in one way or another, because all of them have some sort of  gameplay loop . If you don't enjoy the loop itself or have no incentive to continue, you will be bored, and it is, of course, very subjective. I'm gonna be honest here, via gameplay means the game doesn't do a very good job of motivating you to keep playing. It doesn't make you feel empowered as you progress, nor does it let you essentially overpower the game by putting in time, like some RPG games that let you get the best equipment and faceroll through hordes of previously challenging enemies. What did it for me is that I actually enjoy said gameplay loop and the fact that the world of the game and the story intrigue me greatly, so I was very excited to uncover bits and pieces about it as I go.   With gameplay out of the way, it's time to talk about other things the game has to offer, and boy, it has to offer a lot. It is hard to me to separate from each other elements like music, visuals, sound design and story, because they work together so well. Yeah, let's call it  presentation  and it is mindblowingly good. If I had to name a game I played that nail its aesthetic and presentation the most, I'd name Darkest Dungeon in a heartbeat. The art in this game is great and consistently dark and depressing, enemy design is terrifying and intimidating, accompanied by wonderful sound design and music that gets progressively more intense as your torch runs out of steam. The story is intriguing and for the most part told by the narrator, voiced by one and only  Wayne June . It is so ridiculously well-written and voiced that I'd dare to say that it is even better than narrators from games like  Bastion  and  The Stanley Parable  and believe me, it hurts to admit it, because I absolutely love Bastion and Rucks, but the Ancestor is just too good. Did I already tell you how well-written it is? Even if I did, it is worth mentioning twice. I don't know how they haven't tun out of pompous words to use, the writing is chock full of them. I wouldn't be surprised if a typical dinner at Red Hook consists of  Oxford Paperback Thesaurus , a couple of entries form  H. P. Lovecraft: The Complete Collection  and for the dessert, a vintage  Webster's Third New International Dictionary '61  (that was a good year).   In conclusion, I absolutely recommend you to buy the game, unless you don't like challenging games, hate any degree of RNG in games or don't like playing games, unless they constantly motivate you to keep playing. Maybe this review is too long and nobody will read it or it will be downvoted into oblivion just because, I am happy I said whet I wanted to say.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"I had a lot of fun in the beginning, but at the moment it is far too unbalanced.

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Divine, addicting beyond human ken, nothing beats the sheer pleasure of feeding your life to the screen at 2AM with less than five hours of sleep 'till normality, just to beat the Wizened Hag and screaming in terror as your Hellion is dipped yet again into the cauldron.  Part management game, part deep tactical RPG, part drug. Easy 2016 GOTY contender for me.",1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Great concept with a few serious short comings. The initial apprentice dungeons and intermediate veteran dungeons are difficult, yet well balanced and rewarding. This isn't the case for the champion dungeons. I understand the game is based on the concept of 'making the best out of a bad situation', but the late game difficulty spike is ridiculous. Basic enemies encountered in champion dungeons are seemingly on par with previous boss fights. My best heroes (max level, equipment, and skills) we're more often than not getting hopelessly roflstomped 2-3 battles in...even on short scouting quests. To make matters worse, management mechanics become increasingly skewed. For example, the weird level cap system prevents heroes from partaking in quests below their corresponding level, making it unnecessarily difficult to train badly-needed replacements and raise funds. Overall, late game play feels less about exploring dungeons/smighting evil and more about bolstering lost gold and manpower (tedious/unrewarding grinding). After a couple hours of frustration, I threw in the towel. I doubt I have the motivation to finish it in its current state. Total shame, I really enjoyed it up to this point.  I realize Red Hook has plans to implement a short mode. Hopefully they address some of these issues/give the game more mass-appeal. Until then, I can't recommend this to anyone but hardcore RPG fans.....casual gamers stay away!",-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"Was one of my favorite games when it first came out as Early Access.  Was widely considered Earyl Access done right, unfortunately thats not the case anymore. The developers added too many features that made the game very 'grindy' in the name of their 'vision'.   I know this is what they intended to do but the game is no longer fun. It used to be enjoyable to get frustrated at taking a risk and getting brutally punished for it. Now its just play it safe and pray to RNGesus. I've gotten increadible stupid luck when it comes to some battles where I was stuck in loops of high crit attacks (5 enemy crits in a row on the same character) and healing them every round so I wont loose them.  It used to be stressful in a smart way. Now its just infuriating and annoying.",-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,"While any good roguelike serves to punish you for make mistakes, Darkest Dungeon takes this a step further. The game is designed to punish you regardless as to your choices--not just by making the game more difficult, but my making the game pointlessly long. The game forces you to continually grind lower level quests while your highest level heros have to relieve stress (possibly for multiple weeks). Late game forces you to only use your heros once for the final quests, meaning if you have a great team comp and you complete one of the final quests, you have to start from square one if you want that team comp again. Certain quests sack your village causing you to have to restore it--yes you can stop this, but after beating it the first time it offers you no reward for doing so, making the game even longer.  I would say that 3/4ths of my play time was spent mindlessly grinding just so that I could get on with the story, only to fail because of a bad miss and have to start again. The core concept and gameplay is interesting, albeit repetitive, but it is unneedingly punishing in ways that don't make the game interesting. Punishment should come due to making bad decisions, but in The Darkest Dungeon, punishment comes because they want to keep you playing longer. And that just isn't fun.",-1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.   I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on 'high', except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.  You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.  If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.  Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.  GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.  I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.  I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit 'Z' to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.  GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.  Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"First of all...  ROCKSTAR IS NOT BANNING FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODS.  They've now stated this outright.

Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.  Like seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.  In any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?  9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.  P.S. Stop being idiots.  Edit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:  http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire    “I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?” - @ClarkMatthew63 “Will I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?” - @Mattophobia   We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional,  no one has been banned for using single player modifications , and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.  But by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said 'they didn't do it'. It's not like cheaters to lie about it or anything.",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V," GTA 5 finally arrives on PC after a long delay but the big question is, was it worth the wait?    If you haven't played GTA on previous and current gen consoles then this you will definitely want to get it. The campaign on its own is totally worth the price and with all the Stranger missions, you will be occupied for some time. However, the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more. Rockstar's main focus post-release is on GTA: Online and with their regular release of free updates, there's always something new for players to try out. For any beginners to GTA: Online, here's a handy and short guide with all the need to know         YouTube™ Video:  GTA PC Online: A Beginners Guide to Online&nbsp;",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015. The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards.   GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story. The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics. I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between. The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored.   The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two. My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game.   As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other. The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing.   The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on. Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map.   The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty.   Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.  The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose.   Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here. The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game. The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly.   I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore; it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V," Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.   A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:     Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)  Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)  Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion  Fastest video game to gross $1 billion  Highest-grossing video game in 24 hours  Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)  Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game  Most viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)    Graphics  1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.  2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me.   a)  Day/Night cycle recreation.  Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.  b)  Rain.  Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one  BUT  the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well,  THE SOUND . This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).  c)  Night time, baby!  Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.  3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.  Gameplay and Features  Oh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.  1.  Car Control  I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.  2.  Randomness.  Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get ♥♥♥♥♥, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.  3.  Los Santos Customs.  Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism  AFTER  the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game.   4.  Activities.  Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode.    There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&amp;HF  ",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"This is the home GTA V always deserved, but never got, until now.  Welcome home. We've all been waiting for you.   EDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.  Performance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.  The game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.  In my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV.  Driving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.  In addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add.   As for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:          YouTube™ Video:  WILL DO&nbsp;",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Game of the year simulator.  If you're thinking about buying a game and you don't have GTA5 you basically need this game.   BEWARE you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but I can play it on a Radeon HD 5870 1GB without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. No complaints in the optimization department.   EDIT: I got a Radeon R9 290 4GB video card not long after getting the game and it is a WORLD of difference if you are able to run it at higher settings. When you have the minimum settings (what you would need to select if running on a 5870) compared against high settings on the 290, it's like playing a different game entirely. This game is beautiful. On the graphics menu I can set every option to the maximum setting and I leave anti-aliasing at 2x, then on the advanced graphics menu I leave everything at the lowest possible setting. I hear people with SLI Titans can barely max outo the advanced menu and I watched a guy on youtube with 4x R9 290s and he didn't even use as high of a setting selection as I did with just one. It depends on what framerate you want, 120, 60, or 30 FPS is possible depending if you have the hardware to back it up. Maybe one day a video card will exist which is affordable and can truly max the game out, but trust me this game is able to really well optimized. I had originally a quad core Phenom II X4 965 processor in my computer and it ran all cores at exactly 100% solid the whole time I played. On any settings. I didn't feel like buying a new motherboard just yet so I went on eBay and got a 6-core Phenom II X6 1055T to swap in there, and instantly my whole game became way smoother. It sits at 70-80% usage across all 6 cores the whole time I am playing if not more. This 5-6 year old platform can run pretty much any newer game out there but nothing has been able to tap it and use all of it's resources so efficiently than GTA5.   I must say, the PC options are fantastic. There is a LOT of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. My favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part I can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. It just works. It's perfect.  The gameplay itself needs no introduction. You can do pretty much anything. Even online play is pretty good, first time I played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died.  10/10",1,1

More seriously though: I've played every GTA since 3, and they've all been fun but only for a short amount of time. I only did missions for the sake of progress and to get new stuff. I never cared really. Not the case with 5 at all. I haven't come across a single thing that I can point at and say 'that's not good'.

I did not skip a single cutscene.   The Online portion of this game feels like an MMORPG, you level up, gain money and buy transport, weapons, clothes and your very own apartment. Rockstar is constantly developing content for Online and so far the best update for GTAO that has ever come out is the Online Heists. Well, Online freemode with randoms feels like World War 3 so I suggest you play on Invite Only lobbies until you get a decent level.  &nbsp;Modding is supported by Rockstar which is great but keep it outside of Online, you don't want to get banned. .dll injectors and such stay away from them since they're classified as cheats.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Great game. Horrible online 'community'.  If you find yourself shooting players who can't be killed, being constantly warped to the top of the FIB building, or being killed while in passive mode, you're probably having your gaming experience ruined by one or more Russians. Here’s how to identify/avoid them:  1. Don't play between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. EST. That’s 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. in Putingrad and the time you’re more likely to catch them between blackout hangovers.  2. If you see a guy trying to give his T20 a carrot 'to make go', he's red. He's probably more Borat than Ivan Drago, but eh... All the same, really. Do I look like an anthropologist or a zookeeper?  3. Insurance fraud and frivolous lawsuits count for ~ 97% of local GDP in the motherland. If a player dives in front of your speeding car for no reason, he’s likely a Russian. Invest in a dashboard cam if you play in the morning.  Remember, you have a jobs, electricity, food, and Charmin -- and all in ample supply. You're better than they are. They know it.",1,1

He spawned a boat &amp; a sea plane and we went to his yacht. We were joined by more people and we all hung out in the hot tub.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Let’s cut to the chase: GTA V is one of the best games ever, go get it immediately! Now if you want to know more, let’s expand it a bit then. The game is fun and really solid in every way, the controls and playability are well implemented and responsive. On the technical side, it has some really stunning and beautiful graphics and effects, the city looks gorgeous and the countryside, desert zones, woods, beaches, mountains, etc., are just amazing. The sea is what impressed me the most, IMO it’s over the top, it feels very realistic and when you stand near the shore you feel video games will never be the same again if a virtual sea can be this overwhelming. It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits, so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra-settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it. I’m very happy with this version, yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless.  As a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do, it feels huge! Coop is really fun and amazing, with lots of unlockable missions, races, heists, sports, shopping, activities, and a lot more to do, plus they keep adding more and more content. The story mode is well developed and it has funny characters (in their own GTA way). The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be in a -rated M- GTA). At first I thought the idea of having 3 characters simultaneously was strange and probably not good, but when you play it you realize it works really well. Gameplay wise, driving is well implemented, intuitive and feels natural, shooting, swimming, running and moving around are too. The game is cool as it is on 3d person already, but it adds the bonus of a 1st person experience, you can switch on the go and it’s really nice too. And with so many types of vehicles, ground, air and sea, and a lot of guns at your disposal, it never feels repetitive or boring. I love clothing and shopping, I have spent hours in the clothing stores, shopping is fun! On the sound department the effects are stunning and I love the soundtrack!, a lot of GTA V songs now are part of my personal playlists.  In general a lot of attention was given to every little detail. This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game, simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth. I absolutely love it. So once again, if you don’t have it yet, what are you waiting for?, you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this. See ya in Los Santos!   Vayamos al grano: GTA V es uno de los mejores juegos de siempre, ve y consíguelo de inmediato!. Ahora si quieres saber más, entonces vamos a expandirlo un poco más. El juego es divertido, realmente solido en todos los sentidos, los controles y jugabilidad están bien implementados y son responsivos. En el lado técnico, tiene unas gráficas y efectos realmente asombrosos y hermosos, la ciudad luce preciosa, la campiña, las zonas desérticas, los bosques, las playas, las montañas, etc., son todos increíbles. El océano es lo que más me impresionó, en mi opinión es lo más sobresaliente, se siente muy realista y cuando te paras cerca de la orilla sientes que los videojuegos nunca más volverán a ser iguales si un mar virtual puede ser tan sobrecogedor. Realmente se siente como este juego está llevando los videojuegos de PC a sus límites, así que si tienes un equipo sólido para correrlo, entonces descubrirás aquí uno de los más vistosos juegos y también uno de los más impresionantes a nivel técnico para PC jamás logrado. El tener una PC capaz de correr esta bestia en ultra te hará sentir que todo tu equipo está siendo puesto a prueba y que tu inversión ha valido la pena. Estoy muy feliz con esta versión, la versión de PC es increíble y casi todo es impecable. Como buen sandbox este mundo abierto tiene literalmente montones de cosas que hacer, ¡se siente enorme!. El cooperativo es realmente divertido e increíble, con muchas misiones desbloqueables, carreras, golpes, deportes, compras, actividades y más por hacer, además le agregan a menudo más y más contenido.  El modo de historia está bien desarrollado y posee personajes divertidos (muy a la manera de GTA). El humor es satírico y políticamente incorrecto (como debe ser en un - Clasificación M – GTA). Al principio pensé que la idea de tener 3 personajes simultáneos era extraña y probablemente no muy buena, pero cuando juegas te das cuenta de que funciona muy bien. A nivel de jugabilidad , la conducción está bien implementada, es intuitiva y se siente natural, disparar, nadar, correr y moverte por todos lados lo son también. El juego es genial así, pero agrega el bono de una experiencia en primera persona, puedes cambiar en cualquier momento y también es genial. A esto agrégale que con tantos vehículos de tierra, aire y agua y con montones de armas a tu disposición, nunca lo sentirás repetitivo o aburrido. A mí me encanta la ropa e ir de compras, he pasado horas en las tiendas de ropa, ¡ir de compras es divertido! En el departamento de sonido los efectos son maravillosos y ¡me encanta el soundtrack!, muchas de las canciones de GTA V ahora forman parte de mis listas de reproducción personales. En general le pusieron bastante atención a cada pequeño detalle. Esto es básicamente una obra maestra y un juego perfecto, simplemente uno de los mejores juegos que hay para PC. Se le hizo justicia a los gamers de PC y la espera valió la pena. Yo lo adoro, este debe ser la edición definitiva de GTA V. Así que una vez más, si aún no lo tienes, ¿que estas esperando?, deberías estar jugándolo justo ahora en lugar de estar aquí leyendo esto. ¡Nos vemos en Los Santos!",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Stripclubs and weed at 60+ fps...... 10/10   To be serious though, this is the best version of GTA 5 no doubt about it. The new aditions are wonderful and playing at an uncapped fps is a joy. As for GTA 5 itself, this is now the 3rd copy I have gotten and it is a game I still enjoy playing. Much more fun than GTA 4 was, this is pretty much San Andreas 2!   Nice graphics, runs well, fun gameplay and a bunch of new additions make GTA 5 on PC a must own weither you havn't play GTA in the past or not, get your hands on this if you are looking for an open world sandbox gta game. One more thing, the online works ALOT better than it did on the console versions.   Now all we need is Red Dead Redemption to come to PC! Rockstar has done a very good job on ths PC version of this and I continue to hope we get RDR on PC before RDR2 drops.  The singleplayer has always been what I enjoyed for GTA5, the online didn't grab me much in the past but with Heists now it is improved and worth checking out. Interested to try more in the editor and hopefully see some interesting mods in the future.",1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Had this since launch on PS3, have since owned it on PS4 and now PC. Only game I've ever owned on three platforms. Managed to transfer all my progress (houses, cash etc) from PS3 character. Game looks fantastic on PC, no wonder it took so long. This isn't your average PC port. Performance is generally around 60fps on high/ultra mix with a GTX980Ti and i7 config.  To the game. Personally I'd say the campaign is worth the price alone. You control three characters, with varying degrees of likeability. Story is lengthy and fun. Lots of side missions. Great humour throughout. Solid script. Bank heists are great. Everything you expect from a classic GTA game. To the multiplayer, where a total gem can be found. A true open-world title. You can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer. Feel free to just explore, or undertake in the endless number of missions available. You can even play user created games, or create your own! Online heists were added, and although only 5 of them, they are a huge amount of fun playing. (Especially with friends) each heist requires several setup missions - all varied in nature. Heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for GTAOnline.  Why would you need currency online? Because there is literally a mountain of things to buy. 100's of cars, planes, helicopters, yachts, weapons properties. You need a lot of cash if you want to live the Los Santos high-life. Participating in jobs online also pays (though not much) this could be races, team deathmatches, stunt rides or contact missions. PvP is also pretty well done, with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks, jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry. Tip, if you're low ranked, think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players. If you're fed up of players C4'ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode, which means you can no longer be shot (or shoot) There doesn't appear to be any online level cap, so you can keep advancing. Though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 (minigun)  My only two negatives would be - - Modders. Modding splits a community in two. Some people love it, some hate it. GTAOnline is ravaged by modders. My opinion is that modding is fine, if on the single player, or doing random jokey things online. It can lead to hilarious moments (shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head) but equally ruins the game. Here's why - some may have no intention of harming other players, and instead throw endless money on people (probably as two-fingered salute to R*'s extortionate cash-cards you can purchase with real £'s (£60 for $8m credits)) Great! You say. Not really. It's fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort, but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones, noone does missions, because it's easier to beg a modder for cash. (You see this in EVERY lobby) Taking cash from modders can also get you banned from GTAOnline. So, even the good modding is bad online. Why grind a 30 minute mission for &lt;$50k, when a modder drops $2m in 5 minutes... Sadly, this is now the mindset of most players. Now to the bad modders. Modders who use mods for PvP purposes. This could be all your usual expected PC game hacks. Aimbots, boosted health, invincibility, teleportation etc. But it can also be so much more. Modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button. They can set it so players spawn, and instantly explode - leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down GTA in task manager. They can change the rain to jumbo jets, crashing PC's as they cannot cope with the strain 100's of jumbos falling causes. Griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage. They can drop UFO's on you when you're trying to fight, fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars. It's literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server - best option is to change servers, but most the same currently. - Second negative is just a general lack of cool details in Los Santos. In San Andreas, if you saw a pinball machine, or a pool table, chances are you could use it. In GTAV this isn't the case. Not a massive issue, just an observation.  There is so much more I could say about the game. Overall the amount of free DLC added since launch, plus endless XP events and sales held weekly for in-game items, new game-modes. This is by far the best value for money game I've ever bought. £35 is almost incredible, given the trend of charging for DLC etc. Rockstar have given it all for free.",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Grand Theft Auto V, does it really need an introduction? In GTA V you explore a huge open world as three very different criminals. What you do is up to you as Los Santos and Blaine County offer a wide variety of activities, legal and not so legal, on the side of main missions, heists and side missions. Los Santos and Blaine County are not only explored through our three story protagonists, you can also take to the streets, sea and sky with a custom created character usable in both the Online game modes and the Director mode.  Speaking of game modes, GTA V has three main modes. First off, we have the afore mentioned story mode featuring our three lovable criminals, there's not much to say about this one apart from what's already been said. Secondly, we have GTA Online where you can complete jobs and participate in other activities with friends and others using a character you create. Lastly, we have the Director Mode which allows you to play as any of the characters found in Los Santos and Blaine County as well as giving you access to a number of cheats, this game mode is designed to be used with the Rockstar Editor to create short films/videos.  Before I continue with my review I just want to point out I also have around 150 hours of game time on Xbox 360 on top of my PC game time.  +Fantastic graphics, even if you aren't running the game on ultra this game looks fantastic +Excellent gameplay, from driving to flying to the game's gunplay, everything feels satisfying and reasonably realistic (by this I do not mean it feels like it would in the real world, rather it simply does not feel fake) +A good, engaging story with excellently made characters +As mentioned earlier the game world is huge +Fantastic voice acting, particularly the three protagonists +A rather large array of weapons to choose from, each with a number of purchasable attachments and cosmetic changes +A variety of settings to be seen throughout the game world +Numerous different radio stations available while driving each with a fair few songs as well as the ability to create your own radio station with your own songs +A huge number of vehicles ranging from mopeds to jet airliners, most land vehicles have a number of upgrades and paintjobs available +A number of different camera angles in vehicles and on foot including a first person camera which is an awesome edition to the game +Several activities to take part in outside of missions such as racing, tennis, golf and more +Lots of clothes, tattoos and several hairstyles available for the protagonists and your online character +Already a number of mods available (I'll return to mods later) +Rockstar have released quite a bit of free content since the release of GTA V +GTA V comes with an intergrated video recorder and editor which allows you to create short films/videos with relative ease. The Rockstar editor can also be used to create beautiful screenshots of the game using frames from a recorded video and then adding filters to them +A lot of GTA Online missions +Controls are great (played with a Gamepad)  -The Online character creator isn't particularly good and doesn't give you much control over your character's features -Open lobbies in Online are absolutely filled with hackers and if the hackers effect your character in anyway you run the risk of being banned by Rockstar -If you leave your mods enabled when you enter GTA Online you run the risk of being banned, this means you have to go to the effort of disabling mods everytime you wish to switch between SP and MP -Rockstar used some questionable business practices during the Steam Summer Sale, it didn't effect me as I already owned the game but I feel it was worth mentioning  -GTA Online uses Rockstar's Social Club DRM rather than Steamworks which is not only frustrating because it means going through another DRM, it also means Online relies on Rockstar's servers which have had a number of issues -Loading times are awful, I've only seen one game that has longer loading times than GTA V -Getting RP (basically XP) and Money in Online requires a ridiculous amount of grinding and in Online money really does buy happiness which makes this irritating  Verdict: An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)  GTA V, particularly Online, does have its issues but when it comes to Open World freedom and enjoyment nothing comes close. With fantastic graphics, excellent gameplay, lots of weapons, lots of vehicles and a huge world this really is not a game you should pass up on.   No drama,  Just Reviews    El K.",1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Hello community, I have decided to write a review about GTA V!   First of all I love the game series sooo much and I have played them all since GTA 1. So I hope that my review will be quite objectively. Please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me. After playing GTA V more than 300 hours I think now it´s time to discuss buisness!  PROS:  -The singleplayer in this game is awesom .... there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more. -The storry from singleplayer is great, good redline through the game with lot´s of fun missions and great heists. -Graphics on high end PC are quite nice, could have been better :D -Fantastic ambience throughout the whole world ! AMAZING ! -Masterpiece of soundtrack! The radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music! -Great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect. -TV and Internet ... all thumbs up :D  CONS: -The multiplayer!!! (I have waited sooo long to play a GTA game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people! but it is impossible) -Permanent laggy gamesessions. -Connection errors all the time. -Friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently! -Hours of loading screens!!!! (I´m running this game on high end PC with SSD drive and still loading for hours) -very low payout rate of money! (a friend played GTA V on PS3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days ... so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists! it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever) which takes me to my next point ... -HACKERS!!! The damn game is full with hackers .... everywhere!!! Rockstar doesn´t seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time!!!! jumped through 5 puplic lobbies, encountered 7 hackers. breaking the whole realm, shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons, teleporting with godmode, screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker! I`M SICK OF THEM ....I ALSO AM SICK OF ♥♥♥♥♥ PLAYERS JOINING THE LOBBIES ... FIRST QUESTION ASKED: Is there a hacker here, I need money!!! WTF ... such a-holes should be banned too, right from the moment they typed in this question! Don´t missunderstand me here, I HAVE A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HACKERS! They ruin everybodys game expierience!!! And people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion!  Last words:  I really love the game and I will continue to play it, but i´m not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance! I will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design! The multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me :D ROCKSTAR PLEASE SOLVE THE HACKER PROBLEM!!!  I would totally recommend GTA V to everybody. BUT, be aware of the multiplayer! Maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price! You will totally not regret buying it then!  Best regards Boudewijn IJzenarm",1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"While the PC version of this outstanding game is new, it's been out long enough on consoles that I don't need to go into every single thing about the game so I'll just sum up what I personally like, (ALOT) and don't like (Not too much).

The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same.  When the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes.  It truly feels like a living world.  -The Satire What I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto.  The signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations.  -The Characters There are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey.   None of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them. The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life.   -The First Person Mode Not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes.  -The Radio Stations There's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking 'We Built This City' by Starship or 'Heartbeat' by Don Johnson. If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like.   Dislikes:  -The Police They seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me.  -The Storefronts I just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games.  -The Sub and the Helicopter For me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this.  -Real Time Destruction Again, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments.  -Extra Activities Given the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth.  That's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked.  Those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time.

Rockstar definitely proved me wrong, after the amount of rage I went through on GTA IV and how much of a crappy PC port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors, all of that seems to be fixed in GTA V PC with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"To those thinking about this game post- FREE WEEKEND around September 5th, 2015 and forward, this is for you.  TL; DR: DON'T GET EVOLVE (for reasons listed below from an active community member to one that has had his heart crushed with how this game came to be)  Four areas covered in review: 1. Context and Game Development 2. Product/DLC Release Cycle 3. Gameplay and Mechanics 4. The Community and Match Making 5. Summary 6. My Playhours justified!  Context and Game Development:   For those that continued reading, I'll start off with some context since the game's launch, in case many newcomers do not know or care to do the research. The game was released earlier this year, post a very productive alpha and beta. However, shortly thereafter, you may have heard of the DLC uproars and consistent bugs/glitches/fails that plagued the retail version for a very long time prior to any patches. Due to development focusing on the production cycle, the fixes were set in parallel to what developer provided the console version. Therefore, realize this that some bugs still exist (talking about the stupid cursor bug that happens once in awhile, and a few others) due to a delayed patch cycle. Even with patches, many things seem to be a '1 step forward, 3 step backwards' type of deal. That is, due to the rapid push-out of DLC, the game has continued to experience new problems most patches, or just pure errors that again take time to fix.   Product/DLC release cycle:   I'll be short and sweet with this. The DLC release for the game, many find exploitive and attrocious. As for my opinion, I am fine with the DLC, but as of late, it has become a disappointment. In the beginning, the DLC was standalone; most of the DLC was cosmetic as skins for weapons, character or class specific and what not. The skins themselves were weapons only, meaning the overall design of the characters would not be altered in any form besides weapons or color schemes, but this has changed with the release of the Meteor Goliath.   Upon release of new characters, monsters were sold individually and so were hunters (this individual sale was where the problem resided). After a community uproar, the sale policy was changed and those tier 4 characters were provided via Season Pass 1. Same to the tier 5 characters with the introduction of the Season Pass 2, yet it did take time to change to this bulk buy concept. To TRS' (Turtle Rock Studios) defense, this was their first AAA title and IP, so it was still a learning experience, but the overall monetization efforts between them as well as the publisher My2k was a big failure.   Gameplay and Mechanics:  Yet, the most upsetting part was despite the awesome content, the combination of new content and a fledging company resulted in terrible balance issues between hunters and monsters, even character specific. These problems still persist and despite the outcry, these problems will continue. The issue resides in the process of balancing where character trials are done by Pros and ESL Teams (keyword being TEAMS), meaning minor balance adjustments pros suggest catastrophically impact the overall public player base due the unreliability of solo matchmaking and metagame mechanics of tracking/hunting/team-composition.   To put it in lamens terms, the pro teams that provide feedback for character debuffs/nerfs or buffs run in teams far more efficient than anything you will encounter in public matchmaking. Therefore, if someone picks something out of the recommended team composition or perks, the entire team suffers as random teams cannot perform to the level of pros or regular teams which consist of friends willing to communicate. Some ways this misrepresentation has ruined gameplay/mechanics stems into monster health/survivability and just simple things like how ineffective the hunter jetpack has become as of late. This misrepresentation results in the whole community debates of 'Monsters too OP, or Hunters too OP.' This disproportionate representation inevitably leads to similar issues of player base segmentation due to skill gaps as described in the following category.  Community and Matchmaking:  Finally, the last category many will be most interested in as this is still an area of concern and all else aside, my main reason to recommend not buying the game. The community has risen and fallen multiple times since the game's release (which has been about half a year almost at the time of review). At the moment, the community has fallen under the 300 Steam mark, meaning you cannot view players online in game anymore since the number is so low. This inevitably leads to horrible teamplay as skill levels differ so much. Even more so, the new Matchmaking 2.0 makes the traditional Hunt mode to be a catastrophic failure as the skill segmentation is done poorly due to the inbalance between players. You may have experienced some form or another of said reasons in the free-to-play weekend, but these problems will persist post-weekend as the player base again levels out.   More so, the overall community is inaccurately respresented in many forms. The subreddit for evolve may have more members posting than those playing at a time, along with the game developers continuing to favor the input of pros to continue this infant dream of competitive gameplay. I say infant due to the overarching problem of a small player base negatively impacting any efforts to improve competitive matchmaking.  If unknown, Matchmaking 2.0 is an effort by TRS to promote competitive ranked play. Prior to MM 2.0, players could play the traditional Hunt mode without any penalty of leaving prior to match completion without penalties in the form of reduced Character rank or timeouts. MM 2.0 has shifted the traditional form into only ranked play, meaning the original Hunt mode was removed for this competive copy and there is no way to enjoy the original Hunt form outside of running a Evacuation gameplay (Evac being the 5 day campaign, either PVP or PVE, being 4v1 or 4vCP) or custom match with friends.  Summary:  To sum up my overall decision, with the reasons above and with foreshadowing as the game development is plateauing out due to the final push for DLC coming out soon in the form of the remaining Tier 5 characters, it is a good idea to avoid the game, at least until it is within the $20 - $30 mark. However, by that time, I assume the game's player base would have fallen even further, so its best to avoid purchasing the game.   Thanks for reading!    Edit Sept. 5, 2015:  My Playhours Justified:  Had this as a comment to address my play hours, but people skipped it, so here's my justification for play hours.  To those mentioning my play hours, realize my review is based off of the time since the beginning to now, post all that development. To be frank, as many others have mentioned it in other reviews, the game was extremely promising in the beginning being visually and mechanically fresh, so let's say ~250 of those hours were within the first 3 months of game release. By that time, many DLC and patches came out coupled with balancing issues where my play time dropped drastically as the appeal to the game fell.   Since then, the only real reason I do play, or continue to do so is due to my own friends playing it far more intensively than I am. I became a part of a team, and was the dedicated medic for most matches, so I can't necessarily leave friends hanging, as playing without a dedicated team is tough. However, recent changes are making that seem like a viable solution rather than continuing as my recent 'hours played in the last 2 weeks show.' I only say this as many can understand, playing a game to only experience frustration or ending on a sour mood post play is not appealing in any way.  Thanks again for reading!",-1,1

Time that maybe I should've dedicated to my wife. I mean... I don't have any. But... that's kinda my point.  600+ hours. What we had wasn't casual. My friends kept asking me how could I go on with this. What they couldn't understand is that, although it was always hard to make things work between us, when they worked, it was something very special.  I'm not rich, but still I bought new dresses for your monsters, new make-up for your weapons, took everything to Elite status... Including Kala... Oh, yes... including Kala.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Great Game, Solid all round in gameplay, competitive and a lot of replayability with different strats/compesitions.

If you are against big name companies like 2k doing this then do not buy this game.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Let me be perfectly honest, I absolutely had a blast playing this game in Alpha and Beta. However due to the sort of marketing. pre-order bonuses, and DLC insanity I cannot recommend this game.  Pros:  Varied hunter and monster tactics make for interesting matches. Intense match progression as hunters and monster Playing the monster and getting to level 3 without taking a scratch is the funnest thing ever. High level skill cap that rewards a smart playstyle Level based matchmaking  Cons: Insane exponential progression that seems like they're padding out the game life.  I've been quickmatched into a full game just to spectate (Yeah it was probably a bug)  No party options for 5 players.  Considering that Turtle Rock has announced plans for additional DLC as the game develops, why is it that I can pay 85.88 today for all of the DLC? This is a full price game with a F2P model for DLC.  Absolute rage inducing collision (Clarification: I was trapped by a dome and thouight I could escape through a narrow pass but my monster was just stuck running while I got shredded by hunters)  TL;DR It's a DLC Fest  PS: for clarification I played the beta to the most completion I could: 8 hunters and 2 monsters were leveled to skilled (star 1).",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I would discourage againt buying this game. The game is shifted to a point where new players must play with other bad players to receive a rank. Thereafter you will most likely be stuck with terrible players as top players have already formed parties and do not want to lose their rank by losing games with newer players.   Furthermore DLC is continously being released which you have to pay for. The downloadable characters are overpowered in order to temp you to buy them but in fact it just ruins the game as it is no longer balanced.   Lastly, and perhaps most imperative is the fact that minimal game support is provided to gamers outside their main target markets. Thus gamers such as myself are forced to play with terrible connections. This makes the game almost unplayable if you are paired with someone from a far location- which is likely the case since their player base has declined so dramatically. The game experience for all concerned is utterly frustrating when this happens.  Ergo, at this point i would like to discourage people who are considering buying this game due to the direction in which this game seems to be going",-1,1

While you're in the middle of an evacuation or skirmish and absolutely wrecking this monster, the game can suddenly decide to really ♥♥♥♥ you over and DC or just instantly crash. And naturally it doesn't save anything during your extermination so this can be pretty rage inducing. After an alpha AND beta you'd think they've fixed this buuuuut nope. Out of 10 matches I dced/crashed on 6 of them losing all my progress. + the mouse keeps ♥♥♥♥ing dissappearing... In it's current state I would not recommend it.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"So a few words about Evolve.  To begin with, this game has one of the most amazing ideas I’ve come across in any FPS and PvP game. You either play as the big badass monster or as one of the 4 Hunters, thus creating a 1v4 concept that can really blow your mind.  The real question about any game though isn’t how fun the idea is, but rather, how much does the fun last, especially in an Online game such as Evolve. So, let’s talk about some pros and cons for this game to get more into that matter:  The Pros List: 1) The premise upon which this game is built is mind-blowing and exciting. Hunters versus Monster thrown into a quite big PvP arena, each side with its own strengths and weaknesses. 2) Amazing graphics and great voice-over suck you into the game straight away, creating a great atmosphere of feeling either the hunted or the hunter. 3) Well thought mechanics for both Monsters and Hunters, requiring smart plays, on both sides, to be able to win. 4) 3 Different Monsters (with a 4th coming up) with different playstyles  5) 12 Different Hunters (3 for each class) and more coming up, each one unique in his role, than the rest, offering great depth to this game.   The Cons List: The game is far from polished, meaning not only the bugs you’ll encounter still lingering around but also matchmaking and balance issues that end up being really disrupting for the game experience. Let me emphasize a bit on the matchmaking and balance issues though: 1) The matchmaking of this game sucks: Have you ever wondered how it feels to have a game that asks for your role preferences and then goes and completely ignores them? Well that’s the case with Evolve at the moment. Evolve, asks you to pick your preference in a scale of 5, with 1 being your most preferred role and 5 your least wanted one and guess what, the game doesn’t seem to care at all. You join a game and the role you are given is very so often the last one you wanted to play.  2) 80% of the games you join are already started, while you are given the spot of a previous BOT (or AI if you prefer) player, usually without perks(starting buffs you get to choose, when you normally pick a role) and almost always, already in a very bad spot within the game, with your side, losing hard. If you choose to leave the game, you get 1 minute penalty (which isn’t much on its own) but trust me, it adds up pretty quickly when that happens 5+ games in a row, especially with all the loading screens you get to suffer each time.  3) Balance: There are a few issues here considering a few Hunter and Monster characters. Some Hunters being underpowered at this point (or pretty useless I should say) and some other characters being quite better on their specific role, giving you no real options when it comes to choosing what you are going to play. For the Monster side there is one Monster (Wraith) that, as it is now, rules them all. And the problem isn’t whether you win or lose, but whether you can actually have fun, winning or not. Well, that’s not the case when you play against the Wraith cause usually, the hunt sums up to the same pattern ,15 minutes chasing it, while being impossible to catch as pug hunters, then 2 minutes of it wrecking your team cause it reached Stage 3. Fun?  The balance issues are known to TRS and are said to be targeted with future balance patches and so. But, time is of the essence here and TRS doesn’t seem to believe so. Almost 2 months since game release but no balance patches yet (just a minor bug fix patch) while they spend their time announcing new maps and skins and characters (but I’ll get to that a bit later), leaving their player base overwhelmingly frustrated (27k players at Launch – 3k players 2 months later).  So overall balance and MM, are what kill the most out of the fun of this game. It simply won’t let you enjoy the game as you would like to, due to the game’s incompetence to respect your preference towards role and playstyle choices.  Money-making games and greed :  The game is getting 2 free maps at 30 of April (1 month from now) while Xbox players will be getting the content 31 of March, seems fair to me… Why? Probably cause Microsoft paid some huge money for their console to get priority… Also, while the game’s community dies fast, to the point of no return, what we only see, is more DLC and paid character packs coming out (25$ for 4 new hunter +15$ for a new monster), 2 months after people already paying 50$ to get the base game. That sounds pretty crap to me but I’ll leave that to everyone’s perception and pocket condition.   To wrap things up : Yes this game can be quite fun, but after a given time of probably 30 hours or so, you find yourself, getting more and more frustrated over issues that shouldn’t even exist in this game to begin with.  I wouldn’t recommend paying more than 25$ for this game especially when you consider the 40$ you have to pay to get the new content.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Alright, what can I say about this game that hasn't been mentioned already?  If you're like me, you ignored all of the negative reviews of this game because the core concept of the gameplay just seemed so irresistibly unique and interesting. If you're like me, and you're willing to ignore ALL OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS OF THIS GAME, just because the potential of the gameplay intrigues you, then let me talk to you a little bit about the gameplay that you may be oogling over right now.  --Simply put: it's not as fun as it may look. It's not very strategic. Very quickly it becomes highly one-dimensional, formulaic, and repetitive.   --There's only one 'balanced' gameplay mode, and that's HUNT. There is essentially no single-player.   --'Hunt,' unless you take it to a competitive level--GETS OLD FAST.  --Want to take your game to a competitive level, and you don't have three other friends IRL who also play the game? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.  --And, if by some miraculous chance you do manage to find three internet strangers that are also skilled, friendly, and willing to take the game to that competitive level with you, I must ask: HOW LONG IS THAT ONE GAME MODE GOING TO REMAIN FUN FOR YOU? I can tell you from personal experience that even if you do manage to get to that level, IT STILL GETS OLD FAST.  In a nutshell, that's the breakdown of the GAMEPLAY of Evolve--which is probably the only reason you're eyeing this game right now, after all. Now I'll get into the specifics of the game a bit more: ______________________   GAMEPLAY : There's no 'cat and mouse' strategic warfare going on here--90% of the time you are running as fast as you can toward the monster; and oh, that 10% of the time where you're actually 'hunting' the monster? You're hunting a wraith, and it's tedious--it's not fun.  When you're not running toward the monster, you are battling in a dome. Against a good monster, this will require incredible coordination and positioning between the hunters, which you, as a random solo-queue pubber, WILL NOT HAVE, AND GOOD LUCK FINDING OTHER SKILLED, FRIENDLY PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH. I'll talk about that a bit more later.   DLC : Just disgusting, disgusting. I'm not even going to talk about this, it's been beaten to death by everyone already, and rightly so. It makes me sick. 2K should be embarrassed. And now that the game has been priced down to $13 or $15 from the $60 I paid at release? F U 2K. That is all I can say. It's a SLAP IN THE FACE TO THOSE WHO PAID THE $60 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.   CONTENT : There's only one viable game mode. I've talked about this already. It gets old FAST.   'BALANCE' : This issue is notorious for Evolve. Personally, I think that the 'top-down' method of balancing that TR has instituted is in fact appropriate; balancing is addressed from the perspective of highly skilled players, and that is how it should be.   The last time TR adjusted balancing based on the perspective of random, solo-queue, no-talent pubbers, we were seeing such atrocious trash as 45 second dome cooldowns, absurdly OP hunter compositions, and a meta-game that WILDLY favored the hunters in competitive play.   The game is NOW closer to being balanced at higher levels of play, but due to the basic core concepts of the game--which are just not interesting or strategic enough, imo--Evolve will never be truly balanced.   MATCH-MAKING : Just awful. To me this has been the reason why I've finally had to turn away from this game, as much as I wanted to like it. Hunt 2.0 came far too late, and we need more statistics that determine a player's skill level than just a pathetic W/L rate.   I've told you in the section above that it's imperative to find friendly, communicative, skilled players to queue with. That is hard, and it takes a lot of time. It took me months to build a friends list of decent players and by that time most of those players were leaving Evolve anyway.   Personally, I have high standards when it comes to finding players that I enjoy gaming with--maybe it will be easier for you, I'm not sure. But I can't tell you how many players I've queued with that just relentlessly complain about the 'balance' of the game, rather than taking a long cold look in the mirror and admitting that they are unskilled.   Stop blaming the balance of the game, accurately assess your own skill level, what you could improve upon, and then find better players to queue with. It's that simple.    Evolve has been such a colossal waste of potential. Ignore this game at any price--it's more frustration than it's worth. If you buy this game you are letting 2K essentially get away with fraud.  TL;DR: REPETITIVE GAMEPLAY AND LACK OF CONTENT MAKE FOR AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS HARDLY WORTH $10, LET ALONE THE $60 THAT I PAID FOR IT.",-1,1

Does expanding (adding content to something already finished) a product that's not even being sold yet sound sensible to you? It's ridiculous.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I've removed my previous review because it is no longer valid. I reviewed the game with Monster Edition purchased and shortly before the game was launched with beta then afterwards. I put about 50 hours into the Stage 1 game and then another 40 odd hours into Stage 2. To put it bluntly, TRS has done an amazing job of a F2P port. See below.  The game costs nothign. Literally nothing as of 8/6/16. You can download the game and play for ABSOLUTELY free. There are no strings attached. You get to play the hunters and monster in rotation, but it's still FREE. Not one cent you have to pay for anything. This is a huge draw to the new player whom wants to get their feet wet in this glorious game. Yes, I said glorious because the game is such. It's something you don't see very often and other companies are now copying what TRS has developed with Evolve Stage 2.  Previously, the games were very much slower. When I say slower, I mean upwards of around 15 to 30 minutes per match at least. Nobody wanted to play Trapper since they were tasked with placing a dome around the monster and if the Trapper died, then the dome would be brought down. It's very easy for the monster to focus down one specific hunter even at the cost of their armor and some of their health. Now? Any hunter can dome. This major change has brought games from a 15 to 30 minute duration to a 5 to 15 minute duration and that's being very forgiving. The games are now such a length where people (myself included) can have a vested interest in the game and keep playing round after round if time permits.  Finding the monster used to be huge pain in the butt. I'm serious about that. It was possible for the monster to evade the hunters without ever being spoted until stage 3 when the monster is pummeling the power relay. It's easier now since the Trapper can use satellite beacon and get a general location of the monster. TRS has made the game possible for Hunters and Monsters to play rapidly if they choose to do so. A 30 minute investment game only to lose is EXTREMELY frustrating and you don't feel that when losing or even winning 5 to 10 minutes into the match.  The game is faster, more challenging when fighting and I absolutely love it. If you're reading this and are on the fence about the game then give it a shot and decide for yourself. Seriously, the game is free. FREE, no strings attached. Even if you don't have all the hunters or monsters and are playing 100% free then you still have a decent fighting chance. The game is designed to give you that chance.",1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Not even close to worth what it costs. It looks like a lot of fun going in, but your patience starts dwindling away as the monster wins every time you play online due to your teams poor organization skills. I would say this is a 'best to play with friends' game, but who am I ever going to be able to convince to spend 70$ on a game with barely any content.  Lets not even talk about all the DLC they're trying to push out too. I nearly crapped my pants laughing today when I found out that the fourth playable monster would cost me an extra 15$, on top of the 70$ I've already paid.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I really enjoyed the idea of evolve when I first saw it.  The idea of an extreme game of cat and mouse where the monster snuck by under the hunters radar was invigorating, the idea that a slip up could lead to a massive disadvantage or even death was amazing, and the thrill of outwitting your opponent was even better. There was a real thrill in matching wits and seeing whether the hunters could work together and tighten the net or wether the monster could slip a way, punching a hole in their formation or simply slinking away un-noticed.  The hunt was intense and thrilling, a slight mistake could spell disaster for either team and could really change the pace of a match.  Stage two has removed these aspects.  Evolve stage two has been simplified and shrunk into a game where the monster must run full sprint to hit stage 3, there is no more cat and mouse, no more sneaking, stealth is no longer a feature.  the game is now more about the skirmishes and fighting than the act of actually hunting one another.  The timer is restricting as even if a monster manages to outrun the hunters and pull a perfect game, he's basically left with 3 minutes to finish the match or he loses. And with the adjustments made to the hunters (passive healing, extra sheilding, ect.) the hunters are harder than ever to kill even at stage 3. The monsters virtually garunteed to take health damage, even with a perfect execution simply because in their attempt to simplify it for new players the dev's have devalued skill.  The games devolved into more of a brawl than anything else and for me personally thats dissapointing.  TLDR: The game used to be about nuance, wits, and skill made a huge difference.  The game is now about 4 hunters brawling it out with a monster with a little bit of chasing after in between.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"My Heartfelt Review on Stage 2 of Evolve  As of Octobor 25th, 2016, 2K has fired Turtle Rock Studios from working on Evolve Period with 2k Stating the game is Finished.  When I began playing this game, I loved it to death. The chasing, the comps, the monsters etc. Players were generally nice, many people helped others out and much more. After the disaster that was Legacy Evolve, the consistent updates were a huge blessing from TRS. They came out with new characters, new monster adapation, refactored some of the old monsters, and the PLANS this game had coming into it, man I was excited! TRS was ACTUALLY doing something to improve the game and the updates were AWESOME!  Then came the news above. TRS was fired from the game by 2K because they felt it was a waste of time. No more adaptions, adding more maps, adding ACTUAL LORE which was in development AND being helped by the community. The heart and soul of many players just broke after seeing what 2K did.   It is also unlikely they'll update the game with any of the future things that TRS were working on like a Wraith Adaption monster.  And so in conclusion and with great sadness, I do recommend this game, but not as much since 2K murdered the life of it. I will of course update this review if they ACTUALLY decide to work on it.  The forums are still alive if you feel like visiting and talking, some players will still remain to play together so enjoy it while it lasts.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"DLC on day 1 in unforgivable, period.   - DLC based cash cow.  - Claims to be good competitive, but it's just a casual game.  - 60$ for 2/3rds the content of a 25-30 dollar game.  - Playing as hunter: Chasing simulator for the first 2-10 minutes, then it's hope PUG people understand their role.  - Playing as monster: Run, Armour up, fight carefully, if failed to win, find a spot to lv up and repeat.  - Wraith seems quite broken, crazy burst, super mobile, hard to track, hard to punish and has a low CD ability that creates a clone that does high damage and the real Wraith becomes invisible for quite some time.   - Lazarus seems quite broken, he can rez even completely dead bodies every 10 or so seconds and do it out of stealth every 30 or so seconds and it doesn't even leave a strike. The Laz will just hide a mile away until people die then stealth in and rez them. If he used Laz device on a dead body it should add a strike, but if he uses it on someone in last stand it shouldn't IMO. Also, when he takes damage in stealth it should reveal him much longer IMO.   - Daisy seems EZ mode, just follow the doggy and find the monster who's hiding. Seems to mostly negate sneak strats, the best thing to do as monster is just run.  - Few things take real mechanical skill in this game. Aiming is easy because monsters are big. Playing the monster isn't as challenging as I'd hope. My only monster losses came from being forces to play it when I wanted to learn the game playing hunter and not knowing how to play Kraken, though I got forced into a losing game as Kraken for example.  - I'd rather there be 2 maps than 9 or what ever the game has honestly. No map stands out, it's just more to learn and annoying.  - The MM system is terrible. You set what role you prefer from most preffered to least, then when you search it trys to get your preffered roles first. I was under the impression that you would queue up for medic then get medic 100% of the time or monster etc.  - The lobby system is annoying and takes too long to get a game going or finish a match. I wish it was in and out. Takes about as long as ranked in League to start a game and even more time when it ends.  - Trapper can run through tunnels and ♥♥♥♥ spamming harpoons in front of them virtually ensuring they're impossible to catch so long as he has a good headset to know when you're trying to outplay him by cutting him off.   Summary: Massively over-hyped game that's worth about 30 dollars IMO for all 3 sets of hunters/monsters, but you pay 60$ for only 2 sets and the DLC for the 3rd set is way over priced, around 25$ I think, but see for yourself.

Brothers and sisters, there is no love to be had here, only mountains of DLC that no man can climb up without a mountain of green dollars. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter, and this encroachment of paid features in a sixty dollar videogame matters! Maybe one day, without 2K, EA, and their ilk, there will be a time where we are free from the shackles of DLC and microtransactions in our favorite hobby. And on that day, our nasally and out of tune choir will shout to the high heavens, 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank Gaben Almighty, we are free at last!'.",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"'Hey we didn't make enough money with our atrocious $120 pre-orders and 2 season passes, now we remove all your progress and make the game free-to-play with microtransactions, how about that?' The worst marketing ever seen in game industry combined with tedious gameplay and empty servers ruined the promising concept completely. And after the few loyal to the game learned how to get some enjoyment out of it, developers 'evolved' to stage 2. And by 'evolved' I mean they completely destroyed the good that was in the original. I understand why developers changed distribution model and I'm not against it. But Stage 2 is not even half as good as the original game. And Evolve wasn't good enough to begin with (hence free-to-play).  Also they've deleted all achievements. This is an outrage! How was that necessary? Removing the price tag was too simple for them? Or making a separate free-to-play product? We need to do something before this thing gets to stage 3.",-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"This game is the most depressing thing I've ever seen, It's a brilliant idea by a brilliant developer ruined by the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s controlling the DLC, I'm extremely conflicted, on one hand I want to support the idea nad turtle rock but on the other hand it's a hollow shell of a game that's sold one jigsaw piece at a time 'to give you options' as oppose to giving it to you or hell I'd be alright with that if a single monster doesn't cost £15 per and £7 per hunter, cause that's too damn much. you wanna make me buy a load of ♥♥♥♥ in your game AFTER I'VE BOUGHT YOUR GAME FOR £35 you better make it damn cheap, there are loads of examples of games were you can buy DLC that isn't terribly priced, many like dota, hearthstone that are free in the first place.   If they un♥♥♥♥ the DLC or they bring out a game of the year edition then buy it, I support that and then some and I'll buy it on the spot but until then, I beg you, don't buy this game and instead complain about it on every forum you can find, until 2K decide to pull their finger out and fix the DLC.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Honestly I have never really felt this ripped off by a game. Great concept, stupid price and little content. A little too rinse and repeate for me can't see this having a ton of staying power. Played a couple game and already felt like I was done.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I wanted to like this game. I wanted to like it so much that I spent 80 bucks on it. A month after release, nobody's playing it, and especially nobody's playing Monster. The game is so difficult to balance that they can't do it. And why would they, when everyone who will pay for the game already has.   They've released the new characters, and they're completely overpowering. They'll fix it eventually but the disparity is too broad - either they make it easy enough for the monster to hide, in which case the monster crushes the hunters, or the other way around. There's just too much to balance and not enough people playing.  I wish people would play and justify the money that I spent on this game, but it's never going to happen. Don't buy Evolve.",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,The game itself is a fun game. If you are a fan of L4D then this game is probably for you. As far as content this game is very simplistic like L4D was but there is also no option of using the community content. If the game allowed community content the company couldnt nickel and dime you like they are doing here. I have been following this game for a long time now and I am sad to say you should wait to buy this until there is the inevitable GOTY addition with all the content and at a fair price.    I am with the public on this and do not recommend this game due to the DLC practices. Day 1 DLC is never acceptable no matter how little it matters. The DLC model they chose to go with may or may not hurt them but I cannot recommend a 60$ game that charges so much for so little. Even with the PCMR edition at 100$ you dont get all content.,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I will try to be brief. Should you buy the game right now? No. Should you buy it when it's on sale? Yes, maybe.  Let's go over the pros first: 1. Visually the game looks decent. 2. The gameplay is more or less fun. When you finally catch up to the monster it can get pretty frantic and fun. When you are searching for the monster, that's where it becomes dull and boring. After 4.9h over the past 2 days, I cought myself thinking 'can I have some action please', when we were searching for the monster for 3 minutes streight yet again, and daisy was going back and forth in one sport without any indication whether she cought the tracks or the scent.  3. The character banter can get interesting. Well, that's about it, pros-wise.  I am not a big fan of playing as the monster. Although I do admit that it is more thrilling, and some pople might enjoy that aspect of the game way more than playing as the hunter. Being a monster is a tenser experience. You're constantly on the move, constantly looking for food, and trying to figure out how much time to feed you have, before you have to run, and then where is the perfect spot to evolve.  Cons: 1. The content. The content in this game is minimalistic. There is a short 'campaign', which is basically 5-rounds of various modes. You can beat it in around 40ish minutes. And that's it. There's scarsly any story, and I just can hope that Turtle Rock will eventually release additional campaign chapters that will make it more interesting. Other than that you are getting 16 maps, 3 monster characters, 4 hunter classes with 3 characters per class. You can't customise your characters beying the perk that you select before the round begins, or the skins that you buy from the shop, but we'll get to that later. Evolve claims to be an AAA title, yet, given the content that is avaiable in this $60 game, I can't really agree with this claim. A stale series such as CoD usually offers you a full campaign (aka story mode), multiplayer with a dozen of maps, a fair ammount of customisation for your character. BF does the same. Alternatively, games like Wolfenstein: TNO, or Bioshock offer you an immersive world with a strong story and a overall a memorable experience. And I can't really say that Evolve offers any of that. What it does offer if, is a shop, to go and buy tons of DLCs 2. DLCs. There is a LOT of DAY ONE DLC content that 2K is trying to sell you for additional fee. In fact, the shop looks like something that belongs in a F2P game. Some people defend the game buy saying 'well, you don't have to buy this content', 'it doesn't affect the gameplay', and even 'GW2, WoT and DOTA 2 have shops'. a) The fact that I don't have to buy all that content doesn't change the high probability that at some point this content was part of the base game .The sheer amount of it indicates that the customisation option is an innate part of the game, and at some point it was likely indluced in the game without the shop. Ripping contnet from the base game with intent to sell it on top for a $60 price tag, when the game on it's own is already a barebones product that doesn't shiny with an overwhelming ammount of conent to being with is just a poor sales practice. b) A comparison with likes of GW2 is also innacurate, because GW2, albeit a beast from different genre, had tons of content in the base game, something that Evolve, with it's 16 samey-looking maps can't boast. c) WoT and DOTA 2 and other F2P games don't require you to ponny-out $60 just to get in to the game, so it's only natural that those games will have shop. Finally, 2K's argument that allegeldy without that shop and ton of DLCs the game wouldn't be able to exist, is doubvious at best, when you see other AAA-titles brinning more content for the same $60.  ",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I played the alpha whatever thingy. And I will prefence this by saying I didn't much care for L4D2. And I'll get to why that matters in a second. But what I want to say goes beyond the bugs and load times and connection and preformance problems that are in a lot of alphas. Which were rampant in this one. I want to talk about the core of this game so here goes.  I do not like this game at it's core. What it is, is very shallow. Which is not the problem. But how it is executed is the problem, for me atleast. The premise is very simple, 4 hunters 1 monster trapped in a jungle, who will win. But what this leads to is a bunch of tedious running. Let's explain how the monsters work and what is truly wrong about this game to me.   The monster works like this you spawn in at stage 1. You can either kill all the hunters or destroy a power relay to win. But when you start you are generally to weak to kill them. But there are 2 more stages. Which you can get to by feeding on weaker creatures in the jungle. Stage 2 for most monsters, you are an even match and can win most fights if done correctly. Stage 3 you are an overpowered killing machine and unstoppable. They could tweek the monsters to balance them so that's not what I really want to get at.   The heart of my problem is the complete lack of variance in how you play a monster from stage to stage. And how they change the abilities of a monster stage to stage. And what I want to address are things I believe they will not change in the full release. You only become more powerful from stage to stage. There is no trade there is no cause and effect there is absolutely no reason not to hide and run until you get to stage 3. There is no thought to making the monster complex. Or thought of incentivising stages. Which means you spend almost every match running from spot to spot trying to catch up to something thats just as fast as you. And can scale cliffs faster than you and can cover it's track almost completely.  Now for the L4D2 comparison. The reason I didn't like that game is similar to why I don't like this, and wouldn't you know it the same people made both. Both games make a huge emphasis on the maps you play on. Not what you do on them. They spread and spiral, but there's not really much substance. You run and run but you really get no where. Both games use this long slog through nothing to create the illusion of accomplishment. When really you just spent 20 minutes with sub par combat on a sub par map, running. That's all you do. None of the guns in either game feel particularly good. And both games are entirely dependent on having a full team of people who know exactly what they are doing for it to work at all. Which let's be honest doesn't happen a lot of the time in any online multiplayer. If you're not playing with friends that is. Which means that this game like L4D2 will be relagated to, friend only play. For a lot of people. Which for the love of god take into consideration before blowing $60 on this game.   I am not by any stretch of the imagination saying this game is terrible. I am not even saying don't ever buy it. But what I am saying is don't hype buy. This game is, to me one of those games that is only as fun as you make it. And considering there are a lot of games that will give you fun co-op play at a much lower price. Then why drop $60 on this. I feel that like Titan Fall this games hype will be short lived. As people slowly realize this game has as much substance as a glass of water.  Now I think mindlessly criticizing is pointless. If you do not have a clear idea what you want and what would make the game better. You are basiclly just being a picky child who stubbornly refuses to eat his vegatables. So I'd like to speak my peace on that front.  There are many things they could do even now that would push the game towards what I'd want. I just don't think they'll do any of them. Even now they could, --'completely get rid of the power relay'--. The relay is pointless and slows possible combat with the monster. Why push the pace now, when you can get to stage 3 and force them to meet you when you are more powerful than them? I mean think about it. Imagne there's no relay the monsters at stage 3 now he actually has to hunt the hunters. it would completely flip the dynamics on there head. And make the game more interesting.  --'Keep the stupid relay'-- but make it physically impossible for stage 3 monsters to get to it meaning you can only attack the relay at stage 1 and 2. And making the desicion to go to stage 3 a risk reward decision where you have to find and kill the hunters  Another thing if, oh no the magical relay to import to get rid of -- 'Greatly reduce the speed and mobility of stage 3 monsters'-- at this point it's just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid you just stand no chance againt a stage 3 monster with the relays. if he gets to stage 3 you've already lost you just have to sit there and watch him destroy the relay. And die.  What I really want, which is albeit a lot harder at this point because they've already kind of commited to monsters and their design --'Give me a real reason to stay in Stage 1 and 2!!!'-- I mean the lack of thought in this, what I'd consider the most important part of the game is kind of shamful on their part. But this is how I believe the monster should be built, and funnily enough it utilizes some L4D2 elements. To me stage 1 should be all about stealth, shush moron and read on because. What the game does now is NOT, that. And NOT, what I mean. I mean stealth in the true sense. I do not believe stage 1 monster should leave foot prints, or be able to be trapped in the bubble. And should be able to cloak, and  have a move akin to the jocky in L4D2 which would also cut off in game mic. Now is that not more intersting than running and eating things? Having the ability to watch and hide and wait for someone to lag behind, then strike. To have an actual reason to stay, for atleast a period of time in stage 1. Stage 2 I'd say it's fine the way it is for the most part a balanced fight good mix of power and speed both sides should have a chance of winning a head on fight. Stage 3 should have some sort or negatives to the massive power increase. There needs to be pros and cons. Not having them makes it pointless for hunters to play when the monster hits stage 3 why not just quit? it's like playing monoploy for another 3 hours after you had to mortgage every property but one. What's the point? And people will just start quiting out when monsters hit stage 3 if it's not balanced. Which will ruin all the weirdos fun who love this game the way it is only because they have some kind of power trip. Which trust me other people will not indulge for long.  But I mean honestly --'I do not understand the point of different mosters at all'-- . It should be 1 monster with a great verity of branching paths. Making multiple monsters just narrows what you can do in a single match! Which also makes the game boring because from the word go you know exactly where it's going. Where if there were only one monster, you'd have no idea what to expect each time you met the monster. Making it much more exciting when you met. I mean it is called evovle right? Why can't one monster 'evolve' into all of the bull crap monsters they are making? Why can I not see how the people I'm up against play first. And then deside what kind of monster I want? Just a thought.  I mean the reason I'm writing this is because I heard the hype. And I wanted it to be that good. And honestly it's just not.  It's a sub par game with mountains of potential, that will probably all be wasted. As they get on their own hype train, and ride that mofo straight to Titan Fall station. Just another sub par blip on the gaming radar. Oh well.  P.S it's no wonder they're blocking reviews until full release when a 3rd of reviews are negitive.  ",-1,1

",1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I really wanted to like this game, and at times I have a great deal. Sadly over-all I can't recommend the frustration I've experienced from this game to anyone else.  This is not going to be one of those reviews that bashes the game because of it's dlc policy. Abusive or not we're here to talk about the game as is and frankly there is plenty of diverse content to enjoy in this game. There are four character classes; Assault , Medic , Trapper, and Support and there's also the Monster class. Each of those classes have three different characters to enjoy it with. There's a medic who uses a TF 2 med gun to heal you but then there's also Lazerus who's best time to heal a character is actually after they are already down or dead. There are assault characters who are best up close and personal and assaulters who do their best damage at a distance. There are 15 characters in all to unlock and each one plays utterly different than the other. I can actually applaud the variety  I can also praise matches that go perfectly. There are times where you are the exact class you want for an entire Evacuation match (which is really 5 mini-matches rolled into one big instance) with a great team against a skilled monster. When it comes together Evolve is a lot of fun.  BUT Evolve doesn't come together all that often. The only way to start playing is to just enlist into a massive pool of random players and hope the game puts you into a match of your preference. You rate the classes on a scale of 1-5 which measures how much you want to play a give class. When you pick you preferences the game even promises to try and give you your top picks as often as possible. Total and utter bold faced lie:  I usually have the monster rated 5th in last. He or she (yes there are female monsters) plays just fine and is balanced enough as long as you're pretty crafty. After a long day at work where I have customers ganging up on me day and night I don't want to play a game in which a group of 4 does their best to gang up on me. That is my number one preference and I have felt it ignored at every chance it could. I've spent ten straight minutes joining and rejoining matches in the hopes that I wouldn't be thrown into a monster roll or a dead hunter and have quit without even playing a match. There is no way to indicate that you want to start on Day 1 and that you are willing to wait for a party as long as you get the position you want. Yes it's annoying watching impatient players come and go, but I'd rather do that than join a match as a level 1 Wraith already domed and down to half health.  There's a way to play Evolve strictly Co-op (the monster is AI controlled at all times) and this has sadly become my only option. The monster AI is good but also lacking in everything you want it to have. You want the monster to be like a Predator from the movies; giving you a mighty good chase only to lead you into a tunnel where you are BBQed by the crafty monster as he chargers threw your party like a bowling ball (I won once using this strategy). Sadly the AI doesn't have that resourcefulness and most matches are just you following the monster from feed sight to feed sight getting in a shot here or there till it reaches level 3.  What brought this review on was a repeating glitch I've been suffering from in Co-Op where I've finally said enough is enough. As stated before Evacuation matches go on for 5 days and saves the best XP and accolades for the end of the 5th day. I've been suffering from a glitch that for some reason ejects me from matches stating 'I am not signed into a profile so I'm not allowed to play' despite the fact that I'm on Day 3 already. I am thusly ejected from the match and miss out on the XP I deserve and since there is utterly no way to have any say about which match you join you've practically just wasted your time.  These problems can easily be fixed with a few patches and I am genuinely intrigued as to how this game will grow. Depending on who wins a day (the monster of the hunters) the game will introduce a pro-winner perk that'll change the game. The hunters can get AI buddies to follow you around or portals to transport you around the level while the monster will get increased wild life, more aggresive wildlife toward humans, ecetera. The perks sadly go away at the end of the match; I can't help but feel the loss of depth. Imagine if they carried over through-out the campaign? There could be massive amounts of angry wildlife, which are bombarded with a space laser that the humans saved. They need to expand Evacuation, possibly into an intergalatic monster war (there is a terraformed moon revolving around the planet so I'm assuming we'll get up there at some point.   I'm sorry for the massive length I only wanted to get every thought out and I thank you for reading if for some reason you did. I do like this game and I had some fun with it but in it's current state or at it's current price I can't recommend this game",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"------------- Update 2016 Jul 12 ------------ Came back to see if the game had improved with the FTP.... It has not. The game didnt' have much to it before, and most of the things that made it unique and occationally entertaining have been removed or dulled signifigantly. The game has gone from a series of hunts, which were occcationally tricky, to a rather dull multi stage fps.   My main problem with the game originally was that when you knew where the monster was, it was usually a extended game of follow the leader with the hunters trying to catch the faster monster. That hasn't changed, all they've done is remove the interconnected missions and the need to actually find the monster.   Can't believe I'm saying this, but the game's actually less fun than before. Devs really should have spent more time trying to make the core mechanics better than rushing this into FTP  ------------- Update 2015 Mar 26 ------------ With the new hunters coming in I wanted to see if the updates since launch had improved the game play at all. Sadly, they have not.  The game still feels like an extended game of tag where the hunters try to catch a monster, then immediately switch roles and try to avoid the monster or face getting chain stunned to death. It never feels like your hunting the monster, tracks and sign are easy for anyone to follow, most of the game is spent chasing the much faster monsters. There is the occasional chance to cut off a monster, but experienced players minimize these opportunities.  The thing I find most frustrating is that it NEVER feels like there's a balance, and the devs really don't know how to fix it. In the latest patch one of the characters I enjoyed playing, Cabot, received around a 50% nerf to his damage. He may have been slightly overpowered before, but a nerf that large screams lack of pre-testing or extreme over-reaction.  As much as I want to enjoy Evolve, I just find it an exercise in frustration. I've only been able to stand for a game or two during events, in order to unlock the rewards, before I want to play something else.  Still wish I passed on it at this point.   ------------- Original Review ------------- I was looking forward to playing Evolve last night but was seriously frustrated by a lot of the functionality in game.   You cannot skip the initial tutorial, or any video. The character's are all introduced this way but their skills are simple for the most part, and could be introduced by a static graphic. Instead every player needs to sit around for 2 minutes while these videos play. I was so frustrated at one point I actually ALT-F4'd out of the game in frustration just so I could skip one of the lengthy videos.  In addition, you need to score your 'Favored' classes, there's no option to NOT play a class. I had no desire to play the monster or assault last night, but was stuck with them on multiple occasions. This included being selected for the monster in back to back games in a campaign, which caused me to drop out in frustration.  Evolve has been compared to L4D's asymmetric gameplay, but it's a poor comparison. L4D built tension with tight areas, harassed the survivors with NPCs, and provided the Infected interesting ways to disrupt. There's no tension here, the neutral mobs only exist to provide a temporary buffs, food for the monster, or a minor annoyance.   I think the most frustrating part is there's very little incentive for the monster to engage until it's ready. This might be interesting gameplay for the monster, but it means that all the hunters are doing is trying to catch up/cut off the monster for 1-2 big fights. That means in a 10 minute game all the hunters are doing for 7-8 minutes is running around the map.   I can't say the fights are particularly engaging either. Most of the monster attacks cause a fair amount of knockback, and most of the CC/Deployables the hunters have can be instantly broken by a basic attack. As a result, all the hunters are doing is trying to avoid drawing the monsters attention, with the primary target being thrown around and CC'd to death with very little chance of evading.  The game may grow on me, but it wasn't worth the cost IMO.  ** Note ** The problem most people have is with the amount of DLC. Although I didn't have a problem when they announced the packages, since they were being upfront, I WAS disappointed to see a truck load of day 1 pay DLC not included. I stopped buying games from EA because of their practice of launching day 1, and microtransaction, DLC on full games. I will no longer be supporting 2K games after this.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"This is an Alpha &amp; Beta review. That means it is subject to change at the time of the official product release.  Evolve was iconic at E3. It delivered cutting-edge visuals with immersive gameplay. It also introduced a style of gameplay that has not been ventured into much by other developers.  At E3, Evolve was the next big thing. It was the successor to Valve's immensly popular Left4Dead franchise. But did it deliver its intended effect?  No.  The visuals are stunning, the physics are wicked, the concept is good and the mouse optimization (along with changing the color scheme on the mouse) when you play as different classes is the neatest thing I could ever imagine a game would have (though I was slightly confused initially, as I did not know the game could do that). Then, what went wrong?  The core gameplay. The core gameplay lacked most of the elements which make a game worth playing. Throwing in millions of dollars and thousands of hours of development to introduce nifty elements to the game failed to mask its complete failure at entertaining the player.  In my five hours in-game, I chased a raving leaping lunatic monkey relentlessly, occassionally cornering it and killing it. However, the amount of time spent in chasing the said monkey was so high, that it was not worth the kill. The hunters were disabled by the fact that the monster moved significantly faster than them and could easily elude them even at close ranges. Occasionally, we spent nearly three-quarters of an hour, searching for a monster that switched positions from corner to corner of the map, making it impossible for hunters to intercept or even reach remotely near.   Did you want to wait instead and set a trap for the monster near the power relay and kill him once he arrived there as a stage 3 beast? Too bad he had full armor at that stage, his hits dealt 3x damage and the power relay had very little health.  Trapping the monster in a portable dome didn't help either, because he'd lunge around the dome till it ran out and escape, leaving you chasing him for another half-hour. Additionally, to the monster's advantage, there was no time limit on how long each round would take, so the monster could eat and elude at his leisure and take his sweet time destroying the power relay.  Lastly, the FOV of the game felt slightly absurd and personally for me, induced mild motion sickness, so that's a disclaimer for anyone wishing to try the game.  By the end, the game made me feel as bitter as this review is.",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Firstly, let me start by stating : I love the game. The design is great, the characters are fun and interesting and the game modes are entertaining and challenging - albeit some could do with a bit of tweaking. The gameplay is great.  The packaging however is truly godawful. Even without mentioning the horrific balls up that is the DLC, everything around the game is shoddy and desperate.    Unskipable FMVs. I thought we were past this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that forced everyone to delete the file in their install directory.   Matchmaking. Please, my god, don't match on experience. It means nothing if I can grind XP in solo matches but am actually useless in a game against human players. I won't even talk about the being unable to actually pick the class you want, or the fact there's barely any penalty for leaving an inprogress game. You know those people who haven't lost a game? Its because they leave if they're losing... which brings me on to   Competition. Ranking boards that rank on WINS? So if I grind enough, i'll be top, even if i'm truly godawful? Fantastic. You can compete with your friends to see how many games you play. Any form of serious ranking would be a godsend - even just an automatic loss for quitting an improgress game.   Game Finding. No, I don't want to join a game as the monster where he's 2 bars from death and stuck in an arena. No I don't want to join a game where i'm in a team of complete AI against a human. That's what solo is for.   Game Choice. I fancy a nice Nest game. Oh no, sorry, you have to play a full 5 round game to have a good shot of getting one of those games. But its ok, your team mates will probably leave if you lose a round. So it's back to solo.   DLC - because obligatory corporate moneygrabbing is what all the cool kids are doing.  tl;dr - great gameplay, ♥♥♥♥ wrapping, even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ publishing. Unless they do some serious reworking, I wouldn't recommend it.  ",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Heartbroken by the decision of 2k to stop production of the game.  The game had great potential, the concept of 4 hunters (Trapper, Medic, Assault, Support) each with a different role and each with unique abilities trying to hunt a monster before it gets too strong to kill. A monster that is weak in the beginning having to hunt &amp; consume wildlife to Evolve and grow stronger, strong enough to destroy a generator defended by the hunters or kill all of the hunters before the time runs out.   I bought the game before it was free to play, and I still think it's worth every cent... But...  The decision of 2k to fire TurtleRock Studios effectively shutting down production of the game left me genuinely devastated, I first heard this news from the YouTuber Grizzlemarine, and he was quite upset, and I get that. Even going as far as to create a petition to try and get the game to be available in console. When you follow a game from the beginning, watching how much the game grew and how the awesome developers were at constantly fixing bugs and introducing new characters and monsters, just to have it suddenly end like this...it just doesn't seem right, the devs' were awesome at their jobs and its just really unfair for them.  I'm sure the true fans of evolve will still come back to this game, but we all know it won't be the same.  R.i.P Evolve",1,0

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"One giant monster. Four hunters. Hunters chase monster, and if the game goes on long enough, monster chases hunters. Sort of. The game changes the objective of the hunters to defend a point when the monster hits stage 3 of evolution, which should really be called the '♥♥♥♥ the Hunters So Hard' stage.   All in all, that is the entirety of the game, a game that costs 60 USD, and doesn't really deserve to.  Is it fun? Sort of. Between in game voice chat bugs, a cursor that just wont quit in game, and a sense of general balance issues here and there, the game has a lot of problems. The core idea of the game is a good one, and has potential to be fun. Killing Floor and Orion Prelude have similar ideas, and both are a hell of a time.   However, this game has more problems than good to it right now, a problem that I can't say for certain will be fixed.  As far as the ludicrous DLC amounts, look no further than the 99.99 USD PC Monster Race pack, that gives a fifth playable monster, two aditional hunters and four monster skins. It also includes the base game, but that is a lot for release day DLC in a game that lacks as much content even when compared to 'free to play' MMORPGs by Aria Games (somewhat legendary in their lack of content in games), and even worse, when compared to the often times $1 Orion: Prelude where at least you can enjoy the sensation of killing dinosaurs, across more maps. Bare in mind that the fact that it costs 60 base, they are asking 40 for the privelage to play an entire monster type and two hunters.  If you, like me, bought this game; I am sorry, but at least you weren't the only one, and assuming the bugs get worked out, it can even be considered a good time. I will still be playing it occasionally, if for no other reason than a boost to my own self esteem, a desperate ploy to make me feel like I did not waste my money. If you were lucky enough not to, don't. Wait on it, and see if this game becomes worth the $60 price tag or not.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve... I don't even know where to start.  Well let's start at the beginning. I started playing when the game was in Beta, I was so hyped for this game I did not play anything else, showed it off to everyone because it simply was awesome.  And it still, don't get me wrong but the game has changed over the time, in a way that it broke my heart.  First off, the game died fairly fast you really noticed how it took longer and longer to get a game...  So lets get to my usualy Review Form...  POSITIVE: - The graphics are good, the perfomance is alright - This game is a very strategic game, even though it is 4vs1 you need to stay coordinated - There are lots of maps, and Neutral monster which can change the end of the game  NEGATIVE: - The Devs do not care about anything happening in this game, reports (Players or Bugs), Balancing issues or even plain communication - As already mentioned the game is pretty dead - There are a lot of buggs in this game - There is a low supply on content in this game (and when there is you need to pay for it   MICROTRANSACTIONS - do not get me started... there are a lot of new characters which all cost around 5$? maybe? which is unreasonably overpriced for a game that costed 60$...    I really tried my best here, I have put quite some time in the Beta, and in this game, I never stopped coming back hoping for the day where everything will be good again... This day apparently never came...  If the game would not be as dead as it is, i would recommend it to new players, but since this is not the case you will just waste your money here.  CONCLUSION:  I can only agree to the other reviews, saying that game WAS nice, but it went down on quality drasticly.. The game had an uniqe aspect, there were not many games like this out, and it was something new something that a lot of people loved... But the devs decided to ruin that   Do not buy this game.. it's not worth it....anymore.....",-1,1

Who doesn't have L4D by now, since it was free awhile ago. That isn't even the main issue. The issue is the fact that it is horrendously overpriced. There's no debating that this game is overpriced. It's a $60 dollar game that heavily relies on the MP aspect and the community. On top of that, the DLC is ridiculous. 20 dollars just for 3 playable characters. I would definitely wait for the inevitable GOTY sale, however, by then the game will have most likely died and there'd be no reason to pick up the game since the game relies too much on MP.  I have no doubt this game is fun and amazing, but the fact that it's overpriced at 60 dollars, 100 dollars for the full experience, while completly relying on MP, just makes me do a full 180.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Ffter F2P F2P model fixed low amount of players issue. There are still old and new problems about the game:  * Poor matchmaking: despite of 20-50k people playing matchmaking system still can't guarantee 'fair' teams. You can get really newbie hunters against you and snowball them at stage 1 or you can get elite premade team who will do flawless victory. Rarely, you can see something close to fair matchmaking.   * Disbalance: Okey-okey, many games have it and don't care. But really, some monsters are too strong and some hunters are really useless. Playing dozen hours I found out that there are actually few popular sets in terms of hunters team.  * Bugs: you still can stuck, yeah, playing a monster you still can stuck - even after 2 years they couldn't fix it. But lets cosider you move carefully (moving system buggy by itself). How do you like losing your ranking point after actually winning ranking match? Such bugs are so motivating!  * Poor gameplay: One game mode is actually boring to play again and again. After checking different monsters and hunters you find yourself doing the same stuff constantly, running the same way, shooting the same target etc. This game really misses variety.  Before F2P I would not recommend this game because of:  * Dead MP: I tried the game free weekend time and there were 4k players online only. It took more time to get team ready than match lasted, for example, 12 minutes of waiting and 8 minutes for a match.  * Poor matchmaking: You can take low level players versus expirienced monster and vice versa. I got into matches that last 1.5 mitutes only because of monster had no idea what to do and, on the other hand, I played with people who don't understand how to play vs incredibly elusive monster.  * Disbalance: Lvl 3 monsters look overpowered. There are monsters that can be invisible or can fly so you can't really touch them. Do you want another monster or hunter - please, pay more =)  * Poor gameplay: you either look for monster to trap and kill it or you run away as a monster to eat and kill'em'all in hunt mode. There are 4 game modes at time when I write it but I can't check and 'enjoy' them all because of dead MP.  * Price: really, even with 50% discount I will never buy such game - thanks to free weekend.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve is the recent game to be added to Turtle Rock Studio's small collection of games. Most known for their development of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, they have yet again tried something new with the development of Evolve. This game carries a lot of controversy mainly in regards to the price range. I agree with the concerns of the price point of this game and the amount of content you get for such a price. Do I believe the game is worth $60.00? No. Plus the additional editions which can raise the price up to 20 dollars or even an additional 40 dollars? No. You might be wondering what Turtle Rock Studios is offering you for such a price. Let me go ahead and tell you what you get.  For $60.00, you'll get the base game, nothing less, nothing more. 12 characters, four game modes, and three monsters. Pre-ordering the game gave you a copy of Left 4 Dead and magma skins for the monsters.   $80.00 got you the Evolve Digital Deluxe edition. This includes the base game plus the Evolve Hunting Season Pass which includes four new hunters at a future date.   $100.00 gets you the Evolve PC Monster Race edition. This includes the base game, the season pass, a fifth playable monster called the Behemoth at a future date, the magma skins as well as the four new characters. I do not believe that this comes with all of the optional skins, it may or may not.  Whether or not you're willing to spend that much for the items I just listed is up to you. For me, it isn't enough. I believe that the behemoth is a ploy to keep you from trading away the game.   Gameplay-wise, how is the game? Well, the gameplay of Evolve is tense and very smooth. The characters are very easy to control as well as use. Although some of the characters are harder to use than others, everyone has the skills necessary to learn and perfect a class with a little time and effort. The game does come with a tutorial for every hunter and monster that you unlock. This makes it easier for you to understand how to play a match with your characters. The AI has been drastically increased from that of Left 4 Dead. When playing Evacuation mode you have the option to play with a group of four other players against an AI controlled monster. Or four players against a human controlled monster. The AI controlled monster is pretty much hard mode as it does target those important hunters first making the coordination of your team crucial.   Without communication in this game, you're doomed to fail. By default, you can ping with the q button. This will make a ping noise and mark in the area where your crosshair is pointed. A necessary tool for those with and without communication. Although microphones are always best. This game is better played with a group of friends as opposed to random players.   But what about the actual hunters and monsters? Is there any point to upgrading? Yes. As stated earlier, the base game gives you 12 hunters and 3 monsters listed below. Each of the hunters have flaws and unique abilities that make them special.   Medic Class: Val - First  Lazarus - Second Caira - Third  Support Class: Hank - First Bucket - Second Cabot - Third  Trapper Class: Maggie &amp; Daisy - First Griffin - Second Abe - Third  Assault Class:  Markov - First Hyde - Second Parnell - Third  Monster Class: Goliath - First Kraken - Second  Wraith - Third  The game modes consist of the regular hunt mode, survivor rescue, defend, and Nest.   Hunt - Goal: Hunters vs Monster, monster must reach level 3 in order to destroy the relay or kill the hunters. Hunters must kill the monster.  Rescue - Goal: Hunters must rescue and escort the survivors to an extraction point. The monster must kill a certain amount of survivors or kill the hunters.  Nest - Goal: Hunters must destroy a certain amount of eggs before the monster is able to hatch or kill the hunters.  Defend - Goal: The monster must destroy all three of the hunter's generators before the time reaches 0. The hunters must defend their generator until the time limit is up or kill the monster.  My personal feelings for the modes are below.  Hunt - Fun, fair, cat and mouse mode.  Nest - Hunter-sided if you have a team that knows what they're doing.  Rescue - Fair as long as the monster isn't an idiot. Defend - Monster-sided, the monster has respawning minons every 30 seconds, and the hunter's generators cannot regenerate power.   What about the gameplay? What can this game possibly offer to make you continously interested? Well, people are right to have fears about being bored of this game after several hours of gameplay. It really is the same thing over and over again and it does get boring. I didn't expect to get bored of this game so soon, but I did.   There are several mechanics in this game that just make me believe this game is a cash-in from Turtle Rock Studios.   Day one DLC, skins. Why? For a game that is 60 dollars there must be some sort of replayability right? Wrong. The replayability that comes with this game eventually turns into a grind to get 'elite' status for a character. This begins a series of questions for the terrible matchmaking. Here are a series of issues I have with the game to sum up this review.  #1. Why are we restricted from filtering out certain monsters from a 'server'? Not everyone wants to play against a certain type of monster, in my scenario and almost anyone else's, wraith. It's such a lame monster. High damage, and high evading capabilities. It's also a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to track making the match a grind and forcing people to resort to abandoning a server if they are just not in the mood to go through the process.   #2. Why are we restricted from having a party member be allowed to be the monster? If your worries pertain to something along the lines of 'well, you can sit there and grind elites with your friends and cheat experience', then that's invalid. You're able to create a customized match and set the map settings to pretty in depth settings. The thing about these customized servers that only your party can join is that you can still gain regular experience and character progression. So if you need 900 direct hits with Parnell's rocket launcher to reach your elite skin, no worries! Just grab a buddy, set the game to monster favored, set the strikes to 0, and have him kill your AI partners. Once done, feel free to hammer away and exploit the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ elite skin game design.   #3. Why is our only means of customization through the elite skins? Yes, I get that you can purchase weapon skins and a couple skins for the monsters but why? Why isn't something like that already in the game? For Turtle Rock Studios to hold the Behemoth and extra four hunters until a later date, you'd want to be continously interested in the game. You wouldn't want to get bored so fast into to the game. Sure, there are perks that you unlock as you get further into levels, you can also customize a badge with little pieces and different colors as you progress through levels. But that kind of stuff doesn't give me something to work for. I don't log into a game and say 'yes, I can't wait to play all day and unlock this particular badge piece.' I'd want to sit there and randomly stumble upon different skins and such.  #4. Why do the characters feel so limited as to what they could do? They should at least have different loadouts in which you can fool around with. It really makes the game feel empty. Val only gets this and that, Markov only gets that and that. There's no mixing up their weapons with other class specific items. I'm not saying have Markov have the ability to use Parnell's super soldier or shotgun. Give each hunter unique skills that they can reassign and fool around with.   #5. What is so hard about making an efficient matchmaking system? Many other game devs have been able to pull off a decent matchmaking server. I'm tired of having monster so far away from first place and the game constantly makes me the monster.   ",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"There isn't enough content to justify the game's price, and on top of that, they are selling day one DLCs and have microtransactions in the game. If it was F2P, that would be ok, but it's $60 minimum, disgusting.",-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve is really fun for about two hours, but for a full price AAA title Evolve is so vastly lacking in content, diversity, strategic depth, and general charisma.  The game's biggest problem is its formulaic nature. There is one way every Hunt match plays out. The monster tries to avoid combat until it evolves to level 3. The hunters try to find the monster before it can evolve. This is the game. Unlike other games that allow for perhaps an early sneak attack (Zerg rush!) or unorthodox strategies, Evolve only allows for one way of play. You will conform or you will lose.  Apart from the signature Hunt mode, the 'campaign' mode takes about a hour to finish. This mode could have been pretty interesting, with a real story and meaningful choices. Rather, it is just a string of 5 matches in a row with lip service to story. Think Titanfall's campaign but somehow worse.  The other game modes are very slight variations on Hunt that clearly were thrown together without much thought. Rescue in particular is so very poorly balanced with the Monster given competing goals of trying to evolve but also forced to immediately attack the Hunters.  This game could have been so much more. There is so much potential in the concept. It took Turtle Rock years just to come up with a barebones experience with formulaic matches. The unlock progression system is also of the extremely grindy variant that gives mathematical advantages to obsessive players and discourages new players.  Then there's the day one DLC and in-game DLC store despite asking full price up front. An abomination.  In conclusion, when Call of Duty has the decency to give us a full 10 hour SP campaign, a distinct Coop mode, and a full-fledged MP mode, Evolve's one gimmick game design just doesn't stand up to the competition. But hey, those first two hours were fun!",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Everyone says the price isn’t worth the game...and they are right, the amount of features you get for the large price tag for just the basic game is ridiculousness then add on that the extra $ for the DLC. This game should be either a 50$ tops or a free to play game.  However the price of the game does not define if its good or not.....as much as I would love to say everyone come buy this game they really shouldn’t, here is why:  ~ GUI bug's: while these are not game breaking it is a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ as you will face having a mouse cursor while you run around as a hunter and no mouse at all when you are in menus making it hard to change classes and perks.  ~Monsters: Although it is clear that Monsters are supposed to be powerful, the biggest issue is that two of them (Wraith and Kraken) have such an easy time running away from the hunters so that they can ignore stealth almost altogether in favour of simply running away so unless your trapper is A class and you have a team with great teamwork (In a public game what are the chances of that?) You simply wont catch them or catch them long enough until they are rank3 and have no issue taking out your party  ~Humans: A couple of hunters have issues that should have been picked up in Beta but for some reason they got ignored for example Cabot (main character I play) his rail gun is supposed to shoot through walls to hit the monster yet what they dont say is that it only seems to work if the monster is pressed up against the wall you are shooting into, not only that but for a rail gun you would assume that the weapon would have no range limitations however it seems that it does making it frustrating. Hyde for some reason was given a grenade that is supposed to cause a puff of toxic smoke to hurt the monster if it stays in place not only does it do such a little amount of damage its a pain to rank up, other plays will hate you for it because the visibility issues it gives the other hunters makes it more of a disadvantage then advantage (There are more but I am trying to save on boring anyone kind enough to read this).    Long and the short of it...this game would be good fun with a group of friends playing with Mic's having a few beers making it worth the bugs and the oddities with the game but in random public games it just isn’t worth your time or your money until they fix what they should have fixed in the Beta.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve is a disappointment, and I don't say that because the game is a catastrophe, quite the opposite, the game is a disappointment because so much effort was put into making a game that could be so much better; I'm writing this review a little more than a month into 2016 and the community was on life support well over 6 months ago. I'm going to start off with what's great about the game:  -It's easy to learn, but there's room for mastery. This has its costs and benefits, the obvious benefit is that the game is accessible to newer players, but this isn't to disparage other games with massive skill curves, initial hurdles like that can allow for beautifully complex gameplay, but thankfully Evolve doesn't shoehorn in complexity where none is necessary or enjoyable. The monster and hunters each have a short set of weapons that fulfill unique roles, instead of a multitude of tools that are largely redundant, instead of trying to learn a massive list of rock-papers-scissors you just need to figure out how to appropriately use the tools you have.  -It's got variety. People take this for granted, but the developers actually did a great job of varying the abilities of monsters, the weapons and aesthetics of hunters, and so on. People don't complain about every hunter being the same, or having the same kind of weapon, or every monster having the exact same abilities, but you can bet they would (and rightfully so) if the devs had neglected this aspect of the game. -Maps, and this goes back to the previous point to some extent, Evolve actually has quite a few maps- enough that you'll get tired of the gameplay before you ever get tired of the setpiece  for  that gameplay.  -It looks pretty good, graphics aren't a dealbreaker but I can appreciate the immense effort that went into modelling, texturing, etc. to make this game look good without requiring a super computer to run it. Just from examining the environment, equipment, wildlife, hunters, or monsters, you won't conclude that the devs cut corners, no, to reach that conclusion you'll have to actually play the game.   So, why is the game a disappointment? Two reasons: balance and community. The latter problem, the community, is not technically a problem with the game itself, but this is a multiplayer game and matchmaking can take quite some time, so I hope you've got something to do while the game looks for a match (especially if you prefer to play monster.) Balance, what's wrong with balance? Well, all of the maps are understandably somewhat small, if they were significantly larger it would essentially mean that if a monster broke line of sight long enough it'd be able to escape the hunters for the whole round, some maps however are extremely small (Broken Hill Foundry) and are nearly unwinnable for the monster- if you take Wraith whose whole build is predicated on stealth and you get stuck in a ♥♥♥♥ map like that you are screwed, sure, there's some difficult choke points for the hunters, but that doesn't really matter if you're a level 1 Wraith with no survivability and unimpressive damage dealing abilities. When I played about a year ago (less than that, but not by much) the semi-competent monsters would usually stomp pubs, but any competent team of hunters would win the vast majority of games against even competent monsters. At this point, it seems like any team of pubs can just stomp the monster, at least the Wraith at this point which has been nerfed quite significantly since I last played. This is ridiculous considering the fact that competent hunters were already favored in a head to head match, because if they used their abilities like sound spikes and sending track darts into prey the monster will likely eat there's no chance the monster can sneak around until they get to max strength like I sometimes used to get away with. Maybe the players are much better now (certainly doesn't seem that way,) but I think monsters have been nerfed into the ground, the basic reasoning by the devs being that it's better to have 4 medicore players hunting the monster leave satisfied than to have 1 competent monster beat out 4 mediocre hunters who can't work together. I think the problem with the devs attempts at balancing is they base their attempts at balancing off of win rates and statistics, but not from actually watching gameplay. If competent hunters beat competent monsters 80% of the time, this would suggest to me that the game is unbalanced (hypothetically.) If comptent monsters beat incompetent teams of hunters 80% of the time, this suggests to me the obvious fact that when you have two equally powerful machines (a monster/vs a 4 man team of hunters) and the latter 'machine' (hunters) has 4 'moving parts' (players) that can fail, it stands to reason that  if the game is actually balanced, the monster should win the majority of the time  because it's far more likely that one of the 'moving parts' is faulty in the hunter's team- yet, the devs aim towards a 50% win rate, which means they're aiming towards having monsters lose 50% of the time to a team of hunters which is 4 times more likely to contain an incompetent player- the target they consider balance will be biased against the monster because they fail to recognize that a fair match between 1 monster and 4 hunters should naturally favor the 1 monster- a monster doesn't need to worry about communicating with teammates or relying on them for success. Balancing the game off of win rates and shooting for 50% win rates will lead towards a bias against the monster, random teams of hunters that don't coordinate  should not  have a good chance against a competent monster. Imagine that in online chess one side consisted of one player, the other of four players who were not allowed to communicate at all- the one player is naturally going to be favored; now instead imagine that the four players have the option of communicating by microphone if they plan in advance, even then there's a good chance one of the four players will screw it up, meaning that although the game is balanced the single player will win more often; this line of thinking apparently has not crossed the minds of the developers, or they simply do not care to examine extensive amounts of gameplay at various skill levels to get a view of game balance that is more grounded in reality.   I wouldn't recommend this game unless you have 5 seriously interested friends with VERY consistent schedules, otherwise this will (almost certainly) be a waste of money, especially this late into the game's life.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"This is for the STAGE 2 Update, and if you should give the game a (second) chance.  Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBLqlAs09Vs   Text: Evolve suffered from massive issues going from unbalanced gameplay, to many game modes to manage and a non-existent player base to play them. The various monsters, DLC, Skins and unlocks only added to the commercial confusion for players that wanted to get into it.  Stage 2 does away with all of that: Everything is struck flat into a fairly straightforward unlock system using Silver Keys (ala Riot Points or Gold or other F2P currency) and you get some every match to upgrade your character, unlock new monsters and various skins as well. A much cleaner system that allows for people to get their feet wet and unlock things gradually, but not requiring a large up-front commitment.  The gameplay has also been rebalanced / redone in various ways. Firstly, all modes except 'hunt' are gone. This might upset some people, but i view as a good thing. It allowed focus on balancing one game mode to the best of their ability, instead of spreading resources to thin.  And they did a pretty damn good job so far. The gameplay changes have shifted a lot of the 'run 15 minutes and pray your trapper doesn't miss' or the 'dont let them find me until i'm LvL3 Evolved' into a more gradual shift in power and more interaction and combat between players and monster, with less stress and more teamwork for the hunters allowed a much less toxic experience.  Overall, i REALLY do suggest taking a second look at Evolve Stage 2. It's core hasn't changed, but it has received one of the best rebalance and business model changes I've seen in years.   ",1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"  TL;DR - a game of untapped potential soiled by poor execution and brand handeling over its lifetime     -Pros: -Atmospheric  -Interesting concept -Eyecatching character and monster designs -Competitive 4v1 - its a game unlike any other  -Cons: -Broken matchmaking system -Incredibly grindy to unlock anyone since the patch -Hard to learn - hard to master gameplay; a learning curve the size of a small skyscraper -Variations of characters flood the shop, full price for slight tweaks -A game that requires coordination and composure (not a bad thing), but never gives new players that chance -Off the cuff balancing that either incapacitates a character completely or raises one to godhood.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I want to like Evolve, I really do. The aesthetic is intriguing (albeit everything is quite gray), characters have suprising depth and relationships that are expanded upon during prep in cute little conversations, and the premise itself of a 4v1 gritty hunt is really interesting. But hot damn if it isn't easy to get the fun absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥tomped out of you by some rank 100+ monster.  Little backstory, I had convinced 3 of my friends to join me in playing Evolve Stage 2. I had played the game a little back during the beta for just 'Evolve', and my friends liked the L4D series enough to join me in experiencing the rebirth of Evolve. So we play the tutorial, do some bot matches and get the hang of some characters - generally having a pretty jolly old time. We finally decide to buckle up and begin our first real online match. We've all got our naked banners and brand new characters - naive smiles on our face. We aren't waiting long thankfully before a Behemoth shows up, but unfortunately the first monster we encounter has this glowing gold trimmed banner with three black claw marks - we're getting a little nervous since we had no idea what that meant, but we quickly learned that when that banner shows up, expect the game to wrap up preeeeetty damn quick. To cut this short; after evolving withing 3 minutes he brutally murded our crew one by one, leaving us feeling so dejected as this veteran has his way with our virgin booties. We kept trying though, and eventually we had 2 matches with people who were also brand spanking new.   It was still difficult, which is a good thing, the game should be challenging. But after we successfully hunted those 2 new monsters we left the matches feeling, how should I put it, tired. It was fun sure - but during that hunt everyone was silently focusing and making calls. I've never heard a VOIP server so quiet with people in it actively playing together. Fighting monsters feels like such a mudslinging battle. It is a tiring experience when we're winning, so you can imagine how draining and salt inducing it is to get smashed by a veteran. As of writing this, me and my crew are sitting at about maybe a 15% winrate? Thats being generous probably, but it has been a bloody salt soaked experience attempting to learn this game.  I know what you're thinking. We just started, we're expected to be bad. Keep practicing and you'll get better, work for your reward! I agree too, thats why we kept playing - we told ourselves, yeah we're bad, but lets keep at it and we'll eventually get better. Lets keep giving it a good ol' college try, its just a game after all! But holy hell, when the learning curve is the size of a small building and has 200+ hours on you its really hard to climb above it. Hell its hard enough to break that challenges armor yet alone win a game against it.   4v1 is extremely difficult to balance. Naturally the 4's are weaker indiviually than the 1 and rely on communication and coordination to overcome the 1 - and hell people on the subreddit for Evolve even complain the game is becoming too hunter-centric. How hunters are too strong and the monsters are getting shafted, but we've never seen that happen, the veterans have made sure of it. Hell, one gold skinned Behemoth took down our crew without even using his #4/Wall - at least that guy was a nice one, naturally with online games you'll have some bad apples - but thats besides the point.  Like I said, I want to like Evolve - its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interesting. But as long as we're stuck without a matchmaking system and some questionable balance choices (300% price increase on everything has really riled everyone up) we can't get into it. Unless you're having an incredible amount of fun getting your face stuffed in the dirt every round, you're time will be better spent elsewhere. Good luck taking the plunge, because you'll come out with some true grit if you hone yourself on this incredibly unstable game.",-1,1

275850,No Man's Sky,"This was my review prior to the 1.1 update ________________________________________________________________________________ 'This game has failed miserably, I am VERY annoyed that I am stuck with this garbage in my game library because it is completely terrible and I will most likely never play it again. When the game first came out it had over 200,000 players on at one point, now there is a mear 800. If that doesn't prove this game is the biggest scam of 2016 I don't know what does. The devs completely lied about countless features that were meant to be in this game.' ________________________________________________________________________________  I clearly had very strong feeling about the game after playing for about 40 or so hours, but now that Hello Games have released the new update I decided I needed to revist the game in order to see what sort of improvements were made.  Obviously the update doesn't add all the features we were told about before the game was launched, but it does add content that we had all hoped to receive and that's awesome. It shows that Hello Games have started taking a step in the right direction in hopes to fix their game. I really did enjoy the game when it first was released, but did quickly realize how much content was actually not in the game. It's very nice to see the developers going back to try fixing this by adding content many players were excited about.  Thoughts about the 1.1 update ______________________  Game Modes -------------- - The additon of game modes is very nice, I think it's a great way to allow different kinds of players to enjoy the game.  The three modes are  Normal - this is what most players who revisit the game will know, it's basically the same as before 1.1 but with the new content such as base building  Survival - Practically the same as normal, but with a very steep learning curve. I personally really loved the challenge, you start in a random location on a planet (from my multiple games I noticed all the planets had some sort of harsh environment), and in order to get your ship you have to gather materials and reach you ship (the ship seemed to be anywhere from 8-15 minutes away from your spawn location)  Creative - Much like creative mode in minecraft. You have god mode, and unlimited materials. It's a great mode for building up a base if you want to see what all you can do with it.  Base Building __________  - The base building is fun and simple. Being able to set up a planet as a 'home base' was something I was excited about from the start of the game, it's very simple and I can already tell how useful the bases will actually be. They will not be something you spend time on and then forget about within an hour.  - Hiring people from the different races is an interesting way to liven up the bases.  - As you hire people to work at your base they will give you missions to go gather materials in order to advance or learn how to make a new building, the 'base researches' is a great way to add somwhat of a 'questing system'.  - Within the bases it seems like you have you own personally space stations, which is very nice. No more flying back and forth once you fill up your ship with materials.  - Having a teleporter that can transport you from the space station to your base is actually very cool, I always hated having to fly to the space station just to buy some material I couldn't find on the planets easily.  Materials _______   - The new materials are interesting, I like the idea of needing to research certain equipment in order to harvest new materials.  - Some of the new materials require you to have sort of gauntlet in order to harvest, I think it's great that you now need more than just your multi-tool in order to fully harvest a planet for all of its worth.   As I said above I really enjoyed experiencing the new content and found it very simple yet enjoyable. I think it's great to see Hello Games finally make a comeback after letting down so many people, it's obvious they spent a lot of time on the new content in order to make it up to the older players and to make sure they gave quality content to their players.  ________________________________________________________________________________ This is probably the part where I start to get thumbs down because of my review ________________________________________________________________________________  After revisiting NMS and checking out the newest update I think 99% of the recent reviews on this game should be removed. They are clearly people who hardly tried the game before deciding they wanted to give it a negative review like everyone else. If you read their reviews they can't even tell you want they disliked about the game, how can you give a negative review but not explain what you disliked.  I think Hello Games did a great job with the 1.1 update, and I think that most of the negative reviews should be ignored until you get the check out the game yourself.   ",1,1

275850,No Man's Sky,"The 1.1 update is amazing. If you still have the game, give it another chance. I recommend it!  1.1, sadly, is how this game should have launched, with the promise of more to come afterward.   Great work Dev Team, keep it up!  Edit(12/17/2016):  I fell for the hype and purchased the game when it was nearly full price (I did use a coupon to lower the price before buying, because I never really buy games at full price). It was a mistake. The base game was great fun for about 4 hours, and then it fell apart when I started to see that the gameplay was overly repetative and the features were lacking.  This update brought many features that brought me back and had me playing for many of the hours I refused to invest in the first version of the game due to the fact that it just felt tedious.  I agree with many that the game should have been launched as a $20 or less indie game, rather than at a big budget cost.  I also agree that the 1.1 update brings some items to the game that should have bee there to begin with. As I said, 1.1 is how the game should have launched... and add that to the edited in comment about $20 dollars or less being the pricepoint.  They made a ton of mistakes in the marketing and launch of the game, however I have hope that it can still be made great long after the hype, and be enjoyable. I have hope that somehow they can patch in a large sum of content that might bring the value closer to the price point it launched at, however I know that is not very likely.  I am not forgiving the horrible marketing of this game, and far too early featureless release of the game. I'm just hoping they can keep adding to the game that I already own, and continue moving it in a direction that brings it closer to the hyped promises that brought me to purchase it early on at launch.  If only they had just called it an 'Early Access' alpha / beta, rather than a full release...",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"This game is 100% exploration. Hardly any combat to speak of. Progression is more abstract than concrete. It is solitary, mellow, and a touch repetitive. It's sort of like fact checking.  This is a game you probably know beforehand if you will like it or not.  I cannot stress enough, this game is ALL exploration. If you do not like exploration, if you don't have a sense of wanderlust, if you don't get gripped by a need to know things or by an air of mystery, you will not like this game.  This is a niche game. A very good niche game, but niche nonetheless. It does not appeal to everyone and I doubt it ever will.  Me though? I love it.  ---------EDIT--------- First off, I would like to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my review. Everything said has been hilarious at best and interesting at worst. I've never had a review “explode” like this before, so this is been kinda cool for me.  Anyways, a few further thoughts in response to other people's thoughts.  On the topic of the game not running/being bugged/bad port, I haven't experience this myself. I have an Intel i5-4590, nVidia GTX 970, and 12 GB RAM and I'm running the game 1920x1080, anti-aliasing OFF, anisotropic filtering 2, texture/shadow/generation/reflection all HIGH, and max FPS 30. With those specs/settings the game literally runs just fine for me. I've experienced no crashes and no bugs. Every now and then the game will hang up a second or two went I arrive somewhere new, but that's it for me. This has been a non-issue for me personally. I cannot comment on that aspect further.  As for missing gameplay features...this is also more of a non-issue for me personally. I personally don't care if I can see other people in the universe or not. I expected this game to be solitary, so it was what I expected. Aside from multiplayer features, I don't really know what else everyone is saying is lacking from the final release. I did not closely follow the pre-release buzz (because I was going to get this game anyways), so I am not informed as to what else was promised that is not present.  Concerns about repetition in relation to limited content and procedural generation are valid. True, the pool of parts the algorithms can pick from is rather tiny indeed. Many planets have a tendency to feel samey overall, and I would say that this is the weakest aspect of the game. However, I personally am willing to accept this limitation as a trade off for the game existing in the first place. I bushed along this this topic in the review above, but I will elaborate a little further: Exploring places that feel similar is a bad thing, yes, but I do not find this to be the focus. The focus is more abstract. I feel this game is more about exploration ITSELF rather than the results of the exploration.  Arguments about resource management I would say are half valid. From my experience so far, the resource gather is more “at your pace” than “at the game's pace.” If I want to sit around on a Moon mining gold and gathering a big reserve of Plutonium, I can. If I just want to grab enough fuel to hop to the next system, I can do that too. Your “day-to-day” resource requirements in the game are very low. You can easily get upgraded ships and multi-tools just by exploring and without ever mining for resources to sell. Even warp cells require very small amounts of resources. (50 Carbon, 100 Plutonium, 50 Heridium, 50 Zinc, and 100 Thamium9 in total if you make it from scratch. For reference, your suit's inventory slots have a maximum stack size of 250.) And with just a few upgrades to the multi-tool, mining is very fast. Furthermore, this game is secondarily a survival game, and resource management is an important aspect of survival gameplay. I do not see any problem with the resource system in game, since I feel like this is exactly what would happen in the world of No Man's Sky: decentralized harvesting/production of goods due to extremely advanced technology that allows individuals to be nomads and just grab elements they need to manufacture goods they need directly.  In close, I am still enjoying this game, and I anticipate any aspects will be fixed and expanded upon within the coming months. That said, if Hello Games DOESN'T get the PC port better optimized, then at least half the criticism leveled at them will be totally valid. Also, if they don't add more content, then I will certainly be disappointed. I do agree that $60 feels steep for a game “a mile wide and an inch deep,” but I myself personally paid full price as an way of “paying forward” further development and because I was very excited for an exploration game that veered more into hard sci-fi.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"This is a very educational game that teaches you the concepts of false advertising, as well as the consequences of pre-ordering video games. I’m sure glad I spent $60 to learn this valuable lesson, you can not get this kind of education anywhere else! ",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"16 hours played for me and it only came out today. O_O  Suffice to say I love this game. I've been following it for three years and it's just what I expected from it. Which seems to be for a lot of other people a problem, in that they expected things of it that it was never meant to be.   This is an exploration and survival game. It's as much art as game, it's like stepping inside an old fashioned Sci-fi book cover from the Asimov/Heinlein days. It's beautiful, stark, contemplative at times, harrowing at others.  I've seen this question asked about 47,000 times the last three years, what do you DO in No Man's Sky?  Simply put, you explore. Period. It's a vast universe of wonder and you're there to check it out.   Sometimes you'll shoot things, sometimes things will shoot back, sometimes pirates will try to spread your atoms across space, sometimes a kraken-dinosaur-squid will try to eat you, but none of that is what you do, it's just stuff that happens along the way. This game is about exploring and the wonder that is the universe. If that's boring to you, do not buy this game. If you have to shoot things every 5 seconds to be happy, do not buy this game.  This game is frequently mellow and contemplative. It's art, it's science, it's beauty, and occasionally it's a game, and that's enough for me and then some. There is no multiplayer (nor do I want any). It's you and the universe, go see what's there.   Thank you to Sean Murray and the Hello Games team for bringing my childhood dreams to life. Reading Heinlein and Asimov as a kid, playing the original Elite back in the 1980s, seeing those 'planets' in every space game for 30 years and knowing they're just painted textures and you can't go down to them. I ALWAYS wanted to go down to them, and I wanted them to be amazing, and now I can, and it's AWESOME. :D  Update: 3 days in, still love it.   But holy hell the venom and salt being spewed in the comments. I feel compelled to add a bit to my review to head some of that garbage off. You are allowed to NOT like or be interested in this game, just as I am allowed to like it. Suggesting that no one could possibly like this game is idiotic, clearly many of us do enjoy it very much.  More so than most games this is a niche game that will appeal to a very specific set of personal tastes. If it's your thing, you will LOVE it. If it's not, you will find it crushingly boring. Personally it's great for me and what I like, but it's not for everyone, maybe even not for most people.  If you aren't SURE this game is for you, then DO SOME RESEARCH. There are hundreds of let's play videos already up on youtube, you can see before you buy EXACTLY what the game is like. There is at this point no excuse for not knowing what you're getting with this game.  Whether it's worth $60 is a personal decision. For me, it is. Others may want to wait for a sale, yet others wouldn't like it even if it were free. There's plenty of material out there now to make an informed decision.  Update 2: Final thoughts:   2 weeks on, I'm basically done with the game now at 94 hours. I've exhausted the ugprade tree, perfect ship, perfect multitool, perfect suit. While I intend to revisit now and again just to check out new planets sometimes, game-wise I've done all it has to offer.  Since I know what's at the center of the galaxy is basically nothing, there's no strong compulsion left to play it a lot.   I still stand by my positive review, but I'll also agree the game as a whole is a missed opportunity. I enjoyed what it had to offer for about a week and a half, and then I exhausted it. It was a very enjoyable week and a half, but I had hoped for more.  94 hours for $60 is not bad at all, and I'm satisfied with my purchase, but I realize I'm very likely in the minority. This is an indie game and an impressive technical achievement, but they got greedy. It probably should've been $30 at most.   If they'd done that, plus been honest that this is a limited indie game and to temper people's expectations, I think it would've gone over much better with most people.  I remain hopeful they will continue to support this game, to add content and features. It's a promising start but clearly incomplete in many ways. I'll revisit it in the future and see what they've done to it. It would be a shame for something this promising to merely be abandoned because of a bad first impression.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"INTRO This review covers a lot of the political repercussions of the poor launch reception but also discusses some key game features and their improvements. The nature of this review can cause quite a controversy so read at your own risk.  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR IMPROVEMENT The game is much more likely to achive a greater improvement if the development team is motivated to improve it. Negative reinforcement alone is not a good motivator at all and in fact can leave the person or people in question unmotivated to do anything. I feel that if we want to see good improvements on this game we should give more support to the good features of the game but in so we must not forget the bad ones either.  GRINDING Well the game has a lot of grinding as do other games and the grinding can be fun, but if you are just playing the game to complete it, then the grinding becomes the main objective and it can become very boring, if you take your time to explore and scan creatures and appreciate some of the good ones then you can expect to have a nice evened out experience.  SIZE OF THE GAME The game is big, very big. The game consists of more planets than you will ever be able to set foot on so there is that but at the same time this is just kind of an illusion as you are going around from planet to planet, eventually you will realise that there is not a huge amount of variation amoungst the plannets. But, there is enough to give you that illusion if you let it, of course you can nit pick and look really closely and break the illusion but you are only doing that to yourself, take it like a picture best viewed from a certain distance.  EXPLORATION It is no lie that No Man's Sky has a veriety of means to produce novel situations to the player, this is wonderful and really helps drive your onwards, the creatures that you discover can be very different from one another. However, you need to take this with a pinch of salt, it can't be easy trying to populate a game with all kinds of new creatures when the game is as big as No Man's Sky. There is a wonderful video that explains how the creatures in No Man's Sky are made up, I recommend taking a look at it if you are interested.  STORY The game has an objective but also has freedom, the 'main' objective (if you want to call it that) is to get to the center of the universe, yes you can do that but you can also take your time in doing so, that is how I have played it and I am enjoying myself doing so, you can really immerse yourself along the way and enjoy the game as an exploration.  SPACE TRAVEL Who does not love space travel, and no mans sky does it wonderfully, I can fly down to a planet and blast off from one with no loading screen and I can explore a vast collection of star systems and fly wherever I want, the game does this brillinatly. The only drawback from this is the inavbillity to fly close to structures and terrain with your space craft, this really breaks the illusion of flight and makes it feel like you are being bubble wrapped and your hand is being held, maybe I want to crash into the ground!!  GROUND COMBAT The combat in the game is some of the weakest combat I have experienced in gaming. However, the combat is there, it exists and I am happy that they put it in the game, the ground combat at least gives me some sense of danger whilst you are roaming around on the ground doing your thing. However the ground combat is really easy and does not pose much of a threat, this could really do with a tweak.  SHIP COMBAT Well, the ship combat in the game is a different story, I personally like the ship combat with a pinch of salt but yet again, the inabillity to fly close to objects and terrain ruin it so much, I want to fear the ground and other objects as I battle it out in my ship, I want to use them to my advantage as I take risks by flying close to the ground so that my enemy struggles to keep up. Besides this immersion breaker, the ship combat is awesome and does what it says on the tin. However, it is few and far between, you are not going to be finding a lot of combat unless you go out looking for it and even when you do it can take a while to find it.  CRAFTING &amp; INVENTORY Of lord of lord, the crafting and inventory system needed a lot of work and work has been done. The inventory system was lacking to say the least and the crafting was simply combing two objects to make one, It felt very tacked on in the game. I am sorry Hello Games but this is one of the things that I couldn't stand in No Man's Sky and it needs an overhaul. I will however give it props that it does work and it does what it says on the tin so I can't complain too much, it is not somthing that will ruin your time playing No Man's Sky but sheesh, it could do with a little touch up.  VALUE A lot of people critise the game for its price and I completely get that, I do see how the game could be a bit too pricey, yes it is pretty costly but I am keeping my hopes up that with more and more updates the game will become worth the original money that I payed for it. The first update marks a great step towords a great game and I have faith that the updates will keep on rolling out  NOTE ON SUPPORT I know that the advertisement was really missleading and I know that the game was over hyped by a lot of people but if we keep throwing insults at the game just for the sake of it and just falling into confirmation bias, then all we will see is a crap game. Try not to be driven like a sheep with horse blinders on and make your own oppinion of the GAME and not the ADVERTISEMENT or POLOTICS that run with it. What we have here is a good game, its not the best game by any means but it is not a bad game at all. I have really enjoyed my time in No Man's Sky and will continue to play the game. Be unique and make your own oppinion of the game and don't follow the mass of people that are slandering the game for political reasons alone.  NOTE ON NEGATIVE REVIEWS The majority of negative reviews are unfortunatly the product of something called 'groupthink' (look it up) Where a large mass has come together and followed majority view and slandered the game without any real thought, in fact a lot of the reviews you will see have only reviewed this game, so you can see by this that they are just jumping on the band wagon and giving it a negative review. HOWEVER! before you go crazy on me, some of the negative reviews, in fact a LOT of the negative reviews highlight a lot of really helpful things that the development team can take action on, these are constructive reviews and well explained personal oppinion and I respect them.  NOTE ON POSOTIVE REVIEWS The positive reviews on No Man's Sky are lacking and I am making an inference based on the key points I have discussed that this is a product of 'The bystander effect' (look it up). Of course by saying this I am making the assumption that Hello Games is a victim in this and I know that will spark a rather large proportion of controvecy so please think of it as, this: Everyone is attacking the development team and no one wants to help by giving an alternate view, in fear of being attacked themselves. Yet again, I erge you to make your own oppinions.  TLDR The game itself is fantastic, I love it and will continue to play it, I have outlined a lot of the reasons as to why the game is seen as such a negative thing. The game has a few immersion breaking features but can be overlooked, as an exploration game its brilliant, as a survival/FPS, it lacks.  Overall I will recommend No Man's Sky not only to people that are new to it but also those that have purchased it before the update, give it another go and please make your own oppinion of the game, don't fall into 'groupthink'  P.S I value all others oppinions and I am open to constructive criticism of my review. Respect people and people respect you.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"The game was boring and repetative, everyone ♥♥♥♥ on it and got refunds, press tore the devs a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But then instead of cutting and running they decided to overcome their bad situation and kept developing the game.   The result is the first of many updates; The Foundations Update. This update adds sooo much to the game,  -New resources -New modules -A base building system -The ability to purchase a freighter and upgrade it -Several bug fixes, and more  Well done guys, and thank you for not abandoning us.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"I think the game was rushed for its initial scheduled release, and you could tell this a mile off. Basically, the devs simply didn't have the time to include a lot of the features that they wanted to at that time. A lot of people saw it as some kind of money grab, but I think it was due to time constraints, more than anything. You also have to remember that this is a hugely ambitious game.  The added features from the Foundation update have made the game a lot more enjoyable though. Survival mode in particular has addressed what was previously my main criticism of the game, in that it simply wasn't challenging enough. Also, planets have now been improved considerably, which is another big plus point.   Hopefully, the devs now have the time to work on more exciting additional features that will make this game into the space exploration game many of us want it to be. The Foundation update has certainly given us hope in that regard.   (I'll probably come back to write a more detailed review at a later stage.)",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"This new update brings a major improvement to No Man's Sky overall. The main problem with No Man's Sky in the beginning was the lack of content promised. This update is the foundation of fulfilling those broken promises. This update includes an all new Base Building system, which includes the ability to build bases both on planets and inside of all new Space Freighters which are purchasable with in-game currency. There has also been a graphics and terrain generation improvement in this update.  Some things which still need fixing: My frame-rate still lies at around 40fps even though my PC is a beast. Some graphical things such as the Terrain Generation Grid showing on distance mountains, and some textures in the new Freighters near the Freighter doors are glitching out.  Overall this update is a great step in the right direction!",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"I believe a bad approach to advertisment is what lead No Man's Sky to it's savage let down. Instead of saying 'this is how the game is now.' It should have been released as an early access game, (i.e. Alpha, or Beta) and Hello Games should have told us the true state of the game and 'here's what we are going to be working really hard to achieve in the coming months.' If that were the way No Man's Sky were marketed, then I blieve everything would have been just fine. The game is great if you accept it for what it is. Laid back exploration and a sense of how small we are compared to this Universe we are a part of. ---- The 1.1 Foundation update is a great addition to the game in my opinion! You have to give props to a small team of 8 people that they didn't just give up after the massive uproar of the gaming community against them! They really buckled down and put forth a lot of effort to prove to us that they are in this for the long haul and will stick with us and their game. You can really tell in the update that there is a lot more in store for No Man's Sky and that is really exciting! --  All in all I would say, if you are curious about No Man's Sky - wait for a steam sale, or family share it with a friend. Give it a shot. It REALLY is worth a chance!",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I was hooked on No Man's Sky from the first few minutes I played. I followed it pretty closely for about a year leading up to it finally being released. I was intrigued by the idea of free exploration on a grand scale and I wasn't disappointed. Some people don't think there's anything to do (Pre-Foundation update) but I've always felt the exploration itself and the freedom it provides was where all the enjoyment comes from. I just love exploring all the nooks and crannies of each planet I land on and generally spend 6-8 hours per planet before the inclination hits me to move on and see what the next planet has in store. The Foundation update has provided more terrain complexity, more animal ai and interaction, better vegetation, etc along with basebuilding (with farming and quests), better space battles and huge freighters to buy. I'm more an explorer so I'm just enjoying the even better scenery and ability to do what I went, when I want and where I want on 18 quintillion planets! After 230 plus hours, I just continue to enjoy it more and more!!!",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I completely understand why this game has a largely negative review score: it's most definitely not the game that many were expecting. Even so, I would still highly reccommend this game to anyone. When the game came out, it was a slow grind-fest of resource collection and practically baren planets. Many of the features Hello Games had said would be in the game were absent; what was given was pretty much an Early Access game for full price. Thus far this sounds really negative but hear me out. Many people that played the game had the sole intent of getting to the fabled 'center of the galaxy' as quickly as they possibly could and realised that the game is actually not as long/rewarding/intersting as they had hoped. I will tell you right now: DON'T RUSH THROUGH THIS GAME. If anything, don't even journey towards the center. Take your time. Get to know a single star system for a large amount of time and you'll see what Hello Games was going for: a sprawling universe with almost endless posibilities. Personally, I found the game most rewarding when screenshot hunting. The game, although not graphically the most beautiful game (compared to something like The Witcher 3 or Battlefield 1), it has an almost breathtaking art design that, when captured at the right moment can make any sci-fi lover squeal. Adding on to that, as of today (11/27/2016), update 1.1, a.k.a the Foundation Update, has been released. The Foundation Update brings an extremely comprehensive refresh to the entire No Man's Sky, making the game feel almost completely different. In short, base building is finally introduced; a new, harsher survival mode is also available; many tweaks have been made to the game overall to make the experience much more enticing. That's the beauty of this 'Early Access' structure this game has. As Polygon said, 'No Man's Sky is the new Destiny,' in the sense that Destiny, when released, was lacking in fulfilling package of content. However, look at the state of Destiny now: many still play the game and expansions have kept Destiny thriving years after it's initial release. The same is likely to happen with No Man's Sky. With the Foundation Update, this is the start of larger things to come.  Also, in defense of Hellow Games, they are quite literally a fifteen person team: many AAA games are developed with teams spanning up to 500 people. The fact that No Man's Sky is playable in any state right now is quite amazing. In other words, let this small team work their magic: the game is still evolving to become their vision.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"The foundation update has made this absolutely worth another shot. Survival mode is a lot of fun. I have faith that devs will continue to update, making this more amazing.  Recommended.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"New Update improves so much, I love it.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I greatly appreciate that in the face of adveristy and much negativity that they're still continuing to work on, and improve the game. That shows that this wasn't just some cash grab, the team genuinely believe in what they're doing. I always enjoyed the game, though it still may not be for everyone. But I'm definitely impressed.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"While the inital offering of No Man's Sky was underwhelming, and stunk of the megahype that was once Spore, the changes that have come, unlike with Spore, have really brought a lot to the game that was missing. Not only had they added some much requested big features, they've added new elements and new crafting requirements and improvement to the depth of game play. I'm much happeir with it now and think it deserves a second look.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"Ok so i dont do many reviews so just stay with me here :)  We all know what NMS is and what it didnt turn out to be. i didnt buy NMS for full price and nor would i buy it for that price.  I got it on sale and i reccomend if youre looking at getting this game now is the time   the reason i didnt buy NMS when it first came out was i thought it was too hyped and a hell of a lot was promised and i was lucky with that decision NMS fell harder than the comet that wiped out the dinosaurs it got awful reviews i watched gameplay after gameplay not believing my eyes at what i was seeing.  so skip to 3 days ago when i brought the game (hence the low hours but still not too bad for 3 days when i have other commitments.  the reason i decided to buy it was reading the newest reviews and hearing about the foundation patch. so it started to interest me now we can build we can have frieghters, have farmers and armourers live with you on your planet base  (side note - they move with you when you set up a new base on a new planet after you install their terminals) you dont know how happy i was about that i was like please dont let me have to travel all the way back there haha. and theyve added a bunch of other new stuff go read patch notes.  gameplay is good its a slow grindy game and to be honest i like that. i like games where i can go out do what i please and dont have to follow a storyline or stuff like that.  graphics are great i love how i can go from one planet to the other and its different maybe not massively like a toxic planet on one system is roughly going to be the same on the next but if you take your time like i do then youll notice all the little differences that the generator has made,  iv seen quite a few planets now water world, toxic wastelands, fiery messes, hell the planet iv set up shop on for now iv called it womans emotions as it can go from -13 degress to 100 degress LITERALLY every 5 minutes with a storm but the reason iv set up on this planet for now is because its covered in mountains of gold so making a fair few bucks there thats unless the space pirates scan my cargo get wide eyed and screw my ♥♥♥ up haha.  iv had no problems with crashes or freezing iv had fps drops but nothing that would cause me any dramas. the thing you really will struggle with is inventory you ask anyone who plays and likes NMS what really makes them pull their hair out its inventory because your kit upgrades go into the same slots as items so youre constanly moving stuff around etc etc etc.  its a chill game you go on you fly around you go to another sytem check out whats there maybe even go through a black hole and be shot 13 lightyears away like i did. you harvest you sell you get stuck ona planet because your thrusters are empty again because you didnt bring resources just in case ;)  if slow grindy gameplay that you dont have to follow the storyline isnt your cup of tea stay away far far away from this.  but if you want a game to chill to get it have fun with it and find out for yourself thats the reason youre on here to see what others think.  in my opinion a lot of the people who have given negative reviews either need to change and tweak them or reinstall it and check out what this new patch has done for the game. and NMS are working on more things but we did wait 3 months for the foundation patch but some games you wait even longer cough dragon:thegame cough cough.  yea but if youre seriously interested give it a go try going on creative so youre not grinding for the res like me and you can just mess around and see if it is for you :)  out of 10.... hmm id say...  7/10 for now its a lot better than what it was it has everything i like and it is a good game hello games just shot themselves in the foot at the start but theyre slowly making up for it.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"Those of you who refunded the game, i doubt you're gonna come back to this, as i feel this update really isn't enough to do that. However, for us lot who held onto the game for various reasons (whether you couldn't refund it or just ignored it) I recommend you give it a go. Hello Games has done a good job with this update, adding the huge capital ship sized freighters (which you can build inside and summon at will), base building on planets (with pretty standard building pieces and decorations, but look nice in its artstyle all the same) more resources to collect (for example, killing animals no longer collects carbon, but mordite) and some general fixes and graphical upgrades like motion blur and temporal aliasing.  The new update also added new gamemodes, such as creative, survival and the normal game mode similar to before the Foundation update. The survival mode makes the game so much harder, as life support runs out much faster, and resources are more scarce than before. Creative mode makes you a god, completely invincible and with unlimited resources and money, allowing you to just explore and build wherever you want without having to worry about running out of resources or units.  Bearing in mind Hello Games said this update was the first of many to come, I'd say it was a pretty good start, and if all the updates are to this standard then this game will be awesome within 2-3 more updates. Personally i wish Hello Games would add multiplayer as a priority, so we can finally 'find each other within the galaxy' as this would only make the game far better than it already is.  Overall: Still not entirely the game that Sean Murray promised, but it's on the way there, and it's nice to see Hello Games didn't take the money and run.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I played this game for 24.4 hours prior to 1.1 release, because like many others, I thought the game would actually provide me with something. The game was fun for the first 10 hours, and then that was it.  Now, with the Foundation update, I've played for 52.7 hours in the last 3 days. And I'm still finding new things. They actually more than doubled the amount of different resources, scattered them in many different kinds of planets and star systems, and actually prompted you to go out and explore.  The beacons are amazing in that you can actually revisit the place you've been, and home base is fantastic feeling like you actually belong in the universe.  tl;dr: 1.1 update saved the game.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,I have a lot of respect for this team for not just packing up and running with whatever cash they've made. To put out a large update with all the negative energy thrown their way shows intengrity.   I'm not here to change minds if you've made your decision about this game. I doubt it's even possible. I'd had my fill prior to this update as well. I had some fun but my efforts felt futile and aimless. The addition of being able to make a homestead and / or purchase a freighter has (for me) given the game instantly more structure. I feel as if I belong in the universe now rather than just hopping around for no apparent reason. Exploration has an immediate purpose and reward.  I'm no longer focused on just finding the center of the universe.   It feels like a game world now (not just a artsy proof of concept) which I feel is a huge step in the right direction. If they continue to flesh out these buidling systems and were to add more survival elements we'd be looking at a universe scale survival game with limitless exploration.   I'm impressed. It's still not for everyone but it's changed my opinion about both the game and the team behind it.   EDIT: spelling errors,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"It's still not the game promised, but it's most certainly a big step in the right direction.  But, even while you can build bases, customize freighters, etc., you're still just exploring planets that look all too similar, searching for whatever. However, I'm enjoying base building so much that I'm recommending it. I can't wait for future updates.  So, should you get it? I recommend you wait for at least one more major update, then wait a week after that, watch some videos on the update, then decide. This game is more like a seemingly pointless exploration game, which is strange for me to describe because I constantly come back to it, looking foward to doing...I don't know, but whatever it is, I'm enjoying it. And if HG adds some sort of co-op (better than full on multiplayer in my opinion), then I'd be sold and it would have two thumbs up from me.  I know this sounds like a mixed review, and it most certainly is, but I'm about 60% yes and 15% no and 25% wait for more updates.  TL;DR Good game, game seems about $35 or so, wait until it's worth what you think should be $60, then get it.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"1.1 Update really added a new layer to the game. It looks and feels better, with some cool features. Hopefully the updates keep coming.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,The refund button works well.,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"Dont know how it was like prepatch, but as a newcommer the game is really fun to explore and progress your ship/tools. Playing normal mode, I never see the necessity to grind or rush the game. (Of course for those who want more challenge, they have added a survival mode, although I havent tried it yet, other reviews of the update say it has given the game a nice urgent feeling, restarts are required if you land in a impossible planet though). Sorta feels like all the negativity was overblown, if that was cause of the update then awesome. If this was the foundation, the future updates will keep improving the game.   To be honest, 35$ is the appropriate price for the game right now. It should have never been released at 60, nor be given the nod by devs that it should be treated as a 100% finished game. Although at the time of this review, my play time is still a little minor, the nichness of the game is really apparent. I do love this kind of gameplay loop, so it will keep me going for a while especially with what the update added/changed. Like with any game, charging right through its content will probably leave a more negative experience as well.   EDIT: To clarify, this is not an indictment to those who felt slighted by the developers. I am saying, the update to me as a newcomer to the game and someone who relatively ignored the hype/response to the game. It feels like it had been really blown out there, so thats a positive if the patch (and future updates) gave me this different perception of the game. With the continued stream of updates, this will become stronger in time. So that should be a positive thing, if everyones activism had them change their entire ideology after release.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"THere is so much hate for this game and I can see why. 60$ for an Alpha? WTH!? But honestly this game isn't as bad as many make it out to be. You'll read more and more negative comments but most of these people don't even understand the game. To start this game is MASSIVE. THey didn't randomly generate a game world, a solar system, a galaxy. No, they randomly generated a freaking UNIVERSE. 225 galaxies to explore. 18 quintillion planets to land on, seamlessly, with 0 loading screens (unless you're jumping from one star system to the next but even then load times are 1-5 second) All of this packed into a 2gb package!? That alone makes this game impressive AF. But lets get down to the meat and bones, the gameplay. It consists of mostly walking, scanning alien life, objects, flora. SHooting rocks, gathering materials. The basics. Just like every other survival game. But now with the new update they've really shown what this game is capable of. Now you can claim a planet for yourself, build a base on it, hire alien specialist to gain more technologies, blueprints, etc. You can farm rare plants to gain important material. Purchase a GARGANTUAN freighter and load it up with materials to then fly to other systems and sell for MAJOR profits. Wanna customize that freighter? well you can. you can build inside of it just as if it were a planet side base and fill it with whatever. Honestly this game is flawed. It isn't great, but it is good. THis update is the first step the team of 15 at Hello Games (yes 15 people made this game) in the right direction. If you deleted this, or werent able to get a refund and just pushed it from your mind. Now would be the time to get back into it. The next update (Codenamed Biggie) is right around the corner and the content in this current one is worth the time, I promise. They rebalanced everything and added a load of content. Give No Man's SKy a second chance. you wont regret it.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,Is this game perfect? No... But update 1.1 proves that Hello Games is working very hard on this. I see a lot of future in this game.,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"When NMS first came out I played for about 30 hours, like most people's experience the first dozen hours were the most fun, fixing up your ship, discovering a new planet, starting the atlas path etc. it was hugely disappointing when it turned out there wasn't anything at the centre (I never got there, but read about it), and finishing the atlas path didn't really seem worth it, however I still enjoyed most of my time with the game, so I put it down and waited.   HG had talked about free dlc and it definately felt like they had been a little rushed to get the game out.  There was stuff that I thought would be in the game that wasn't (quite a lot), but I am pretty used to that by now, so many games have had reveal trailers that make them seem to be something other than the final game you end up playing. Still I had confidence in HG adding those things in over time.  The silence was a bit annoying but I think a lot of people vastly overeacted. For such a small team the reception and hounding from certain communities online must have been crushing, they poured heart and soul into this game, even lacking much that was hinted at, it is quite unique and I think there only option was keep quiet and work hard to deliver updates that realised it's potential, the last thing they needed was to make promises they may not be able to keep.  The game suffered because of monumental hype and it obviously was too much for some people when it didn't fully deliver ever single thing they expected.  The Foundation update has made me love this game again. I started a survival mode game and it's so much more rewarding than the normal mode, even though I must have died about 12 times so far.   It forces you to plan ahead, I won't go to a new planet without enough plutonium to take off again (often hanging around in the station hanger bay buying small amounts off each ship that comes in).   I also make sure I had enough power to recharge my exosuit systems incase I end up in an extreme enviroment.   That said, I have still had at least three occasons where I have been pretty much resigned to my fate, seeing no way out other than starting a new game; stuck on an extreme planet with no way to recharge my suit and only small pockets of plutonium at distances too far to gather and return.   Somehow I have always eventually found a way to continue, even if that required gathering tiny amounts of plutonium, with just enough time to transfer to my ship before death, rinse and repeat, enough to get back to a station and stock up again.  I have now built my frst base and am doing missions for the staff I have hired. The update seems to have massively improved the diversity of planet generation, my home planet has vast deep gorges, sprawling cave networks and is a joy to explore.  I have seen planet's with huge mountains far bigger than anything I saw previously, and resource and flora placement gives the impression of different planet biome's as you explore. A lot is familiar but it always seems an improvement on how it was previously generated.  I am really looking forward to what the next updates bring, and hope HG can regain trust in those people that are cleary currently unable to forgive the past mistakes.",1,0

I wouldn't buy this game at full price however, as it dosen't yet have enough content, but if it's on sale, definity pick it up and try it.  Update: So, I've found a frieghter, I like them so far..  Using your 'X' menu you can warp it to you from any system,   but you cannot warp your frieghter to a new position in the same system.  Just discovered you can! But you cannot manualy fly your freighter, which would be     awsome!    ",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"This upvote is conditional. If you see the game on sale for $20-30 then grab it. $60 is asking way too much, as the game feels less complete than several of the Early Access games I have in my Steam library. I do not recommend the game at the $59.99 price point at the time of this review. I do not think you will be disappointed in the game if you get it for $20 if an open space exploration game sounds like fun to you.  The game is really relaxing. There's really not much of a challenge unless you're playing on Survival Mode. It is repetitive but visually pleasing. Therapeutic in a sense.  Animals and planets are now more diverse since the Foundation update, and base building gives you a reason to revisit some planets, whereas before there was no reason to travel backwards on your journey to the center. Let me take the chance to once again state that the game is very repetitive. This is not a bad thing if you want a game that will give you predictable expectations. I find it a great game in 20-30 minute sessions a few times a week.  Your mileage may vary.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"NMS has gotten a bad rap. I'll be honest - It has its good and bad points. Overall, though, the bad rap it has gotten was due to eitherstuff that didn't make it into release -YET- or stuff that people talked themselves into expecting that was never explicitly stated.  If you are looking for a game where you get to explore to your heart's content, this is for you.  If you are looking for a game where you travel through the stars and deal with frustration from lacking, though expandable inventory, while trying to find the cool stuff, this is for you.  If you are looking for something where you can group up with other people, have massive trading (or weaponized) wars, this game is not for you... At least not yet... Though possibly not ever.  I came to this game expecting relaxing, if challenging, exploration. I got what I expected. I am happy with it and I am glad to see that it is still expanding. ",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"I bought this game because I like exploration game, without any hype or expectation like most people had. I was okay and cool with the initial release and was lucky that I've never had any crash like other user reported.  The gameplay itself was okay, the game managed to keep me busy with exploring and discovering new creatures, techs, multitools and ships.. for first several hours.  After a while, I suddenly already had discovered all the multitools and ships tech, and it was only matter of time to discover the materials to build them.. Discovering techs suddenly became boring. Multitools and ships came in different shape.. but with no different feature. Pistol-like or rifle-like, I couldn't feel any difference, what matters only the installed techs. Same goes for the ship, whether is big or small, it was really doesn't matter. The shape purely is for cosmetics, and I was not satisfied with this mechanics.  What keeps me up to play NMS, was purely because I like to explore, and the gameplay itself wasn't that bad. And now with the recent update, NMS was getting better.

275850,No Man's Sky,"After the 1.1 update finally, i can recommend this game  I was enjoying the previous version but i knew the market that suits the game is very niche. With the latest update somehow it broadens the market and more people can enjoy this game  The engine is solid, the future was lost but now it resurface with the new update  You might want to wait for cheaper price but current discount price at 40%off is a good starting point",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I'm going to review the game in its current state (after the Foundation Update) and say that the game is now (mostly) worth its pricetag. I paid 60 on launch day expecting the very features that the Foundation Update brings and I am very pleased they are now present. For example, I bought Minecraft in the beta stages, and have been happy with their updates ever since. I would look at the Foundation update as version 1.0 in the same way.  Pros: The game will provide you the experience you're looking for -You can milk the game and stay entertained for countless hours, very much like Minecraft. -You can rush through it (Iyou don't rush movies; why rush this?) if you so choose. -Base building is amazing, though slightly buggy (sentinels occasionally found indoors) -Updates are promised on the horizon, which will make the game a great investment.  Cons: Still buggy as hell. -The game occasionally crashes to desktop, so you must save often. -Framerate will occasionally drop horrifically which is fixed with a game restart. -Still no meaningful multiplayer capabilities (from what I can tell)",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"Worth original Price Tag - NO However, the update has put the wheels back on this wagon, its now well worth the buy at the going rate of £23 with guaranteed free updates in the pipeline. Some are going to wait for further Updates until the Game Content reaches a level that suits their needs but who's to say whether (or when) this Price Tag does not rise to previous Point of Sale? at which point some are going to regret not grabbing it right now. If future Updates are anything like what we just got in in the 1.1 Update then this Game is stepping out of the shadows and back into the positive light of pre-launch expectations in my opinion, and ought to be recognized for the innovation it undoubtedly is, irrespective of post-launch shortcomings. Many are already returning and are suitably impressed with the new content as it stands - me too.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I was hoilding off on the review I wanted it to be positive because I have enjoyed the game thus far, now with the update it's starting to shape up to what it was advertised as. although in saying that I would like more instructions on how to build a base etc but hey the game is coming along I got use to every star system having like 3 frigates in them after the update it is like the universe is alive and that you're not the only living thing in the universe I hope to see more improvements and at the least local co op play as I have had many friends say to me that they would have bought the original version of the game if it was co op, now with the added base building etc it would be super cool. anyways thats about it for now everything is looking super good for No Man's Sky and I am glad I was patient with the devs. also it was a good idea to drop the price so kudos.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"Okay, this game is far from perfect.   But it's really an incredible experience. It's beautiful, surprising, survival mode is very difficult, and it was made by a VERY small team.   With all that in mind, this game is definitely worth a try (while it is on sale).",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I've never been a hater of this game, but I totally understand that it under delivered in spectacular fashion! This update feels much more like the proper release.

Now THAT'S very interesting...",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I purchased this game on a Steam sale for ~$35.  I've had a lot of fun playing No Man's Sky, but I had low expectations going in and did not play prior to the Foundations update. There's not a ton of depth with what is presently available; the game is predominantly about exploring a procedurally generated universe and scavenging the necessary resources to do so. I find it a relaxing exercise in wandering and poking my nose around in new locations.  To characterize the game overall I'd describe it as broad, but shallow. There's a lot of planets to explore, but they have a relatively small number of themes to draw from. There's crafting systems with discoverable recipes for many gameplay mechanics, but the recipes for any individual mechanic have 4 or 5 elements. Xenobiology produces some interesting looking races, but they generally fall into one of three or four distinct types. More depth in each of these dimensions will make them feel more substantial and the universe less samey-feeling.  The idea is interesting and should be rewarding to play for people who can appreciate slower paced games and a focus on explorative gameplay.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I know that this game has caught a ton of heat for 'misleading' the consumers. But if you listened to Hello Games from the beginning, they constantly stated that the demo worlds were not what you would see. They just showed a world that was representative of everything possible on one planet. Sean Murray constantly stated for years that multiplayer would not be a thing. The fans kept pushing him until he slipped and said that it would be possible, but HIGHLY unlikely. Then the fans took it from there. When the game released, everyone was mad that they didn't get what they dreamed up, they just got what was stated all those years ago. Well, I never bought the hype, just the game. I have had a blast with it. You may not. I have found that it depends on the solar system you start with how your experience is. I started another game on PS4 and have had a pretty awful time. But you get that with procedurally generated games. It is a fun space exploration/crafting game. Nothing more, nothing less.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"I bought it for $36 after the update. It was still overpriced, but I have had an absolute blast with the game. If you are willing to spend the money, you will have fun, as long as you want to explore planets, instead of rushing through the game.  The biggest problem with this game is it is very easy to play in a manner that will not be fun. If you only follow the objectivies laid out for you, like you would in most games, you will not have fun. But if you take the time to explore planets and scann Flora and Fauna, and give them funny names, you are going to have a great time. that is what the game is all about.   Yes, there is not a tremendous amount of diversity among the planets, but there is more than enought to make the game quite fun. The only exploration game that I have played that is better than this is Subnautica, and sadly, that one isn't is space. If you want a space exploration game, this is your gig. nothing else on the market even compares.  By the way, based off the newest update, the game is only going to get better. And it is already quite fun.   inb4 &lt;60% helpul because I said I liked this game. RIP this review.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"This is certainly a game that received a lot of hype, hype that it didn't quite live up to but that doesn't mean it is a bad game. The internet can be a dangerous place but if you start No Man's Sky with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is then it's an extremely fun game. However, if you read what’s out there on internet you’ll skip purchasing No Man’s Sky every time but why not stop and think for yourself for a minute? If you want a game with space exploration, planet exploration, guns, grenades, lasers and warp drives then No Man’s Sky has it. If you’re after a game that takes your mind away from day to day life, take you into another world with an incredible atmosphere then No Man’s Sky does that. The recent foundation update has shown a glimpse of what lies ahead for No Man’s Sky. It shows there is still a small dev team willing this game success and adding features what should have been there on release. We may never know why the game was feature limited on release but I believe the future is bright for No Man’s Sky, very bright.  If you want a game with a deep complex story, boss levels and explosions the size of a small city then No Man’s sky isn’t for you but please make that decision for yourself. Pros _____ Great graphics Wow! moments Wide variety of plants, animals and minerals Base building and research Various game modes Buy any ship with a wide variety Buy a huge freighter that you can summons Challenging moments  Cons ____ Can start to feel a bit ‘samey’ after 20+ hours Doesn’t (yet) include the features that were discussed during development Story mode is pointless and doesn’t emotionally involve you at all to keep you going Some animals are just odd… ",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"Well this is a risky review, but all I can do is give an honest opinion on my experience.  Let's start with this game is not something you have seen before, don't try to fit it in with minecraft or elite dangerous, don't compare it to FO4 or COD, it's not like anything you've ever played before. It's a true work of art that masquerades as a game, look at the science involved in the generation, real world science.  I'll start with cost as that's a beast, Hello Game is a British company, if you have any idea of what's going on in the world I imagine you know what Brexit is and how it's raised the cost of everything in my Country, this is a £25 game pre-Brexit, sorry about my fellow idiots, they did mess everything up for me as well.  I've been waiting for something to stratch the exploration itch, when this was released it was also mentioned that there would be base building, for me that's what I was looking for, a galaxy to explore and being able to call somewhere home. When the Foundation Update dropped and I saw what it included, that was all I needed to try the game out. I'm not even close to being finished with it, but I think that I've put in enough time to now have an opinion.  It's a space exploration game, yes it's a bit grindy, yes it's beautiful, there's quests, upgrades, ships, tools, space freighters, pirates and aliens. Every planet is very different, even when they initially look the same, the detail in the generation is incredible and unfortunately appears to be overlooked by most, I've discovered hundreds of stars, planets, plants and animals in my travels through space, I'm busy learning three alien languages to allow me to understand the races I meet. There's moral puzzles, maths puzzles, language puzzles and puzzles based around the races lore.  An example, I found a monolith on a planet, when I interacted with it, it began to melt and I could see a creature frozen in the ice, the monolith gave me two options, I could leave the creature trapped or try to free it, I chose to free it, wrong choice, I was actually distubing a sacred tomb and it lowered my standing with the race faction. It's a one off choice, there is no changing your mind or having another go.  I actually love that I made the wrong decision for the right reasons and was punished for it, it's just not something you see in games, the entire galaxy is full of little events like this, where choices on a human level are just wrong. As I explore further I keep finding little snippets of lore that teach me about the races, their culture and history, which in turn enables me to actually start to figure out the moral choice of the race rather than my own.  All through this I'm on a mission to gather as much knowledge about the galaxy as I can, this in turn gives me access to better everything, but best of all it happens naturally just by exploring.  Yes, there's space battles, land battles, creature fights, the sentinels (space police), looting freighters, environments that'll kill you, but even on the harshest planets, devoid of life, there's beauty to be seen, exploration to be had, and knowledge to learn.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I'll keep it short and simple Pros: -Literally Everything, No Man's Sky fulfills everything I want in a space game, I truly love it.  Cons: -No Multiplayer -Some may feel that its a bit repetitive although after the new Foundation Update 1.1 I do not get that feeling like I used to. -SPOILER   Disappointing end to the Atlas Quest in my opinion, that is. While you get to find blackholes in the galactic map, it just feels like I wasted 10 Atlas Stones,the reason is, you don't get to name the new 'star' you built or even find it also the reason I put quotations on star is that there is no way to really know if one has been built or the game just says that.    Give the game a chance, it really is amazing and deserves some love.  Just..One..More..Atlas Stone AAAAnd its morning.",1,0

I did take a break as it did get repetitive, but after the foundation update (and seeing as HG is updating as promised!) I can really recommend this game.

275850,No Man's Sky,"I was gifted a copy of the game by a friend (JF) before the game release, and I wasn't too pleased with what we got, and I seriously was thinking on doing a review condemning the developer, and the game.   Now however, with the release of the new foundation update, and after playing the game for a few more hours I can honestly say the game is worth the sale price (as of now it's still on sale - Nov 30th 2016), and they have done allot of work getting this new, and improved update out.   Sure they still have a long way to go to make up for what I consider the fault of Sony, and starting with this update only shows that they are going to give us what they promised (even though the trailers showed material not in the game at release time... again the fault of Sony).   Do I recommend the game now?  Yes I do, so snap it up while you can. In the long run you will most likely be happy that you did.  Note: Disregard the naysayers out there, they just can't admit too themselves that HG is here to stay, and are heading in the right direction. They want the game too fail miserably so they can slap themselves on the back.  So, jump in folks, and have fun with the game. ALSO note that the game is still in development meaning there is not only some great additions coming to the game, but there will also be bugs that will need to be dealt with so stay tough, and enjoy the ride.... It will be worth it in the end.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"I held off buying this because of the hysteria surrounding it but with the recent update and price drop I thought I'd give it a go. I know it's not what a lot of people were expecting and there definitely are discussions to be had around the way games are presented pre-release, but I personally am having a great time with this. The game has its flaws but if you think it sounds like something you would be into then you shouldn't be put off by the negative reviews.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"At first this game was horrible. After 1.1 it's good, but far from what it could be. Now there's actually things to do and you don't get bored after 2hours like before. I never thought I would say this but, good job Hello games. Keep your updates coming and your game could actually become something really good. For starters I you could add the ability to have several bases. Another thing bovering me is all the long 'cutscenes everytime I interact with an alien or a terminal, trim it down for christ sake! What I would recomend you do Hello Games is LISTEN to your players and actually furfill your part and put the things gamers want in your game!",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"Foundation Update: Simply put, 3 months are literally not enough to develop, implement, test and release an update of this magnitude, no matter how big your studio is. Anyone who has ever coded can understand this. This strengthens my suspicions that NMS 1.0 wasn't the game they planned to make in the first place, and they got pushed by Sony to an early release with everything that followed being a natural result. I believe many of these features were under development already when the game first launched. Even now, after 1.1, people still find more data files like the ground vehicles and the fourth alien race. After the tinfoil wars, HG have come out of their closet and the answer is good: These are good programmers and they love their game. For me this is good enough.  As for the content of the update: Survival Mode is probably the best thing that ever happened to the game. This is seriously difficult. The freighters and base building are a nice way to add more playtime and giving a way to build a full economy. Maybe for the Creative mode players it's all about the screenshots, but at Survival having a steady, safe income from your farm is VERY important. Other game changes like making buildings scarcer, auto miners, beacons and craftable save points help a lot with both immersion and cartography of an endless galaxy. Planets are now more diverse than ever, with varying biomes per regions. Mountains and valleys are way more distinct, unrealistic animal anatomies have been very toned down, animal population, size and behaviour is much better. Space battles are much better now, skies are more populated and new interesting features like Bounties are the icing on a very well baked cake. Overall, every single change in this update has been very good. Granted the initial ground was on the low side as they basic game was very blunt. This is no longer the case though. The game is now lifted in a very good standard, and if HG continue working with the same passion we will see an amazing game pretty soon. As I was writing since the initial release, the immense potential is still in the game.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"I don't usually review games unless I feel like there's a large distance between my impressions and the sentiment expressed by the majority of reviews. At the time of this reivew Steam lists the overall user reviews as 'Mostly Negative.' As my experience with NMS has not been 'Mostly Negative' I wanted to offer my 2 cents.   NMS is a really cool exploration crafting game. It is a super laid back experience that you can play for hours without getting fatigued or frustrated. Between bases and the Atlas 'main quest' there's plenty to keep you on a track if you want, but you can jump off the main track and just do your own thing whenever you want. I like this sort of 'opt in' gameplay. Sometimes I want to build up my base or discover more of the game lore, and sometimes I just want to explore. NMS can be a strcutured or free form as you want, and you can switch off freely.  I don't like sandbox survival games, and I don't really like crafting in games, so I was super skeptical going into NMS; I didn't expect to enjoy it. However, after a while I got into the groove and really enjoy it. Once I started to understand what types of resources I needed and generally how to find them I started to really like it.   That said there are things I find aggrivating. Inventory space is really, really, really tight and the upgrades you craft must be equipped into inventory slots. That means that everything you equip reduces spots for materials. On top of this you have to keep a lot of basic materials on hand just for the core gameplay, such as fuel. Because of this I find that I'm rarely able to craft things. I've picked up dozens of recipies for upgrades, but in 30 hours I think I've crafted 2 upgrades. I really wish the game was more liberal in terms of the inventory space, or that equipped upgrades didn't eat up inventory space. Additionally, I wish there was some kind of resource locator or something. How do you find what you need? There's a scanner, but it doesn't work too well. There are upgrades for it, but I don't have the space to equip it and I can't find the materials to build it!  The above criticisms of the core crafting and collecting mechanic could have been enough for me to shelve the game after 10-12 hours. However, there's a lot here to keep me going. First, the base building in the Foundations upgrade holds out hope that resource space and resource availability will be easier with the base. Plus, the quests to build the base are fun and add some variety. Additionally, the exploration is just plain fun. When I get bored with a system, or if I don't like the planets in a system, I just take off to a new one. There's always new and exciting things to see. The planets varry quite a bit and no two are alike. A relaxing gameplay distraction I really love is scanning and cataloging animals and plats. When I don't feel like doing the resource grind I find a cool planet and go all National Geographic on it.  Finally, there is some really cool action. You'll get interdicted by pirates if you have valuable cargo and will have to dogfight. This was super aggrivating at first and I kep getting blown up. But after buing an upgraded ship this has gotten a lot better. Space battles are really fun. You'll also find freighters being attacked and can save them, so there's some variety in the space battles. You'll also find yourself fighting against the drones on the planets. The agressiveness of the drones varries from planet to planet, and planets with extremely valuable resources will often have very agressive drones. You'll find yourself fighting against them head on sometimes; other times you'll try to outwit and outrun them by hiding. The drones mix up the action on the planets, but they are also kind of weird fromn immersion perspective. Why are there these AI drones on EVERY planet and why do they all look and act the same? Where do they come from? Who mantains them? I have no idea. It seems pretty weird. Lastly there's the action and drama of dealing with hostile planets. Nothing will get your blood going like being out of fuel on a -230c planet during a storm!  There are definitely things I'd like to see in furture updates. A resource locator and some better balance for invetory would be nice. More quests and NPC interaction would great too. The ability to build temporary shelters on hostile planets would be helpful. Variety in the space station designs would be great too. Cities or towns on some planets would increase immersion. And a solar system map would be SUPER helpful. A more usable galaxy map would be nice too.  Overall this is a really great game. Two of my favorite games are Skyrim and Elite Dangerous. NMS feels a bit like a combination of the two. If you enjoy space games, exploration, free roaming, and a gameplay experience that can be as relaxed or as intense as you want then this is a great game.",1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"Okay to start this off I was never part of that oversized Hype train before release. I have no need to bash the developers for what ever the general populace of steam has been bashing them for.  I like the vast open world exploration of the game even though it is single player the Graphics dont have to be amazing to suite me but the price does need to change this is NOT Triple A material in my honesty opinion.  With the Foundation Update the base building is pretty darn fun once you find that perfect planet with no crazy weather conditions.  Spoiler Alert: The game will find this planet for you so dont bother looking just progress the game like normal.  The frieghters on this game are quite immpressive and VERY costly they made the currency in the game (units) acutally important now.  The three games modes are a nice killer way to choose how you want to play I bought the game solely because of the 3 game modes and base building and Survival mode is UNFORGIVING but, the rewards are so much greater in space and on any planet when you find that resource your looking for.  In survival you cannot just run around and colelct everything and not pay attention to your surroundings,protection,oxygen, and even your ships fuel you acutally have to make careful decisions on weather or not to land on this planet because you can become easily stuck on the world with no way to get off until you find a fuel source so in short it feels to me as if im am in a very realistic survivala siutation.    Some cons I do hope they look into though is the Hostile space ship fights (or frieghter fights) in survival mode as it is extemely difficult to take on more than two ships on your own without proper upgrades to your ship which can easily make your lose all that hard earned items you found/mined.  I give this game a 8/10.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"The newest update was a real gamechanger and although the base game didn't give me what I want I can't help but appreciate the absolute massive content drop that just fell onto my lap. Looks like I'll give this game one more go.  For those who don't know what 1.1 gave a few highlights are: -Basebuilding -Farming System for plants that you find -Buildable save points, mining nodes and beacons. -Questing System for Bases -Homeworlds -Fast travel to and from said homeworlds -Gigantic Friegters that you can customize from the inside -Lighting overhaul -Major Space Combat Tweaks -New Resources and new ways to gather them -3 Gamemodes (Normal/Survival/Creative)    Survival has been kicking my ♥♥♥ up and down the hills of my starting world    -New randomly generated elements like parts of ships and plants -Lovely addition to the already nice soundtrack -Bug Fixes  My goodness that's a lot and in such a short take after release and this is supposedly the smallest of the content updates to come (if you can still take Hello Games word at it).

275850,No Man's Sky,"I'm not one to review games (ever), but I believe this game deserves a little credit for what it is, and not blame for what it isn't. Let's keep it fairly succinct:  The game on release was lackluster. A large group of people believed that this was supposed to be the game to end all games, and when you drink that koolaid you'e always in line for disappointment. Yes, the developers did make comments and show clips to SUGGEST certain features that didn't appear on launch (multiplayer, amphibious ships, freighters, base building, etc), however they chose to hint at things instead of promising them outright....so that when they didn't appear in the game people felt duped, including myself to a certain extent. Without splitting hairs too far, it was a shady practice by a bunch of guys that are fairly new to the market, and I THINK they've began to learn their lesson, though time will ultimately tell.  Why do I believe they've learned their lesson? Because they didn't abandon the game though the majority of players were absolutely destroying their game, their company, and ultimately the reputation of both. Instead of making grandiose promises, they buckled down and fixed the major issues not long after launch. Instead of trying to deflect comments that they took everyones money and left, they were adding a HUGE update (one that they consider small) by adding new features to the game that make it look nicer, run smoother, and much more interesting to play and explore.  On that topic, update 1.1 is really nice! It adds freighters and base building to the game, along with tons of improvements, new resources, items, upgrades, etc. The HelloGames team calls it the first of many, but instead of making promises it seems they are opting to just deliver a welcome suprise occasionally, which I appreciate in light of how they started.  There are undoubtibly plenty of people who will still be angry and will add negative reviews even after this update. These aren't all necessarily baseless, but it's important to differentiate between people who don't enjoy the game as it stands right now, and people who feel that they got duped and will never be happy. Some people would make you think that this game was a major life purchase, like they bought a car without an engine. It's a standard priced game, divide it by the number of hours the reviewers have in it and tell me if you can do better with other forms of entertainment...if you can, don't buy it. However I think it's an interesting Space Exploration game with some really incredible randomly generated planets, animals, lifeforms, ships, etc. I love finding new planets and being blown away by the complexity and beauty. My gut (and this patch named 'Foundations') suggests to me that we're moving towards a truly multiplayer experience, how that shapes up will come with time. Regardless of where it goes, it's fun to play NOW. Is it worth full price? Maybe not....however I bought this game at full price for myself and my friends and am now happy that I did, as I look forward to seeing where it goes.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"With the 1.1 update, it is a sign of huge improvement. I enjoyed the game before, now it can only get better.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky has been a weird experience. Seen by many as a promising game, it quickly got consumed by its own hype, pushing even the developers and Sony to promise heaven. This lead to many things; From the false marketing of maybe planned but finally undelivered promises over the radio silence and bad customer treatment, up to the outrageous triple A price tag on the 'unfinished' product upon release.  But aside of that history and in light of the new Foundation Update with which Hello Games delivers on their promise of ongoing free updates to see their promised game realized one day, we should look at the game itself. Not what it could be or might be in the future, but what it has become. And by no means is it a bad game.  No Man's Sky's Vanilla mode, which is still an option in the new Foundation Update, was easy. Once you got the rough ideas of the game down, you had no problems gathering resources or surviving. It was just an exploration game with a sandbox universe far too big for its content. Quickly one saw that each planet was just a small number of variants that decided to randomly litter the overworld with monoliths to learn the language, plants and especially structures. They had no coherence or sense to them. In space you often found the same cookie-cutter setting with the same aliens and only slightly changed price tags. Sometimes you even saw the same alien three times... not by design, but by actual identity. The cloning bug. The achievements were generally easy to do, aside of the planet exploration of species or the survival achievement. The main reason was the tedious search for the last alien that spawns as a rarity or the fact you had to survive 30 Sol in ONE sitting on a dangerous planet. It was not accumulative.  The vanilla version of No Man's Sky stands as a warning. Too high expectations and the urge to be swept up in hype forced an indi studio to oversell their own game and vision and they paid a terrible PR price for it. While one can point the blame here solely on Sean Murray and Sony, one has to ask what the other developers thought. Today we see their work which not only introduces crews, building, diversity and an actual survivor mode, it also offers new variety to a previously stale game.  No Man's Sky was delayed prior to release to finish features. It was still released without them. Today we might actually see the original idea of NMS in its 1.0 juvenile version, just with the label of being 1.1. In truth this game never deserved the triple A price-tag. It might not even deserve it now. But NMS is not the villian that people have branded it recently, it is just another indi game that was overhyped.  If you see NMS at a reasonable discount or for below 30 bucks compared to its 60 at release, this game definetly deserves to be explored. And with many people coming before you, you might actually be able to trace their steps as they weathered the initial experience during the games initial downfall. Ingame stories, standing in their own right...  In light of the recent awards, I say give this 'villian' a well deserved hug. In the sea of survival and exploration games, NMS still remains a rarity to be enjoyed.",1,1

275850,No Man's Sky,"I've given this game a thumb's up recommendation, but ONLY if you read my full review and know what you are getting into.  You have to look at this as an early access survival game, similar to Subnautica, or the Forest, only this one was advertised as a finished product and sold for $60.   The Foundation Update is out, and it actually adds quite a bit of content. However, similar to some survival games still in early development, it has also changed direction. For me personally, the original release was too easy and had no goals. The promised progression in difficulty as you head toward the center of the galaxy was apparently absent, meaning there was no real incentive to grind out money and upgrade your ship.  With this update, we have a new survival mode in which the difficulty forces you to actually think about the game systems and plan your actions. Quite hard at first, but as you learn how the game works and get better is is very rewarding, and gives you a greater incentive to upgrade your various systems. Furthermore, you now have new resources and schematics, along with base building and related goals in the form of mini quests. And finally a larger end game goal of purchasing a Freighter which gives incentive to make lots of credits.  However, the game is far from perfect, and many of the original promises have not been addressed. Some may come in further patches, some may never happen - including things like multiplayer. This is all unknown, and no road map for development has been laid out. Also, if you don't like grinding and resource gathering or survival games in general, this patch doesn't change those core concepts. Even if you do like survival type games, there are others to choose from that are further along and have better communication with their player base and also are cheaper (like Subnautica).  But what those other survival games don't allow me to do is survive as a space explorer. With a challenging survival mode, game balancing changes, a home base with storage and creative options, new shortcut bar, improved visuals, I am personally having a lot of fun now and happy with the direction the game is taking.  However, if you are on the fence and still undecided, I would recommend you wait until it is on sale and maybe wait a few more months to see what other future patches bring.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"I have not played it until the Foundation update and what I am seeing is what I was expecting actually... much better than the first release critics describe -probably because of the gameplay changes on the update. There are groups ships flying through the planets, there are dinosaur-kind creatures, there is no multiplayer though, but still, it is keeping me very engaged. The gameplay feels very balanced, making you progress and earn more 'units' and better upgrades while keeping you wanting more and exploring new planets and settlements. I do think it is worth it.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"After the 1.1 patch - it went from a mildly decent game (not deserving of overwhelmingly negative reviews - probably a 5.5 /10) to a good game (8/10).   The patch optimized the game (running it in a 3 year old laptop below minimum specs - so far 0 crashes), added more variety and added something similar to questlines, given by the recruited staff in your base.  Also the game was re-balanced to be more challenging, even in normal mode. Suddenly there are no Plutonium deposits everywhere and you really feel some stress to keep managing your stocks.  A con is the UI that is still too console-y and missing the low-flight mod, that became essential in the previous version. Can't wait for future updates - but I am already impressed by the current state of the game.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"Enjoying it much more than I expected, given the bad reviews.  The base building and quests are a lot of fun.  Bought it thinking it was a sort of space-zoo sim where you could see lots of different interesting creatures, but they're the least interesting part of the game as they just look like a bunch of cartoon dinosaurs.  Could do without the interactivity-stopping letterboxing on every achievement/ milestone Fps varies from 25 - 60, which is extremely annoying but not enough to stop me from playing",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"Like so many people I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥, disappointed and wanted my money back when this game released.  I have put a lot of money into another game, Star Citizen, and I am happy with the amount I have sunk into it and intially compared to the $60 I spent on No Man's Sky... I was very angry with the loss of the $60 bucks, but now I don't feel it was a loss. Steam refused me and I am now glad they did; the thing with this game and the newest Foundation patch is I am enjoying it beyond the initial shine. Building bases is nothing new in a space/sandbox/exploration game but the way they are built and the tools involved are seamless and intuitive.  The freighter aspect is so far awesome. I don't own one yet but I have found a Gek freighter now a few times that resembles a star destroyer (Check out my page for a public screen shot of one'. The Korvax shares similarities to the Nebulon-B frigate. But these are only a few of the model types I have seen and rescued. The cost so far is just under 10 mil for around a 15 slot freighter and I will be watching for more. The new teleporter is great and easier way to get back to the base you built without frantically trying to use the warp nav system. My hope is that Hello Games doesn't stop here. They can learn a lot from another developer: Eleon Studios maker of Empyrion. They are active, vocal and most of all listen to the community.

275850,No Man's Sky,I love the game after the 1.1 patch. Survival mode makes me feel like the king of the universe when I accomplish in something. It ain't easy and it's not for people that get frustrated easily. This game is for open-minded explorers.,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,"I'm giving this a positive review because after months of this game being slammed and being one of the more hated games on Steam, instead of breaking up or moving to a new game, the devs SEEM to be actually trying to remedy their mistake.",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,This game isnt reallly as bad as most people are making out its just not worth a triple a price tag. Its quite a relaxing and fun game to play and the foundation update has added some other cool stuff aswell as the base building.  ,1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN," Positive:     The most well-optimized PC game I have ever played. On my system, this runs on maximum settings at a steady, high frame rate, and in nearly 200 hours of gameplay, never once has it stuttered, noticeably dropped in frame rate, or had a single screen tear. Also, one of the best looking games I've ever laid eyes on. Transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are seamless, and everything has a highly cinematic sheen to it.     Clean, intuitive interface and controls. Whether you're on foot, horseback, or riding in a mech, everything is fluid and precise. I don't think I've ever accidentally done something I didn't mean to in terms of character control. The stealth gameplay is very well executed and the enemy AI is generally good despite some minor hiccups.     Variety and interactivity are unmatched. You can approach any given scenario pretty much however you want. Charging in guns blazing will almost always get you killed, but that's an option. Want to steal a tank and ride it into battle? That's an option. Command your horse to defecate (“Do it!”) on the road to cause enemy vehicles to swerve out of control? That's an option. If you have, say, enemy communication satellites to destroy, you can go tactical by sneaking in at night in a stealth suit with a silenced tranquilizer pistol and planting C4 to detonate from a distance, remaining undetected. You can also choose to destroy the satellites with a rocket or grenade launcher or ride in on a mech and use its customizable on-board weapons or never even leave your helicopter, simply fly above the site and mow down enemies and the satellites using its mounted minigun. Veterans of the series will be happy to know that the cardboard box also makes a return, and now you can distract enemies by taping posters of models on the side of it or use it to slide down hilly areas for up to hundreds of feet. The game's world is a big playground, and simply wandering around in it experimenting with what you can do is supremely satisfying.     There is a section in which you develop new items by using the game's fictional currency. You will need to raise certain factions of your army to specific levels as well as go hunting for military experts and resources in the field to unlock or level up these weapons &amp; gadgets. This gives you a more customizable experience, as you choose what to unlock and when. You'll want a decent weapon in each category, but if you're more of a close quarters gunman, you can concentrate on upgrading the shotguns or SMGs first; likewise, if you prefer fighting at a distance, there are sniper &amp; assault rifles aplenty. Later in the game, you earn the option to modify each weapon for an even more personal experience.     Audio is outstanding, and you can use it to your advantage, judging the direction and proximity of enemy footsteps or vehicles, for instance. Among many other collectible items, you'll find cassette tapes littered all over the place, many of them pop songs from the '80s (including David Bowie, The Cure, and Joy Division) which give the game even more of a sense of period and setting. It's also bizarrely satisfying to hear something like A-Ha's “Take On Me” while interrogating an enemy, pushing a knife through his chest, then opening fire on a squad of child labor profiteers.    Negative:     Repetition. There are over 150 side ops, but they're almost entirely comprised of groups of missions in which you do the exact same thing (extract a hostage, destroy an artillery unit or communications outpost, clear a minefield), only in different places. Some main missions, though longer and more complex, are guilty of this too, and there are too few that truly progress the plot.     There are only two maps – Soviet-occupied Afghanistan (all desert) and civil war-torn central Africa (mostly marshlands and some forests). Neither contain enough interior settings (which is where Metal Gear Solid thrives, I feel), and while they are large, a lot of it looks the same and it won't take very long before you've explored both maps in their entirety. Mother Base repeats so many textures and designs that it isn't worth exploring beyond looking at your animal conservatory (featuring animals you've trapped in the field) or gathering various collectibles hidden around. This combined with the redundant nature of the missions adds to the sense of repetition in MGSV.     Hideo 'Hideo Kojima' Kojima. He's sort of like the George Lucas of videogames – MGS1 is one of the best games ever made and MGS3 is arguably the gem of the series (his  Empire Strikes Back , if you will), but the series' characters and overarching story are eccentric &amp; wacky at best and randomly silly &amp; stupid at worst - MGSV's possibly most of all - and there's nobody to tell him no, save Konami, and only after he cost them too much money. MGSV is rife with plot holes, including a gaping one due to budget cuts that prevented Kojima's team from finishing the final mission which would've brought closure to all the storylines left hanging and properly tied the game into the chronology of the series, leading into Metal Gear 1. Also, at the beginning and end of every mission, he reminds us that this is his game in the form of cinematic credits which accentuate his company and status. He even makes a cameo in the game as himself  again  (he did this in the exact same context in Ground Zeroes). The game may as well be called  Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V .    Neutral:     The story and particularly the ending which naturally polarized players. I thought the plot had some great moments but that they were too far and few in between. It has noticeably shorter and fewer cutscenes than previous MGS games, which, depending on the player, can be good or bad.     The RPG-esque micromanagement that comes in the form of leveling up Mother Base (“Outer Heaven” from Metal Gear and your home when you're not gallivanting around Afghanistan and Africa). As you extract more soldiers and resources from the field, you'll start to build more platforms and an army to train and deploy on off-screen missions with each soldier possessing different skills and traits. Some may find this fun and a nice distraction from the main game; others, an unnecessary, bloated annoyance. You can choose to ignore it to a certain extent, but you will need to level up specific squads in order to unlock some important upgrades.     The difficulty in some missions can be downright brutal, and it doesn't help that the checkpoint system is unforgiving. Boss fights (of which there are significantly fewer than in previous MGS titles) will start you over entirely if you die, and you can lose a lot of time in missions if you get very far but are spotted and killed. There's no manual save of any kind when you're in a mission, only checkpoints far and few in between. You need to be smart, tactical, and patient and not treat this like a typical shooter or 3rd person action game if you're going to survive, especially early on.     This has very little in common with other games in the series. 95% of it is spent in the open, it's much lighter overall on plot and dialogue, and the nature of its stealth gameplay has changed dramatically by setting it almost entirely outdoors as opposed to the corridor-style settings native to the series.    Verdict:   While it may not be the swan song the series deserves in terms of plot, The Phantom Pain is arguably the most fun MGS game with the most player freedom. While it has some glaring plot-related problems, they're overlookable considering this is one of the best stealth &amp; action/adventure games ever made. It’s also unique as stealth games go because of how the those aspects operate in an open world setting. Veterans and new players alike are in for a real treat with this; highly recommended.",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Since I now have 100%, I guess it's time to review this game.  It's damn incredible. The gameplay is pretty much flawless. In my 300+ hours of playtime I haven't found a single bug. Well, except an AI-driven truck trying to do some offroading, with hilarious results.   The AI is really smart, able to wipe you out if you aren't careful. They use teamwork and don't aim like Stormtroopers or cheaters, being nicely in the middle. The buddy system is great, and each of Snake's companions feels like it has a purpose, with D-Dog being my personal favourite. There's a buddy for every playstyle, as long as you develop the right equipment. Speaking of development, this game has a ridiculous amount of weapons and items to develop, and even after getting 100% I still have new guns and upgrades to try out (They don't count to 100%).   As for the story, it's a strange one, and it has a lot of different opinions. I do agree with the majority saying that Skull Face isn't a massively interesting villain, mainly due to the fact that he barely makes an appearance until later on.   ENDGAME SPOILERS   The final plot twist was pretty good too, as I have a nice little idea on what Kojima meant by it, but it's too long to fully explain. Basically, I thought he wanted us to be a victim of Big Boss' antagonism, rather than play as him ourselves.    As for the graphics, the game looks excellent, with the FOX Engine keeping the game running at a smooth 50-60FPS, and my PC isn't exactly the best around. The sound and music is also incredible, with the music ranging from the calming flutes of Afghanistan to the pounding, intense drums of a combat alert in Africa. The soundtrack also accompanies the mood brilliantly.  So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I almost can't fault it, and it's everything it was hyped up to be.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Call me crazy..but I think this game was made by some sexy beast named Hideo Kojima.   The story takes place after the events of Ground Zeroes, 9 years to be precise as your main character Punished 'Venom' Snake has been in a coma and is now on a hell driven odyssey to get his revenge.  So gameplay wise, you go on a series of missions accessing via iDroid in which Snake will do mainly extraction or assassination missions all which is at your expense of how you play the game, you can either go in guns blazing and get killed within seconds or you can go in and be the silent hero and sneak past guards, enemy mechs, snipers, the whole mile with a whole arsenal of weapons that you can put people to sleep with darts or destroy everyone with a RPG. The enemy AI is well improved as it will take skill to get passed.  You can also call on your allies to even distract some of the attention caused like helicopters, your animal or human companions to even help. If you are also new to the MGS series, do not worry because if you fail the missions a few times which of course I did on a few, you will get a Chicken Hat that either reduces the enemies spot target to half or even the baby chicken hat which basically makes you a ghost through the missions.  Plenty of other side op missions to do as well, you can also you can of course upgrade your weapons, tools, base in which you can control teams and send them on missions to expand your base. Being open world as well you also get vehicles to traverse around Afghanistan's rocky deserts whether it will be by horseback, D-Walker, or other means of transportation.  Tons of great characters and a great line of voice actors that really made the character as Kiefer Sutherland this time plays Snake. Controls are smoothe and responsive when you play as Snake, only problem I had was on certain vehicles like the D-Walker where on those controls I felt like a moron trying to be stealthy as I was roller skating my way while bumping into obstacles trying to reach the next mission. Nothing serious there, but sometimes the controls can get frustrating when you are spotted and trying to hide again.   Musical score is beautiful, graphics are amazing, no reason to go into detail on that.  As always you guys, would I recommend it? That is a definate yes, it's Metal Gear Solid! Go and buy it..like now!  Story is decent, classic and awesome characters, fun gameplay that will last hours on end because I have barely scratched the surface with this one as it provides so much more in game than what I could explain, I just had to throw in my opinion on this one.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"After gaming for over 20 years, first starting on a SNES controller in the early 90's, I am giving my first gaming review. It is fitting that the first review I write, is the latest of the franchise that I first fell in love with on PS1, the original 'Metal Gear Solid'.  Having played and finished all of the Metal Gear franchise, I can safely assume that I could regard myself as somewhat of a MG seasoned expert and Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF), Hideo Kojima has once again proven that he can easy bring AAA games to the field in a seemingly effortless fashion.  MGSV: The Phantom Pain is a visually pleasing and exciting adventure with a story line that sheds new light on the events of Outer Heaven and Shadow Moses. True to the franchise, stealth is a big part of the game; but not vital. The option to go guns in blazing is there for the times you just get too fed up of failing to infiltrate an enemy base and want to progress.  The combat mechanics of the game are easy to understand and adapt to, even for beginners with varying scales of difficulty. These mechanics are implemented into a very successful multiplayer mode which focuses on both team death match and objective style missions.  Campaign progression introduces multiple new systems of gameplay all the way until the final missions, and although the story is quite linear, there is a extreme level of freedom in regard to choices. Each choice has a consequence, some of which are small and more like an easter egg while others can affect events later in the game. They are not permanent though; all choices can be overturned by replaying particular missions to achieve desired effect.  The map size is incredibly large which can take a substantial amount of time to cross on foot, so there are a variety of vehicles that can be driven across the landscape. The open environment is fantastic for planning and executing missions and the amazing and picturesque graphics feed the desire for those who like to explore. Riding along on horseback, with a rocket launcher in hand shooting at Soviet T-72 tanks whilst listing to a great soundtrack of 80's hits from your Sony walkman is one of the pure gems of this game.  The story, like all Metal Gear games; is the best part of the game. From those that know the background of Naked Snake and his transformation to Big Boss will know the heartfelt detail that was put in to developing individual characters and giving them real human emotion to bring out that of the player. Favourites of the series like Revolver Ocelot and Kaz Miller make a big appearance in the games story along with some new characters like Skull Face and Quiet, which players will come to appreciate.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a master piece and deserves the respect that each of the franchise receives. It is an amazing story that will make you think about warfare and human desire for retribution. This game is one of the best for 2015 and should remain at the top for quite some time.  I give MGSV: The Phantom Pain the following ratings;  10/10 Story 10/10 Gameplay 9.5/10 Graphics 9/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Multiplayer  9.5/10 Overall  This game is well suited for those that enjoy the following franchises: Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, Hitman, Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne, and Mafia.",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"The last MGS game I played was MGS: Guns of the Patriots on PS3, that game was amazing. Having played this game &amp; not knowing much about it before hand nor did I play Ground Zero, I've got to say that this is probably the greatest stealth game made.   The game not only looks beautiful &amp; is well optimised (running at a stable 60fps @ 2560 x 1440 on a GTX 970) but is a pleasure to play. There are tons of missions and side missions for you to immerse yourself in as well as a base building mechanic which can be quite time consuming on its own.   I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a rich single player experince who is willing to invest quite a few hours into the game in order to fully experince it. In additon to the rich, story driven single player missions, there is also a multiplayer aspect to the game in which players can attack/defend their base or another players [mother] base.",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I've been following this game series for around 20 years, I've yet to been let down by a single entry, If you are on the fence because this is PC let me tell you this isn't just a port, it's amazing. I'm around 54 hours in and it's just getting more fun. The mouse and keyboard controls and responsive and precise, Now with a mouse I feel like more of a 'Boss' than ever before thanks to easy aiming, On the other hand if you arn't one for cutscenes and being sneaky. This probably isn't for you. Please try all the other games in the series if you enjoyed this one, the others are more linear but razor focused on story progression. This one is about rebuilding from scratch less about one misson, of couse kojima has told a beautiful underlying story. Deep and full of reflection.   10\10 would get tattooed on skin.",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world; action adventure stealth based game, developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. Releasing on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in September 2015. This has been touted as the final instalment in the Metal Gear series; however it is the eleventh game to come out since the franchise started. This is a prequel to the original Metal Gear Solid game that was released way back in 1987.  We all pretty much know what to expect from a Metal Gear Solid game by now, but for those that don’t; MGS is a stealth based game where you play in third person controlling Big Boss. Phantom Pain is an open world environment, which is a little different to how previous titles in the series have gone, but it is a nice change. You sneak from point to point avoiding guards, search lights and patrols whilst training to remain undetected. You are always encouraged to try and progress through the game by being as lethal as possible, so you are equipped with a tranquilizer dart from the beginning of the game. Phantom Pain also includes a base-building element, which allows you to develop weapons and items for yourself. You are able to recruit enemy soldiers to work in your base as well, which is definitely a nice touch. Phantom Pain also has a new day-night cycle added in as well, which means you can plan certain activities for different times of the day, such as infiltrating a base is easier at night due to the lack of light. It is so in depth that you are able to study the patrol paths of guards for certain times of the day, and even the shifts of the guards, giving you all that extra couple of seconds to sneak in unnoticed.   Graphically, Phantom Pain is just breath taking. Obviously I couldn’t play at 4k, but even a mere resolution of 1440p, it just looks gorgeous. The near life like look to this game is honestly one of the best looking games to ever be made. The PC version puts the console versions to shame and by a large scale as well. The crispness of all the modelling is perfect. Not to mention the stellar animation of everything and anything. I am struggling to find words to describe just how good this game is in this department. We have come to know that MGS games have pretty epic sound tracks too, and Phantom Pain is no different; being produced by a four time MGS veteran, Harry Gregson-Williams makes a return. Throughout the game you are able to find collectable cassette tapes which you can play during game play of the extracts of the soundtrack itself.   Phantom Pain is only tricky if you go in all guns-blazing. This type of game you have to plan your steps methodically and put your plan in place before you move. I did have to refer to a walkthrough at times to give me an insight on how to progress on some quests and areas but the majority of the time you can work it out for yourself with ease if you just pay attention. The game’s prologue which acts as a tutorial system does well to introduce a lot of the game’s core mechanics to any new players too.   The game has taken me just over 50 hours to complete the main story with a good portion of side missions. There are roughly 150 side missions to complete and I would highly recommend people try do as many as possible, not only does it add hours and hours of content, but the rewards you reap from them are far from useless.  Somehow the game for me was technically sound. I was at least expecting some bugs and issues given that it is a vast open world game, but I had no problems at all. I played with keyboard and mouse and was surprised at how well it controlled. Normally I play third person games with a gamepad, but I expected precision to be key, so of course the mouse makes that the perfect tool for the job.   My conclusion on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is that it is a near enough perfect game with no flaws from what I can see. I loved it from start to finish, and I really will be replaying the game at least one more time at a future date, just because it is a masterpiece of a game. People may think the retail price of £45,99 is high; whilst it is high you are going to be getting a game with potentially hundreds of hours of content and easily the best game to come out of the Metal Gear Solid series.      Tom's Score Card   1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended   6) This is a must play    If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN," About  Welcome to the world of Metal Gear, where the world history took a very weird twist already in 1950s. MGS5 takes place in 1980s, you play as Big Boss, who awakes from a coma after 9 years.  The game fits surprisingly well into the timeline, it closes the whole storyline and finally creates one, solid line of a story. The story is complete, finally. From Metal Gear Solid 3 to Metal Gear Solid 4. The gameplay is very repetitive. It almost feels like the game caught an Assassins Creed syndrome. But it's not that bad at all. It's still one of the best tactical, stealth action games I have ever played. The story is kinda missing from this one. But that was expected because Kojima was very limited towards the end of the game. Second chapter is very unfinished and contains only minority of main missions, rest of the chapters are just recycled mission from chapter 1 which is very sad.   Gameplay  Gameplay is very good, responsive and feels just right. Both on the keyboard and a controller. I play my game on the keyboard and I'm more than happy with it. Easy to control and fun to play.   Performance  This game literally runs on a cardboard box. My game was played on a 2 years old laptop with 4GB ram, i3 and GT740M. Runs more than good, which surprised me the most. This game is very well optimized.   Is it good for new MGS fans  Definitely. You are not losing much by starting with this game, if you plan to play other games. It links to the past and to the future simultaneously. You will learn bits from both timelines and you can get to other games later.  For me this game would be 8/10. Because of q spectacular gameplay, repetitivness and lack of cutscenes and story.",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"For Story Continuity, you must play Ground Zeroes first. Else you wil be confused by a few aspects of the story. Having played this from release day until a recently, I freakin' loved this game.  It delivers in every department that I expect a Metal Gear Solid game to showcase. -Action -Stealth -Crazyness -Insanity -Chaos -Laughter  In the Story Department, it plugs up all the gaps that has plagued the series. It all makes Metal Gear sense.  Gameplay, I LOVE it. Grinding was a pure pleasure. Stealthing was my main mode of playing. Hardly ever killed anyone. Fultoning is my most used item. Tranquilizer gun is my weapon of choice. Fun, fun, fun.  Is it worth US$60, as of 04/27/2016? A very close No, even I did'nt pay that much on release - paid US$40. Even with the Open World nature of the game, it almost justifies the price.  Despite the many hours I have poured into playing the game, there is only one thing I did'nt like about it: FILLER MISSIONS These happen towards the end of the missions list and are not mandatory to finish the story. But for someone who wants more Metal Gear, it got on my nerves. It re-introduces the missions you did ages before, but with some changes. I won't mention anymore.  For any person who loves Stealth games, this is the one to get. A stealth game in an (almost) open world environment, this is the business.",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"If you are looking for  the  perfect open-world game to accompany a months long existential depression, Kojima's ultimate Metal Gear entry will not disappoint. As you wander aimlessly through one of two equally dreary environments, you will have ample time to ponder your place in the universe as Snake similarly struggles to find any cohesive narrative or meaning in this digital masterpiece. Toil furiously to upgrade your weapons, bolster your defenses, and rebuild your mercenary empire. None of your staff will notice or credit you for any of it. There is no reward for your endless labors, and yet you will discover a sort of Nietzschean dignity to the struggle, and through it perhaps see reflected the pointless beauty of your own continued existence.  10/10 - Would darkly ruminate again!",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"[Contains very subtle spoilers]  My late review. You've heard the hype. You've heard the from the Hideo Kojima lovers (see my MGS:GZ review for my thoughts on him) and you've heard from the Konami haters (I couldn't care less about them either) - Now hear an impartial review from a true casual gamer.  Firstly - I love it and can't recommend it enough, but to give some insight on how it plays.... It's a desert island game. If you were stuck on an island with nothing but a PC and coconuts for eternity, this game would keep you occupied for a fair bit.  In typical MGS style the plot is completely out there, nothing really makes a lot of sense, and you don't really know why you are doing a lot of what you are doing. Without any spoilers, basically after the events of MGS:GZ you are looking for revenge but you end up unearthing a couple of other major plot lines along the way, which are really good - actually better than the main plot IMO. Its certainly entertaining, cut scene rich and more 'war symbolism' than you can shake a nuclear warhead at. The voice acting is great, the characters are interesting, if sometimes a little cringe. I found the ending quite unsatisfying - but the ending isn't 'the end' of playing. I got over it.  There is a constant air of seriousness about the plot but its mixed with plain weirdness and humour. You will have all seen the videos of sheep being fultoned into the air, hiding in a cardboard box with a hot chick on the front of it or using a water pistol to subdue a solider.... well the same game also contains the horrors of child soldiers, bombs stitched into peoples stomachs, Dr's and nurses being murdered by machineguns, patients shot in the head in whilst they sleep inches from you and a virus that has sickening effects on people depending on the language they speak. So yeah - Its got funny and at the same time it hasn't.  The choice given to the player, straight after the prologue, is huge. You embark on a journey of plot, main and side missions, which unlock as you go but you can generally chose which order to complete the few you get at a time (on some occasions you are forced into plot missions) - All this is done through the 'iDroid' which is basically a fictional 80's smartphone with a really crap interface. The iDroid interface is perhaps my -only- real problem with the game as a whole as being a loyal keyboard / mouse user, its the only part of the game you can see is still console-ified. You do end up becoming quite quick on the iDroid though.  In each mission, unless specified you can go all out action or sneaking or a bit of both. I found it plays a bit like a Splinter Cell Conviction in terms of combat and sneaking, enemies try and flank your last known position etc. Same trappings as all these 3rd person cover games you end up cover sticking to walls you don't want to or running over cover when you wanted to go behind. When the game opens up a bit more you can take a buddy on missions with you too - Choose from a dog, a horse, a robot or the half naked woman sniper, each have different pro's and depending on your play style you'll end up taking each one eventually.  The missions replay-ability is very clever. There are conflicting 'challenge tasks' in each mission which means you would have to play them a few times differently to achieve them all. Some reviewers I note don't like this idea of repetition, but I do. As well as this there are online challenges that change every now and then that give you bonuses to your online MGS:TPP profile.  I would argue there are only really 31 plot and main missions. Then there are 'extreme' or variant versions of the same missions over again - How the game deals with this is a tad annoying as it sort of leads the player to believe 'there is more' when in fact you quickly realise 'oh its the same again' - Again I don't really mind re-playing the same mission, especially if its an extreme variant such as Total Stealth but the way its presented to the player is a bit cheeky.  There are a bucketload of side missions to complete - A lot of these repeat the same tasks but given the choice of approach given to the player I forgave this, I had loads of fun completing all the side missions in all different ways.  All the missions are detailed and each has a lot of depth. Things are going on in the missions you don't notice the first time, second time or even the fifth time playing them and the game encourages you to replay the mission to discover these little details. There are situations where you can complete missions earlier because you know where the objective is before you would 'normally know' and there is even dialogue in the game that notes this.  As you play you develop better kit which again leads to replaying old missions with better kit. The development of kit is extensive; there is an immense amount of guns and gear to develop and customise, you must develop your base of operations and buddy kits too.  There is also a 'staff' game mechanic where you collect soldiers for your own personal army. Each staff member have different skills, like support, combat, medical etc. I really like this part of the game but unfortunately its let down by the crappy iDroid interface and it makes moving staff around your base very cumbersome and off putting.  To summerise the single player side; It is an epic journey, with a breadth of 'things' to complete. Not just the missions themselves but the challenges, collecting collectables like tapes, blueprints, animals, scouting out staff, developing your base and gear. You can continue to do this for a very long time too. The single player alone makes the game brilliant enough for me.  Then there is online MGS:TPP, there are two halves to online mode as I see it; There is the 'VS' mode and 'FOB' mode - I didn't think there was 'enough' to the VS multiplayer strain and I think its because as a shooter, MGS:TPP is pretty standard in terms of its shooty mechanics. There isn't anything new or groundbreaking about it, or nothing that makes it unique (other than it being MGS) - Its also a grinding unlock type system which is off putting. After playing a few rounds I realised that I might as well play go play my usual favoured shooter because I'm better at it and its better at doing it.  The FOB mode is the more interesting online mode. FOB is your Forward Operating Base which is just like your single player base but every player who plays MGS:TPP single player eventually gets one - You develop this base too. You can raid other players bases and steal resources and staff from them - How you do this is up to you but the main options seem to be by killing, stealing or infiltrating the base, depending on what you want. You start your raid from an individual platform, for instance infiltrating the medical platform should get you some good medical staff but if you wanted resources you could go to the support platform and steal a load of crates and then just evac out.  If you are discovered on another players FOB base and they're online they can join the base and defend it. This nowadays invariably never happens as the 'rush' of the game has passed and the number of online players is much lower... most bases I've come across the players have moved on and are playing something else, which makes raiding much about the resource stealing. Other players can retaliate later on your base but only if you were discovered on their FOB... if you sneak in undetected you basically get away with it.  There is plenty more I could cover, but I think that gives anyone reading a good view of what the game plays like.",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Working great! I love this game. First, I wanted to address the 'console controls' issue. It does exist, but it's not as bad as you might think:  Yes there are some control cues that don't use keyboard mouse - it says use left stick to walk and right stick to look, but you can figure that out. All other control prompts are fine and indicate correct keyboard keys, so don't panic.  Now, the actual game: MGS5:TPP offers a huge amount of freedom, customisation, replayable missions, excellent movies and storytelling, and fun gameplay. The scope of this game is really quite amazing. You can manage and upgrade a base, research hundreds of items, and collect wildlife, plants, resources, vehicles, objects and soldiers to use. Missions allow for multiple entry points, freedom of movement, and let you choose how you want to complete them.  In true Metal Gear Solid style, the plot, characters, and gameplay are excellent. This is one of the best games I've ever played. Highly recommended!",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN, One of the greatest Stealth Action games I've ever played. Here are some positives.,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"This game is awesome!! With more than 400h of gameplay I still have items to develop and the devs are still realeasing new stuff. Besides that it's all FREE!!! No ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC weapon pack or weapon skins. Even MB coins (a sort of premium in game to develop bases and items) it's FREE. I have all bases and didn't spent 1 cent. Besides story mode you have F.O.B. attack/defence where you can steal other player's resourses and personel, and Metal Gear Online with many game modes where you can choose a class and play as a team.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Zeek's Solid Review (Spoiler free) I normally don't do serious reviews, but I'll go ahead and try. This game is Kojima Productions at it's best, the second coming of my personal favorite Metal Gear Solid 2.   Pros: : Patches up retcons from the MSX games. : Multiple endings : Got rid of the horrid stealth ring system and removed camo index. :New and unique stealth gameplay. :Amazing engine :Well opitimized. The only time I lost 60 fps was when I saw electricity. :An extreme amount of content and story length. I could play this game for the rest of my life... Especially since I was able to put 30 hours into Ground Zeroes  Biggest complaint I hear about this game is the lack of cutscenes. The story is mostly told with cassette tapes, I look at this as a pro. I understand why people miss the sizable cutscenes because that's something the series is known for. Story for people who want it.      Cons: :The final mission of the game was removed and was a very important ending. :Rare but got spotted through walls a couple times. :If you are shooting a rpg and a bird flys by you, you will die. :Reused missions for act 2. Forgivable but still annoying. :Not many memorable quotes :Not many boss fights. Some 'boss fights' were underwhelming. :Microtransactions.    I'm normally against DLC and I'm definitely against supporting Konami but I'd really like to see the final mission either added to the game as a patch or more likely DLC.    Kojimas final Metal Gear and arguably one of his best.  10/10 mrrroOW",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Unfortunately, the game's unfinished. There's been a pretty decent amount of cut content from what I and others can piece together. The game has two chapters, the first one being titled 'Revenge' and the second being titled 'Race.' I'm limiting myself here by not trying to spoil anything. But let's just say, the story seems to fall apart and crumble in the latter half. Metal Gear Solid V's story is like a lost sheep trying to carve a path and find its way. In doing so, it doesn't exactly know what it's.... well... doing. I can only lead myself to believe that Kojima and Konami's conflict played a major role in the outcome of the game. If you play through this game and actually attempt to get wrapped up in the lore, you will undoubtedly feel like something's missing. Kojima wanted to hit controversial topics and taboos, but the overall direction, tone, and way the story is set up makes it seem less significant than intended. Certain things were left in as if they were going to have some significance and buildup, and while it seemed as such, they ended up having quite literally no significance at all. I really want to give an example here so I don't have to have a hard time explaining, but... you know... spoilers. Towards the end, plot points are just left in the air, but they're never actually tied up due to cut content (there's an entire mission that was supposed to wrap up a certain plot point, but that was, unsurprisingly, cut from the game.) The saddest part is that the cut content people have managed to find is probably not even all of the cut content that exists. In the end, this game could have been so much more storywise. The ambition is there, the themes are there, the plot points are there... but they're just left hanging. With that said, here's hoping Kojima has better success in the future. Wouldn't want to see his creative talent and potential go to waste. You are the man who trolled the world.  So why did I give this game a thumbs up? Well... I wish there was a sideways thumb option. If you aren't big on MGS's lore to begin with, or don't play these kinds of games for the story regardless, this is still a fantastic game. The gameplay is superb; controls are honestly as good as you can get in an open-world stealth game. From fultoning soldiers on the field and recruiting them to join your Diamond Dogs PMC to going online and raiding other peoples' Forward Operating Bases, I really am shocked at what this game has to offer in the gameplay department. There's so many different things to do, but I won't go into detail, as I've already said enough probably. Hell, I have just about 100 hours on record as of this review just because I find the gameplay always dragging me back for more. All I can say is, if you can overlook the story and play the game for what it is, this game is AMAZING. However, being a big MGS fan and getting sucked into the lore, this story left me in a bit of pain. Not just any pain. A phantom pain.  If you already beat the game, I highly suggest checking these videos out. They pretty much sum up my thoughts exactly. (Spoiler alert, of course.)

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN, Is MGS:V a perfect game?  What does it mean to be a 'perfect game'?,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"This is one of the best video games I have ever played... and the most disappointing. The gameplay is unmatched and a ton of fun, but its plot is very lacking.   If this were just another game, the plot would be highly acclaimed when being compared to most other games of the same genre; but this is a Metal Gear Solid game. The story is incomplete and does not do what it set out to accomplish. Nearly the entire storyline of V is irrelevant to the rest of the series as a whole. It explains almost nothing that it was created to explain.   In many ways it will leave a fan of the series feeling his own kind of phantom pain. Metal Gear Solid, to me, has always been half a game and half a movie; this is 90% game with very few cinematic moments compared to it's predecessors. The explanations for many events and lack of logic in the plot has never been this poorly handled before in the series. There are also blatantly stupid design choices.   One of the most beloved characteristics of the series has been mostly stripped away: cutscenes. The cutscenes that are present are very well done, but much shorter and less frequent than what a fan of the series would be expecting. Many people complained about the amount and length of cutscenes in Guns of the Patriots, but that doesn't mean that most of the story should be fed to the player through cassette tapes and radio communications. Phantom Pain truly is the best title for this game, because it feels like a large part of it was cut away; you can still feel and miss what the game should have been.  With that said, the gameplay is incredibly well done, very fun and relatively balanced. After a while, missions may become repetitive and dull, but there is almost always something else you can do to improve Diamond Dogs. FOB invasions, while fun, are VERY unbalanced and unfair to the attacker. Defending bases gives you a massively disproportionate advantage over the attacker with minimal risk to yourself. FOB invasions need to be revamped completely.  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is still very much worth the full price and is guaranteed to entertain you for many hours.",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"   Gamplay Mechanics:   The best, most varied, and most original in the series! While the game rewards steath, it can be played in an action style. There's even some RPG-esque elements to it! Really high amount of content to keep you busy for quite some time!    Performance:   Runs buttery smooth. The game is very much able to run quite well on systems that are not brand new! Haven't ran into a bug yet. Holds up to the typical Kojima-standard of quality.    Hideo is truly a master of his craft.  I know I'm not even halfway done with the game, but you can feel Kojima's mark in this game within the first few minutes of playing.    If you like stealth:   This is easily the best stealth game I've played, gameplay-wise (will probably end up being that way with story as well.    If you like MGS:   Seems to me to be the dream MGS game. If the story holds up then it surely will be as the gameplay is definitely the best out of all the others already.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I've literally never played a Metal Gear game in my life, and this is the best first impression possible.   I've fallen in love with MGSV, from the storytelling, the atmosphere, graphics, sound design, level design, and everything in between. It's everything I've ever wanted in a stealth game, and some of the more absurd elements, while they would detract from other games, Kojima manages to weave it perfectly into Metal Gear. I have every intention to see the rest of the Metal Gear series after my time with this masterpiece. 9.75/10.",1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"MGSV is an open world action-adventure stealth game by the series creator Hideo Kojima. It will most likely be the last Metal Gear game he will ever create and also maybe the last Metal Gear videogame ever.   You play as mercenary leader Punished 'Venom' Snake aka Big Boss. The story is placed after the games MGS3: Snake Eater, MGS Peacewalker, MGS: Ground Zeroes and before the original game released on MSX2 platform in 1987, Metal Gear. I don't think it's necessary to be familiar with other games in the series to enjoy Phantom Pain, but ofcourse it helps to piece the whole story together.   Gameplay:  First time ever, MGS is based in a open world setting. After the introduction/prologue mission you are thrown in the Mother Base which is the heart of your operations to come. You get to expand the base with different platforms by money and resources you get as a reward or gather yourself during missions. You can also dispatch soldiers to go on missions on their own to gain even more money and resources. These soldiers can be recruited during free roam or missions by fultoning unconscious enemy soldiers or saving prisoners of war. So guns blazing with leathal weapons might not be the best option, but it's still an option. Don't forget to interrogate the soldiers either, for locations of prisoners, blueprints and etc. You get to choose how you perform your missions and your perfomance is reviewed by a grade and a codename based on your style. You have plenty of different tools in your disposal like stun grenades, shotguns, decoys, rocket launchers, water pistol and even the classic cardboard boxes that help you to sneak unnoticed! But these items need to be researched and developed in your base first. You start missions by calling in a helicopter to pick you up from Base and then you can choose a mission from the list of main missions or side ops. Or just pick a drop off destination and go roam the world freely doing missions. This is done by using iDroid, hand-sized device Snake carries around. It's your primary tool for base management also and it works as a map. Besides the different weapons and tools you unlock, you also get aided by few followers. Most notably D-Dog, a puppy you can find and raise to be your aid and sniper called Quiet. Both of them will mark enemies for you so you can see where they are going even through walls. And you can give few simple commands to kill an enemy or make a distraction. But beware, even they might not notice every soldier. The enemy AI is one of the best I have seen, they react in realistic manner to your locations when spotted. If you can change your cover without them noticing they don't magically know where to follow you. But instead keep on firing and searching from the last known location. In firefight enemies also act intelligently, they don't just rush towards you but seek cover and call for back up.   Presentation:  Phantom Pain is running on the Fox Engine created by Hideo Kojima's own studio. It performs really good on PC and is quite remarkable in every way. Game looks really good and has great amount of detail. In cutscenes Snake is seen in the gear you have been wearing on missions, even the possible spilled blood is there. Voice acting is very well done, music composed for the game is great and you also can gather tapes of licensed 80's music from the enemy outposts. You can listen to these tapes on your iDroid. Unfortunaly most of the enviroments are just desert with guard outposts that don't seem much different. I was left hoping for more different locations and especially more missions done mostly indoors. And maybe bit more lively world than just few goats or jackals here and there.  Story:  This might be the biggest shortcoming of MGSV. Earlier entries in the series are known for their long and frequent cutscenes. There still are cutscenes ofcourse but the lenght and quantity has been greatly reduced. Though too much cutscenes is something that the series has been often criticized for. But at the same time it's been something many of the fans love. Much of the story is now told in tapes you gather by doing missions and you listen to them on your iDroid when you wish. Codec calls as we used to know them are also gone. You can't call different people for discussions anymore and there's no action halting calls coming to your way either. But the problem is just not how the story is told, it doesn't feel very impactful to the continuous story over all the games. It's still as wild and out there as it always has been. And the tone is all over the place, it's up to the player how well he/she thinks the ridiculous comedy and over the top plot mixes with some quite dark themes. I happen to like it. What I loved was the story and character of Quiet. You get to develop a bond with her, ingame as your character and even as a player (if you choose to use her on missions). I had my conclusion to Quiet's story after I had beaten the actual main story. And it gave me more satisfying ending for the game.   Overall:  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a phenomenal game. The gameplay itself is so damn fun with all the different possibilities you can approach the missions, controls feel great and are intuitive with keyboard/mouse or a controller. The lackluster story can't pull the game down. There's also an online portion to the game which I didn't try out at all, so I won't comment on that. The game has 2 chapters, the second chapter was quite dissapointing in it's mission structure. You need to play older missions again with different rule sets to make them harder or grind sideops to unlock more main story missions. I chose to do sidemissions, going to same locations over and over again was bit frustrating. But still the gameplay is just so fun and fluid it didn't bother me that much in the end. While the game is played from 3rd person perspective, shooting can be done through iron sights or scopes in first person.   It's impossible to go through every cool thing in the game in this review, there's just so much neat stuff to experience. Now go, get the game. Let the legend come back to life.   [Score: 93]",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Well, it opens with 85 minutes of cutscenes. The cutscenes are pretty **** epic. After that, you finally get to start exploring the open world of Metal Gear Solid V, and all I can say is that it's pretty amazing. You can go back and forth between the field and the mother base. You can kidnap or hire members to your R&amp;D team, Intel team and other teams (Just like previous MGS games) and there are so many things you can make and upgrade, we're talking about a lot of different equipment. Explosives, rifles, pistols, shotguns, vehicle upgrades etc.  The gameplay mechanics are some of the best I've seen in a third person action game. It's so amazingly fluid and the graphics look amazing. I am running it on high 1080p on my GTX 760, and it runs flawlessly. Constant 60fps without problems. I really don't know any cons in this game.",1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Pros:  -It's Metal Gear.  -Directed by Hideo Kojima appears everytime.  -Runs smooth as butter, just as good as Ground Zeroes.  (I'm on a laptop, 4gb, i5, GT 740M, running the game on high. Fox engine is amazing.)  -Keyboard and mouse controls are satisfying.  -2spooky8me, heavy war themes, historical references, 80's music, military acronyms, deep discussions about society and culture. (Young kids really shouldn't play this game. They won't understand a lot. Some things may give them nightmares too.)  -Still has that Metal Gear sense of humour which helps break up all the seriousness. (Look out for the posters.)  -Challenging and rewarding stealth that requires planning. (You can't always go in guns blazing.)  -Impressive weapon gameplay that really affects the outcome of how you play. (bullet drop, realistic reload with chambered ammo, custom attachments etc.)  -True freedom, free to roam and play how you want. (Although the prologue and beginning is linear.)  -Gorgeous environments. (There's several different environments, not just sand.)   -A lot of welcome surprises gameplay and story wise. (I didn't watch any spoilers.)  -PC Dev team has very fast response time and has released patches to improve the game. They really care about the game. (They fixed a major bug with Phenon II CPUs in under 5 hours!)  -Emotional and thought provoking at times. (Things like a prisoner crying because you came to save them, their speech weak because they've been tortured and beaten. It becomes harder to pull the trigger when you eaves drop on enemies and hear that they only took the job to support their children. Sneaking out of a base saving the prisoner and not killing anyone makes you feel like a true hero. When you return to your base everyone salutes you and thanks you for saving them. No other game can offer that feeling.)   Cons:  -People who didn't play Ground Zeroes may find the controls learning curve a bit steep.  -Menu doesn't have mouse support, navigate with WASD. (I don't mind but I'm guessing that will make some people mad)  -Windows 10 users may have issues. Some people have the game running fine while others not at all. Most people having trouble running the game are using Windows 10. If you are using Windows 10 maybe wait a bit longer. The devs haven't tested it out so officially it's not supported.    So I've finished the game and I can say without a doubt that this game is worth playing. People will still be playing this 5 years from now because it is so much fun. I know I will...",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.  - Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff, - Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end, - Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created, - Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory, - Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs, - Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you, - THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all, - Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery.  The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.  All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life (ive been gaming since Pong/2600). My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released. This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one. I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game.  I'm the kind of gamer where I need the big 3 from a game: Story, loot/crafting, Char devepment/customization/skilltrees. This game has it all, and its completely adjustable. Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills? Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style). You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull? Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle. 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience.  Games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore. A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it. In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me. In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect. However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized withcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades. Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils. Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet.... You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing good that they are now releasing it as a full game because everyone went ape ♥♥♥♥ nuts for it. Ive played so much Gwent that I know what the computer is going to do before they even do it. I could go on and on, but bottom line.......this game has set a new mark in all the gaming industry for other compaines to aspire to. CDPR for ♥♥♥♥ing life.  Pros: Everything, it has it all. This is the equivelent of gaming super crack - Great char building and skill trees, even better now with BaW DLC - A very well done and responsive battle system that gets even more fun and tacticle as you turn up the difficulty. The only *sword fight simulator* that is better is Dark Souls. - Tons of weapons, armor, and crafting, including all the Witcher specialized sets that change their look with each upgrade. - One of the greatest game stories ive ever seen, which may have only been topped by its own DLC in Hearts of Stone. Top notch voice acting, animation, and choice/dialog system. - ♥♥♥♥ing Gwent - A vast living, breathing open world only rivaled by GTAVs open world for scope and detail. - Details, details, details, a huge amount of love and time were poured into this game. I spend hours just looking at stuff and admiring all the little things. (see hours played)  Cons: It will ruin all other games for you. Everything else is now harder to get in to because of this.

In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).   Gameplay - 9/10   Beautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.   Characters - 10/10   Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.   Graphics - 10/10   Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.   Sounds - 10/10   Music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.   Overall - 10/10   If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. These game is masterpiece.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I've been a gamer most of my life, starting with my first Atari 2600 in the early 1980's. This is the greatest RPG I've ever played. I've used Steam for many years now, and never written a review for a game before...this game was good enough to make me feel like I should.  Looking back on it, I feel like I actually played several games. The overall storyline contained so many sub-plots that each 'chapter' felt like its own complete game. I've heard some people mention this as a negative, but I can't possibly see how. It's value...you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. If you only want 40 hours of content from a AAA title, then quit playing it after 40 hours.  As for the quests themselves, I found even the random mini-quests generated from 'undiscovered locations' to be well-executed and thoughtful, some of which would only take a few minutes to complete, but added genuine character to the gaming world, making it feel like a real place. After over 170 hours of play, I found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around Skellige checking out undiscovered locations, even though I knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches, and I already had all the gear and crowns I could ever use...I didn't want it to end. I anxiously await the next DLC expansion.  I hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well, and for the life of me I can't understand why. In close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky, and it's hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed, but that's only in a few specific places. The combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it. You can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blocking/countering if your opponent is human, dodge/attack if your opponent is a monster. Now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs, potions, decoctions, and signs, especially in conjunction with area effects and each other...there are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents. Throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with Igni is always entertaining, as is using Axii to make a guy kill his buddy. Some special attacks you can unlock, like Whirl, are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship.  Gwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention, and I really didn't know what to make of it at first. After analyzing it for a little while, and picking up some different cards with different abilities, I began to realize the genius of it, and eventually got to the point where I can honestly say I haven't had as much fun with an RPG mini-game since Triple Triad in FF8. It's just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep.  Well, there you go. My first Steam review. I enjoyed this game immensely, and unless you're a cave troll, you probably will too.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,Over 1000 hours and I still don't know how to play Gwent.,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"195 hours later, my epic journey with Geralt of Rivia comes to a close. Anything I say now would just be retreading over what everyone else has said, but regardless; this was one of the finest gaming experiences of my life. The world was meticulously crafted, the story was engaging, the characters were believable, the struggles and victories powerful, combat was enjoyable and varied.. this was magnificent. Not a perfect game, but very close to it, performance left a lot to be desired and the bug list was shocking to be perfectly honest.. exceeded - if not matched - only by the likes of Obsidian and Bethesda, and that simply should not happen in this day and age. The UI was merely passable in some instances and downright terrible in others and, sadly, the levelled-loot was made utterly worthless due to the expansive crafting system in the game. You craft, and use for the majority of the game, far better gear than you can find or buy -- and that, too, is a shame.  Still, I won't soon forget this game and indeed I fear now that the bar has been raised to such a level that it will negatively impact my enjoyment of other so-called 'open world RPGs' to come. A bitter sweet realisation, I guess, though there's nothing to do about it now except wait and hope for games to match the quality set forth by The Witcher 3. Onward to Cyberpunk, CDPR, you've got your work cut out for you.. that's for damned sure.  10/10, would snowball fight with Ciri again.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,Pros: - Fabulous graphics - Very big open world to explore - Amazing storytelling - Very good voice acting - Likeable characters - Detailed and immersive cutscenes - A lot of choices to make - Enjoyable combat - Many high quality optional side quests - DLC's actually contain a lot of extra content - Gwent  Cons: - The game ends,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Witcher 3 is not a game.   It's another life you can live in, there are sights to be viewed, jobs to be done, friends to hang out with and family to love and protect.  So, Witcher 3 is not a game, Gwent is.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This video game is a true masterpiece.  The Witcher 3 offers the best storyline I've ever seen. You can decide anything, both minor and major things. All characters in game have their own story which is really awesome. Velen is a land that suffered war and gives you that real authentic touch of how medieval land looks like just like Novigrad which is just how one middle-age city looked like. Graphics are beautiful and honestly I haven't seen a RPG like it. After that you have epic side quests with amazing lore and seriously huge map to explore. By huge I mean the biggest map for 1 higly complexed video game in history.   Then, when I entered the Skellige its like I entered another world.The authentic Irish accent made it look like whole another universe which this game truly is. During game you have several romance options and you choose a girl which you will end up with which is something seirously amazing for a video game. Not to mention all those sex scenes.  To complete main storyline alone it takes around 50 hours while ending depends on you and your choices troughout whole game.   The soundtracks in this game are literally THE BEST. They are mostly made of polish folk music but there are also some Serbian such as 'Oj Lazare' which are some of the best slavic musics. The only con in this game was that in free roam I didn't have the option to talk to the main characters but that was fixed in latest expansion which I really appreciate CDPR for, as I and many other customers requested it.   I won't be describing DLC's as this review should be dedicated to the base game. I really recommend this game to everyone, from RPG fans to those who never played a RPG game before.   You WILL enjoy this game and you must play it!  It was worth every cent, 10/10.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is more than another blockbuster title; it's one of those that defined a chapter in my life.   I played Witcher 1 when it was released in 2007, back when I was a single man working in my first job few years out of college. I even remember playing it through one of the worst years of my life. 2011 came, Witcher 2 was released and I immediately bought the box set with the soundtrack, coin, and map. A lot of things changed in my life by then and I took on a whole new adventure in career, travel, and even love. Then after many years, Witcher 3.   After finishing Blood and Wine, the final expansion, I uninstalled and finally closed this magnificent story that has been a part of me for the last nine years.  Now as my wife and I take on a new adventure into parenthood, I know that I won't have time to finish long RPGs anymore so this may be my last hurrah. That being said, this game, its story, characters, lore, will remain with me moving forward, defining what story and videogames can and should be.  Goodbye and see you Witcher. Salute.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"(This review has now been moved to my original account,  please view the review here:  Updated Review )  Its hard to try and summarise a game that has so much depth, because it truly deserves more then just a review for recognition. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has got to be one of the greatest single player games I've ever played, and that is from somebody that is not accustomed to the previous two titles.   With so many areas to talk about, I'll first mention about game dialogue. Considering an average novel is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, the script to Witcher 3 accumulates to a 450,000 word goliath. Unbelievable! It requires over 950 speaking roles, which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish. Whats slightly more incredible then those statistics, is that Witcher 3 makes you feel like you  don't  want to skip any of it whatsoever, through an amalgamation of whit, thrill, mystery, passion and more. I've never known a game to deliver dialogue so well, but on top of that its you that gets the choice of how the story goes. Your in control! You can continue to show Geralt as the renowned warrior he is, or you can often show his softer side in certain situations. There is no right or wrong. Even towards the latter stages, Co-developer Marcin Iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings for the game, mind = blown.   The environment to Witcher 3 is also a great achievement in itself. To put it into perspective, the map is 20% larger than Skyrim. Its also 35 times larger than the map found in Witcher 2. A large map is a good feat on its own, but these facts give CD Projekt Red massive bragging rights! At first it felt like the environment was very much going to be the same throughout, and I was really wondering whether or not there would be massive differences later on. As it turns out there is so much more in the lands of Witcher 3 to explore, in which I was extremely keen to find for myself.   You get to see a lot of the world through the storyline, but stepping away from that and doing side quests &amp; contracts are where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances. I can't honestly tell you another game thats genuinely made me want to do  everything . Each side quest feels like a mini-storyline, you don't seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature. On one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that Velen and Skellige have to offer, then on the other side you'll be hunting treasure, balls deep in Nekker swamps.  You'll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests, treasure hunts and contracts. It can sometimes lead to confusion, but the easiest way to clear your Journal is to go through them one by one. Obviously due to level restrictions, some of them cannot be completed until Geralt is stronger - which doesn't mean you can't try to do them, it just means that it will be incredibly difficult to do so. One moment that I will always remember is when I went to fight a Royal Griffin that was 12 levels higher then me. I would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain, but its almost like the Griffin was laughing at me, all I seemed to do was shave feathers off its back, nothing more. Then in one foul swoop, I'd be dead. Repeat. Dead. Repeat. Dead. ♥♥♥♥. I'm one that embraces difficulty, playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic, yet this was a battle that I  had  to swallow my pride and leave. Go away. Get stronger. Come back, and rip that ♥♥♥♥ing bird to pieces. This was great, not many times have I been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level, you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level. With this said, I actually much preferred Witcher 3's approach, it created some great and memorable fight scenes where I wouldn't necessarily assume victory. Certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on, so returning to them 50+ hours later provides a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power.   Now I remember all those years ago, playing cards in a big Saloon in Red Dead Redemption. Poker, Blackjack, maybe a little bit of Five Finger Fillet or Liar's Dice. These were wonderful times. Now I have a new love, playing Gwent. Gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. 'Invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play, Gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth, something beloved by both road-weary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties.' I have no idea how much time I've spent playing Gwent in this game, all I can say is that 25 hours into this game I was Level 3. 3! Gwent immediately took my focus as I attempted to gain recognition throughout Velen. Its a continous side quest in the game, challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments, not only that but also every merchant is up for a game. Just when you think your building a great deck and come out of a tournament as the winner, a local fishmonger will always be ready to embarass you (early on anyway, it becomes a breeze later on in game). There is also a quest to collect them all, so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of Nilfgaard, Northen Realms, Monsters &amp; Scoia'tael.   I've always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting, particularly when the mechanisms are right. I have heard mixed reviews about the mechanisms to Witcher 3 combat, some arguing that Geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack... absolute garbage. I think combat can be pretty tricky in Witcher 3 for those unfamiliar with the series, considering the many different mechanics in play at any one time. Blocking, parrying, signs, pivots, rolls, variant of sword, etc. Practice makes perfect, and it is different to other games so get used to it! Thats all I can say. Dismemberment is always a joy to behold, and Geralt doesn't hold back on his capability to carve through people, creatures and monsters like butter.  Could this game have anything to make it better? Yes &amp; it does - Free DLC. Not just a few, but 16! 16 Free DLC packages to add even more into a well-packed game. CD Projekt Red have had the best launch I've seen of a game, in terms of its update structure and responsiveness to people's comments. From launch there was new DLC every week, patches to address issues and bugs retaining in-game. Free DLC includes new armor sets, the ability to visit a barber, new quests, contracts, animations, alternative looks, and not to forget the NEW GAME + mode.   I put this review on hold numerous of times as it deserved to be reviewed once completed, it truly is a remarkable and well made game that will forever have the highest of impacts on me. Its groundbreaking in every sense of the word, and literally pisses all over certain companies that think its right to strip a new game of content then release it as paid DLC. Congratulations to CD Projekt Red for providing one of the most immersive &amp; detailed games that I have ever seen, I look forward to the expansions 'Hearts of Stone' &amp; 'Blood and Wine' to continue my witcher journey!",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Honestly this game is brilliant. I'm 30 hours in and feel like I have not even started yet. The maps are huge, and quite intimidating. There are lots of things to see and places to explore. Sometimes randomly exploring places you will find a hidden letter or item that leads you on a new quest. Speaking of quests, the secondary ones tie in beautifully with the main story and feel like they have meaning and purpose behind them. The visuals are stunning, especially if you have a rig capable of using HairWorks and HBAO+ to their full potential. The day/night cycle on top of the changing weather conditions really engross you in the world. The sound, both ambient and effects, are all awe inspiring. Just listening to the wind blow the trees, the village sounds of hammer on steel and axe on wood, even the gentle noises your horse makes as you travel is just very immersing.   The story telling is one of the major positives for me personally. All the NPC’s really come alive with the texture and detail on their faces, CD Projekt RED did a great job with that. The voice acting is great, much better than Witcher 2 and feels far more professional. All of the conversation options are well thought out, and there are plenty of decisions with some severe consequences depending on the way you play it. If you import a Witcher 2 save, you will have a few surprises and reappearances as well.  Combat is solid, it takes a little practice to get to grips with the dodging, parrying, and when to use the signs effectively, but once you work it out you will love fighting some mobs. The skill tress are varied and in-depth, and you can really tailor your play style by equipping/unequipping specific skills for different scenarios. Using mutagens to further develop and buff your abilities.   There is so much more I could talk about like Gwent, the card game, bartering/intimidation mechanics, boat sailing, all the crafting and potions, but you need to play it yourself to really appreciate it. Hopefully with further updates and user mods the game will continue to improve and evolve.   There are not many negatives, mostly performance related which, as of writing, a lot of have been fixed already with v1.03.  ",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is a masterpiece. It is possible that it is the greatest rpg game ever. Side quests are not boring, the game world is huge, weapons are great and combat although has some minor problems, is glorious. No game is perfect, this game has some problems, but the combination of great atmosphere, depth story, attention to details, quest diversity, sound, voice acting, music, monsters, weapons, armors, storms, Roach (the Horse) and of course the best mini game I have ever encounter in a video game : Gwent. All of this plus dozens of other great things add up and to give 10/10 masterpiece.  ***Keep reading for a few more details if you are interested:  • Side Quests: I will not specifically mention any side quest because I don’t want to spoil anything. But I have to praise the quality of the side quests. I have played a lot of rpg’s in my life, and I have never encountered one whose secondary quests are so well written. Even the smallest one of them have something interesting, for example a dead guy can have a note on his body which narrates something related to his final demise. Also, I’m not exaggerating when I said that the stories of this quests are amazing, going even head to head with main stories of other games. (Some of these quests endure 2 or 3 or more hours). Also, the main quests are amazing.  • Monsters: Yes, there are monsters in this game, and you will hunt them down and probably kill them (occasionally you may let them live if you choose so). But the best part is that you can track this monsters down with something similar to “detective mode”, which will give you hints of what kind of monster you are tracking, also villagers may help to determine of what kind it is. And there is strategy in this: monsters have weakness to something, it varies from monster to monster. To learn about this weaknesses you can read the “bestiary”, which is a log of entries that have descriptions, histories and details of monsters. There are necrophages, specters, giants, insectoids, draconoids and many others. You mostly track them down by accepting or taking Witcher Contracts.  • Potions, Crafting, Alchemy: Yes this game has all of this. I as a player usually don’t waste time with alchemy, but I really enjoy it in this game. There are dozens of potion recipes and diagrams for armor, and swords that you will encounter in the game world. And they are meaningful, not like in Skyrim, were you have like a million useless potion in your pockets. In here I actually use them, especially while fighting monsters. For example, there a different kind of oils that can be applied to your swords, each one add damage bonus to a specific kind of enemy.  • Graphics, sounds and music: Yes, I was a little bit disappointed when I saw all of the graphic downgrade posts and news, and yes there is some downgrade if you compare the game with the e3 trailers. Now that said, even with the downgrade, the graphics have remained impressive. Armors, lighting, reflections all of them looks well. The game atmosphere is amazing, there are storms, strong winds, rain, thunders and even the occasional fog is some areas. So don’t let the “graphic downgrade” thing affect your judgement of this game. It’s pretty. The sound is top quality too. And the music is also top quality.  Combat: The combat control is not perfect, specially the first few hours. But as you become more familiar with controls you will really enjoy and master its mechanics.  •Geralt of Rivia: And remember you are a Witcher, a guy who is basically an expert swordsman and alchemist, but at the same time have some basic knowledge of magic spells (like kinetic blasts and fire bursts). This is not an rpg were you create a character, in here you play with a forced role, you play as Geralt of Rivia and you have no choice in that matter. But this is not a bad thing. You will feel like Geralt and live as him…and decides like him. Geralt will have to deal with hundreds of choices in his adventure, those choices have different outcomes. If you had never played any Witcher games, let’s said that this is something similar to mass effect choices (but better). Also, you can import your save files from Witcher 2, so decision in there has some interesting outcomes in Witcher 3. If you have never played any witcher game, don’t worry, you will still understand the game.  • Progress: Yes there is ability tree and all that stuff, so you as you gain xp you can invest points in different abilities like magic, combat and alchemy (and a general attribute section).  • Gwent: This is an in game card mini game. I’m one of those guys who usually ignores all mini games in games. But you should try Gwent. It has a lot of depth and strategy. At the beginning it may be difficult, but as you progress you will earn new cards that will help you in your Gwent career…try the mini game, is amazing.  Update: 11/10",1,1

It has one or two flaws (most of which will be resolved with the Add-Ons), but you'll have to be really, really picky to find them, if you'll even notice.  Only problem with this game is that it still finishes  me  even upon finishing the game for the third time and that I have absolute no idea what to play next -- for whatever it will be, I will be sorely disappointed.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Genre - Open Worlded Fantasy RPG  I have played through the Witcher 1 and 2 until the end of both. Recently I read all the English translated books by Andrzej Sapkowski (a hero and they are highly recommended).  I have already ploughed 80+ hours into this game by doing many exploration, sub and main quests. I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out).  The monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a season pass if you want even more Witcher goodness.  The fighting is fluid and there are horse races, crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game. Shame there are no sex cards this time though ;-)  The graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure, not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary. You actually feel like you are making a difference to the world around you, liberating towns and developing relationships.  This is one of the best games I have played. I won't say game of the year just yet, but it is clearly going to be in the top five!",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I admit I was a bit concerned over the few years that The Witcher 3 was being developed. Hearing how CD PROJEKT RED decided to go 'open-world' and make the game 30 times larger than the previous Witcher games. These games were always more about substance for me and 'open-world' games tend to lose some of that. I wasn't so sure it would work. Then, the game then was delayed in 2014. Wasn't a good sign for me.   Soon after it was released, I picked it up. I spent the first few hours just taking in how beautiful and detailed the game world was. The water, trees, animals, grass..everything felt alive. I started playing the game and got hooked. The main questline itself was full of characters you grow to love and care about and a story that you typically don't get in a video game. The side quests in the game weren't your typical 'fetch this' or 'Kill this' type..all of them had a story and decisions to make on how to complete them.  The combat seemed clunky at first but then you start to realize this isn't a button mashing game, patience and timing was the way to go. It can be on the easy side on the normal difficulty levels, especially when only using your sword for combat but it gets more interesting when you start to use alchemy and signs.   In the end, I couldn't believe how great of a game this ended up being. The game's production values and writing are some of the best I've ever seen. Although I spent 150+ hours in my first playthrough of this game, I was bummed it was ending. Rarely do I feel like that after playing a game of this scale. It really is amazing how much CD PROJEKT RED put into this and they easily made one of the best games I've ever played.",1,1

You just don't know what to do in your life anymore. But seriously, I loved everyone minute of this game, and really tried to stretch it into the most hours. The main story is awesome, I loved messing around with Ciri and my Witcher buddies. I felt like every decision was important, and the game does a really good job of that. The consequences for decisions may be immediate, or will present themselves over time, whether they be good or bad. I love this game, and eagerly await the lengthy expansions.

While previous Witcher games featured a more linear level structure, The Witcher 3 is the first to introduce a completely open world that is described by the developers as 20 percent larger than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.  Geralt is a Witcher, a spellsword trained and mutated from childhood to become a near-superhuman monster slayer. The game’s prologue finds him in search of the two most important people in his life: his lover, Yennefer, and his adopted daughter, Ciri. For different reasons, both are being pursued by a terrifying supernatural force known as the Wild Hunt. Like a lot of things in life, this game is much more about the journey than the destination. Geralt’s journey sees him make his way through three huge, distinct, and open areas of the Northern Kingdoms and their surrounds. Roman Empire analogue Nilfgaard is on the brink of completing a crushing invasion of them, but begins the game in a temporary stalemate against the last two of these kingdoms, united under the banner of the stern king Radovid V.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt expects and rewards preparation above all else. Anybody who plays it like an Assassin’s Creed title or other action game will find themselves reloading frequently — I should know, because that’s how I initially approached it. Mashing attack might kill a few stray dogs, but that’s about it, as I found out. Side quests are all but mandatory, as enemies do not scale to the player’s level. It’s one among many ways that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt makes you feel like one man in a very large world. That’s one of the things I really appreciated about the game. The tutorial, if enabled, will nudge you once or twice, but afterwards will leave you with plenty of rope with which you are free to hang yourself with. Multiple save files are a must for this reason.  The game’s soundtrack was generally fairly restrained, but battle seemed to bring out the silly side of it. Each time the chorus of wailing warrior women got started, I felt like Geralt and I had stepped into an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. In a way, that’s an apt comparison. As Geralt slashes, pirouettes and leaps through skirmishes, I can’t help but think of Xena, beloved in part for its occasionally slapstick choreography.  Combat is both challenging and rewarding. Experimentation is again, encouraged: I found that one of Geralt’s signs, minor spells that Witchers cast, was able to knock men from horses. From there, Geralt was able to execute the grounded fighters without a struggle. I realised that a similar technique could be applied to flying enemies, and cursed myself for having not thought of it earlier. It wasn’t too long ago that I had been fighting a griffin, after all.  Signs, swordplay, bombs, potions and oils are Geralt’s main tools in combat, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s crafting ensures that you’ll be making the majority of them yourselves. Weapons and armor both degrade over time, and require repair in order to function properly. For a small fee, craftsmen can also take materials provided and upgrade Geralt’s current gear or craft entirely new items for him. You’ll find yourself spending a lot of time in the company of blacksmiths, so why not challenge a few to some cards?  That’s where Gwent, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s amazing minigame, comes in. Gwent has its roots in games like Goofspiel, being a simple game to learn but a complex one to master. Supposedly an analogue for how a battle unfolds, Gwent sees players placing numbered cards across three different zones. The first player to have the highest numbers on their side of the board for two rounds wins. It’s not as crucial a part of the game as Triple Triad was for Final Fantasy VIII, but it was compelling enough that I had to force myself away from it, lest this turn into Gwent: A Review.  Load times are disguised by short recaps of relevant main quests, matched to panning images like the one above. Unless you’re re-loading a save or just opening the game, you won’t actually see them often at all. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt really is an open world. Gone are the days of plotting where to base your Skyrim life to minimize loading transitions: if you see something in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you can usually walk up to or inside of it.  On the presentation and visual side, The Witcher 3 delivers one of the more engrossing and atmospheric game worlds seen in awhile. From trees waving in the wind to waist-deep swamps, everything about the game's visuals create a world that effortlessly combines real-world beauty with fantasy and medieval themes. The game world is presented in such a way that each territory, and the people that reside in its cities, are unique in their views on the current war, not to mention differences in their clothing and armor. Larger cities feature shady characters walking about streets and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on corners promoting brothels, while a smaller, more controlled city only contains nobles and streets that are well maintained. While there is a fast travel system, it's far more enjoyable and atmospheric to use Geralt's horse Roach, or to sail across rivers and oceans in a boat.  There’s a whole bunch of blacksmithing and alchemy plans to uncover and put to use as well. The world is chockful of components, particularly on the alchemy side, where the general wilderness seems to hold plants to collect every few 10 yards or so. It can get a bit overwhelming early on, but you’ll quickly learn that it’s not necessary to use or craft every potion or oil in the game, as you slowly mold your alchemy use to something that benefits your particularly playstyle. Crafting armor and weapons is fairly easy to do, but I found plans and competent crafters were a bit hard to come by.   The side contracts are where the game really shines. Where other open world fantasy games would treat bulletin board quests as a chance to make players gather ten bear butts through text only prompts, these can be just as nuanced as the main story chapters, with interesting twists on straightforward setups forcing the player to make the call as to who the real monster is. Even incidental missions and collectables filling up the map, while appearing too much like Ubisoft at first blush, manage to have something of a narrative seed embedded within. Treasure hunts often have examples of environmental storytelling and letters, and roadside encounters can lead to more complicated missions later on.  Story-wise, The Witcher 3 does an admirable job of giving new players enough information for them to understand the world in which they live, while also providing plenty of bonuses for long-time fans of the series. While some elements of the narrative are left vague for quite a while - what's the deal with the Wild Hunt, exactly? - you'll usually be too busy dealing with the dark, gritty, interesting world around you to worry about the bigger questions.  It’s hard to not spend all day singing The Witcher 3’s praises, but it really is a special kind of game. One that reminds you of how games can be engrossing experiences, ones you want to share with your friends, filled with moments that make you laugh, cry and sing along to a sweet ballad about the white wolf and the sorceress.  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ends Geralt’s tale in spectacular fashion, finding ways to fill a giant world with thrilling combat, beautiful sights, and a bevy of compelling content. A strong conclusion to The Witcher trilogy, and a masterpiece that will keep you enthralled for weeks and months to come.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Please do believe me when I say this.  I've never wanted to write a review for 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', because no matter   how much   you praise this game in your wall of text ...   you just can't do justice to this masterpiece.   Words can't possibly express nor describe this experience, this journey. To be honest, I don't know what else to say. Despite all that, I felt the urge to write   at least   something, even if it is just   a few   words.    After all, this is my favourite game of all time! A must-buy!        ... and don't get me started on the DLC! :)   ",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I've been gaming for well over 30 years. I've been PC gaming since before Windows even existed. I've long been an avid fan of story-driven RPG's, and there are not many out there I've not played. That being said, you can take my review with however large a grain of salt you may wish.   To say the game is vast belies the true scope. The designers wisely guide you from quest to quest in a flowing, natural way, almost always part of the story. Note that I said 'guide'. There is rarely any pressure or situations that lockstep you into a given path. You are free to make choices that let you go as deep down the rabbit-hole as you wish to go....   ...and that hole is very deep indeed.  'Story rich' is a term that has a nice, general sort of meaning to it, but again, does not do the efforts of CDPR proper justice. The game is so tightly wound into the books, that unless you have read them, you constantly miss the references that are so beautifully woven into the tale. If you have not read the books, you don't lose anything, but you definitely gain so much more for the knowledge.  The story, while deep and inviting, is marred a bit by the development of some of the characters. There are some that have a constant impact in the game, but the characters themselves feel somewhat shallow and undeveloped. Yennefer, for example: The character of the books is haughty, proud, complex, and passionate. The game character feels just b*t**y and moody. Some of them, however, are just delightful and give you real reason to 'buy in' to them (Zoltan and Dandelion come immediately to mind).  The environment - I am somewhat of two minds about the environment. Aspects of it are epic...the vistas from on high can be breathtaking. The play of light through trees and the colors at sunrise and sunset are a visual feast. There is a great deal to lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that is critical for immersion into the game world. But there are some things that blow that disbelief up quicker than a grapeshot bomb. The trees, bushes and grasses look very obviously two-dimensional. It was a disappointment that was lessoned somwhat by the variety in the landscapes, and the impact of weather on it, but it still was a bit of a jarring surprise when taken in context with the overall quality of the environment. Then there are the many inconsistencies in the way Geralt interacts with his environment (swimming on land, the inability to use terrain to your advantage in combat, getting stuck in trees, etc.).   Combat is by far the best iteration of all the games in the trilogy. It still remains a bit clunky (having to go into inventory, then go to your potions/food/bombs tab, then select the bombs you want to use, then exit out of all that, to have to go into the wheel and select the bomb before you throw it.....is a real pain in the @$$..... would have made far more sense to allow the user to simply click on the bomb slot in the power wheel and get a pop up inventory of just bombs. Same for potions slots and special slots.) But beyond those inconveniences, the blend of signs and attacks, coupled with dodging, parries, and combat rolls makes for an engaging, flowing combat experience. Some fights are simply acrobatic melees, while others require careful patience, waiting for the right time to strike, while maintaining a stout defense to avoid getting one-shotted.  Now, all this having been said, I have to admit that I was more than a bit disappointed that CDPR fell into the same trap of American publishers: putting the game out before all the bugs were ironed out. There have already been 8 patches and still there remains a plethora of irritating bugs (inability to talk to certain npc's that you should be able to talk to without meditating for an hour first or the flank speed on boats not working are the two most immediate that leap to mind)  Yes, there are pros. Yes there are cons.   But even with the cons, I would easily match this to The Mass Effect Trilogy, or the Dragon Age trilogy, as one of the most enjoyable RPG experiences I've ever had in gaming. I've already played the game 3 times, back to back, and working on a 4th with the new Game + (which really is the exact same game with everything made higher level....I've not yet seen a benefit to this yet).  Watching Geralt's beard grow as time goes by was just a huge giggle for me. It was a neat touch. Watching whales in the ocean broach by my boat as I sailed by gave me no end of delight. I parked Geralt on a mountain top in Skellige and watched an entire sunset. I checked myself into Gwent Addicts Anonymous.  Would I recommend this game? Without a breath of hesitation. Then I would immediately advise to take the bugs with a grain of salt, and get lost in this rather amazing world, and thoroughly enjoyable story.  Go, and see just how deep that rabbit hole is.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"It's strange how the main game, Gwent, is hidden in some kind of wierd story-driven RPG. The RPG is okay too I guess.",1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I don't know if I can adequately explain why this game is as amazing as I think it is.... but I'll try.    The Good     The writing  Hands down, this game has some of the best writing I've ever experience in an RPG. The main quest feels very personal, and you actually want to progress in order to find out what happens next. The characters are all interesting and also incredibly well-written.    The quests  Again, this game has the best side quests out of all the RPGs I've played. And that's saying a lot. Every quest seems to have at least some back story. There's typically at least a few forms of interaction other than just killing something and then returning to the quest giver. The decisions you make are never black and white, and usually involve some form of consequences. And FINALLY, you actually get to feel like a real witcher\monster hunter by taking on some really fun witcher contracts.    The world  Velen and Skellige can both rival some of the largest open worlds out there in terms of size, and yet the level of detail and polish remains consistent throughout. Exploration is very rewarding. There's loot to be found everywhere, and little quests can be unlocked along the way to help you find even more treasure.   Novigrad is a HUGE city, and you just walk inside without a hint of a loading screen. It actually feels like a living, breathing world. NPCs have daytime\nighttime routines, and will seek shelter if it starts to rain. Little things like that go along way to bring you into a world.   Graphics and art design  How can I put this? All things considered, The Witcher 3 is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played. You must experience this game in motion, but  feel free to look through my screenshots if you need convincing.  [www.flickr.com]  One thing that can't be seen in screenshots is the way everything moves and feels alive. And while the wind effect might seem overdone, it really helps to sell the atmosphere.   The Witcher 3 can be rough around the edges and other games are definitely doing some more impressive things technically, but the overall Witcher 3 experience is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.    The combat  This grew on me. At first I didn't like it. I didn't think signs were strong enough, and I was constantly getting my butt kicked. But then I learned how to dodge and counter properly. I learned how to use signs to my advantage, I learned how to stick and move, and start treating each encounter like a puzzle. Eventually I was punching WAY above my weight, taking on level 20 witcher contracts with a level 14 character. Now I love the combat and I'm always looking forward to doing the next Witcher contract.    The Bad     Controls  Quite possibly my biggest gripe with the game. Controls just feel clunky at best. I play with a mouse and keyboard, so maybe that is part of the reason... but movement in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive. Sometimes I'll try to move Geralt a little bit and he won't budge, and at other times he'll move too far and run off a cliff. Just turning around can feel like a chore as Geralt has a rather large turning radius. Even worse are the horse controls, which kinda feels like driving around a very large SUV. Constantly getting stuck on geometry and trying to maneuver around it is an ongoing, frustrating chore.   Balance  Even on the largest difficulty, it doesn't take long for this game to become a cake walk. IF you enjoy the sidequests like I do, you'll likely spend a lot of time completing them instead of doing the main quest. The main quest is GOOD, but some of the game's best content can be found in the sidequests. And after 20 hours of questing, you'll probably find that the next step in the campaign is 5 levels below you and therefore not challenging in the slightest. There were several instances where I'd go up against an enemy that is supposed to be tough and intimidating... but I kill it in less than 12 seconds.  Loot progression is also a joke if you do any kind of crafting. The witcher gear is probably better than anything the game will give you from monsters or chests. During your travels, you'll come across countless relic quality swords. And they may even have more damage than your current green sword. But witcher gear is highly specialized and usually compliment specific builds. Using a higher damage sword might actually gimp you if you lose a massive bonus to sign intensity, or adrenaline point gain.    Other stuff...  There's still so much I could go into. Replay value is probably lower since you only have 1 character to play as, but the game makes up for that with a much more personal and involved story. Gwent is probably a very fun card game, but I still haven't played a single game due to not wanting to dump a ton of time into it. Some day I will. Witcher sense is fun at first, but after a while it will feel like a chore. Having to hold down the button combined with the ridiculous screen effects really hampers my enjoyment of this commonly used mechanic. And you never feel like you're solving an investigation using witcher sense. Just looking for red stuff on the ground and following on screen prompts while Geralt figures everything out for you.     Conclusion   I can not possibly cover everything there is to cover about this massive game. But I can say that the good FAR outweighs the bad, and that this is is my favorite open world RPG of all time. I know that The Witcher series isn't for everyone, but I think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.   And again, if you need convincing that this game is drop-dead gorgeous, have a look through my screenshots :)   https://www.flickr.com/photos/jim2point0/sets/72157653074223832 ",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is so spot on in so many areas that it's hard to review. Imagine a really, really good movie, with action and suspense and wry comedy and adult themes. Now imagine that it has its own world, its own lore, and you're actually playing a character in it, becoming doubly invested in the characters' stories. I know that this is the promise of so many other games, but The Witcher 3 actually delivers like no other game.   The difficulty is super scalable so that you get just as much tension as you want, making it excellent even for 'casuals.' I have spent nearly 200 hours on just one playthrough, without a break in which I played something else. I've been gaming since the days of the Tandy 1000, and I have never put this kind of time into a game. And I'm looking forward to delving into the DLC.   If there was a game that deserved, in content, quality, enjoyability, and sheer production quality, to be far higher than the $59.99 AAA mark, this would be it. And it's $39.99 right now. You need to play this game, now, while everything is still the BEST that exists. Don't let this one be one of those that you put off for ten years, only to 'meh' at it when it's cheap. If you buy one AAA game in 2016 and 2017 combined, it should be this one.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Finally the epic finale for the story of Geralt of Rivia arrived. Combining the best of Open World RPG and story driven RPG CDProject tried to offer the best of both worlds, so to speak.  While many say it is the next skyrim, i always had to think more of Red Dead Redemption in fantasy. Both games had a fixed main character, which is only so far customizeable, which is a big difference from Skyrims system. Also the dark and gritty settings, with their bit of melodramatic storyline, exploring all the mostly bad sides of humanity are quite similiar.  Naturally the witcher has the plus of a more 'interesting' background world, filled with magic, war and monsters, as well as being the finale to a story spanning three games and many books.  Also CDPR did the trick to create an open world, which not only looks beautiful and offers an nearly unbelievable amount of possibilities to do, but also kept the content of the great amount of quests so unique that none feels the same.. and surely not like the boring MMO grinding stuff, for example some bioware products of late do.  The characters are also very well made, and i surely couldn´t believe the stupidity of some 'gaming journalists' whining about how Witcher 3 favors anti female and racist content. Anyways, naturally even this new RPG masterwork isn´t without it´s flaws. Sadly some bugs still can annoy players, one which even seems to be introduced with the last patch, disturbing some character models. Though i trust CD Project to solve this in due time. One of the other controversies about this game seem to concern the problems for a game, which is made both for consoles as well as pc to be optimised for both. While on the one hand some graphic options had to be tuned down, due to the limited possibilities of the consoles, the menus and texts, which were quite fine on pc, we´re often complained about by console players.  This section confesses nearly all of the bad points for Witcher 3 though, there are very few things i can say about the actual game, which are really negative. Maybe that your witcher has to be a cleptomanic as*, who steals everything, which isn´t nailed down, to use it in the very innovative crafting system. Or that one of the new mini games, a card game named Gwent, steals way too much time of actual playing, since it´s addictional content. But all this fades against the atmosphere of a war-ridden Novigrad, where beggars and ♥♥♥♥♥s, meddle with fanatics and witch hunters.  Conclusio: This really set´s new standards for open world as well as roleplay games imo. Definitive recommendation, not only for fans of Geralt.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"There are on occasion certain convergences and synergies that give rise to human creations destined to transcend and expand the role and scope of art and storytelling. That's when these creations border on myth. What distinguishes them is that they are not exclusively the work of a single mastermind; instead they become collaborations that span across years, decades, and encompass the minds of several artists, writers, visionaries. Such is the Nietzschean mythology of DC/Marvel superheroes; such is the Darwinist mythology of Planet of the Apes; and such is the Slavic-Tolkienian saga of The Witcher.  My personal maxim when it comes to games is: Gameplay is king; Story is queen. I have little to no interest in games with no story or even lore; and also no interest in games with only story (I'd rather read a book in that case). The seamless combination of both is what interests me the most, and very few games achieve this blend as Wild Hunt has achieved. This game is the embodiment of the perfect balance between gameplay and story.  CDPR, the developer, has achieved the highest effect a game can have on its players: making them wish that it never ends. For the last five months I have delayed and put off the ending as long as I possibly could, wishing that this game could last forever; that I could play it for the rest of my life, always finding new side quests, new contracts, new treasure hunts. But alas, all great things must end; it's what makes them great. And in this case, The Witcher series ended on an incredibly high note. The fact that the developer has decided to conclude the story of Geralt with this game, instead of finding a way to milk the franchise also speaks volumes of their integrity as artists.  This is a game that is exuberantly alive: it bustles and teems with life. Walking through the woods, walking through a city, into a cave... you feel life around you, especially if you play with a good headset. The feeling of riding across the lands as the sun sets is something I'll never forget. I'd never played a game that felt so alive, so rich, so handcrafted in its minutest details. Some games came close, but probably due to limitations of technology and development cycle, they didn't achieve this level of liveliness and exuberance.  I usually don't like cutscenes in most games, to be very honest, but in this game I couldn't get enough of it. The voice acting, the character animation, especially facial animation, is beyond anything we've come to expect from games in terms of quality, and most games now pale in comparison, seeming lifeless and dull. No wonder some critics said that it 'defines next-gen': this game is technically and artistically unparalleled, and it should set a gold standard to be aspired to by all AAA devs in the coming years. Not that most of them will ever achieve something this great, but they should at least aspire to greatness.  There are moments where its writing is at its best the fewer words are used: Geralt and Ciri trashing a certain place was particularly brilliant. But the writing here is among the best a game has ever seen. From my own personal preference, only the writing in Fallout: New Vegas could equal the writing in Wild Hunt. The variety of soundbites in cities and villages, the different personalities ascribed to vendors (a blacksmith mourning his son, an armourer who is not what he seems, a grumpy merchant, etc etc etc)... From the very first quests, the inner life shown by these characters is simply staggering: a lone hunter in the woods, a very minor character, who considers himself a freak, has more inner life than most protagonists in most games out there.  This brings us to the question of empathy. Here we feel such empathy for these characters, even as we know that they are nothing but a complex arrangement of ones and zeroes (technically speaking) and we feel for even the most despicable among them, such as the Bloody Baron. Only in TV series such as The Sopranos and Breaking Bad have I felt such empathy for men whom I would personally loathe if I ever came across them. This is top-notch writing in action. We care for the characters in such a way that it’s hard to hold back the tears at certain points in the story. The only complaint I have, as some others have as well, is that the main villains are not as developed as they could be: Imlerith and Eredin in particular could have been much more interesting, as even minor characters came out more interesting than them. Especially compared to Letho, the villain in Assassins of Kings, the villains here are very flat. It is a minor complaint, though, in the grand scheme of the game.  On to the gameplay. The investigation component, though not exactly innovative, is employed so deftly that it makes for one of the most satisfying elements in the game: finding clues and picking up scents is just fun and it makes you feel like a supernatural detective. I know some players had objections to the combat, but I have no complaints whatsoever. Especially on higher difficulties, it is clever, tactical, challenging and just plain fun. You don't have to mash your buttons or click your mouse to death here, instead you have to pace yourself, prepare for each fight, try to get the right oils and signs and bombs ready. It can be awkward sometimes, but that's a matter of skill. The better you become at combat, the more surgical and graceful you can become, which makes it extremely fun and satisfying.  As an RPG, well, purists may argue that The Witcher series in general is not a true RPG because you will always be Geralt of Rivia: you will always be bound and limited by his personality, skills and fighting style. Yes, true enough. But within these bounds there is a freedom to build a character that is unique, not only in the dialogue choices that ultimately impact the story, but in the way you approach the world and what you do with it.  In terms of mechanics, I have had no problems whatsoever. Not a single crash, only some very minor and mildly amusing glitches. As I said before, this game is technically unparalleled. CDPR's engine is the perfect expression of Clarke's third law: advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Apart from some shoddy textures here and there, the game is truly magical in its beauty and scope. It is an open world without invisible walls, where the sky and the oceans are the limits.  The soundtrack is a work of art in itself. For the past two months I've started reading the books while listening to the soundtrack, and it makes for a very satisfying combination. It fills you with longing and transports you to the world of the Witcher while your body sits there in the bus, going to work or wherever. It is that good, seriously.  Flawed as only the greatest masterpieces can be, Wild Hunt is a tour de force to be reckoned with. It is a world built by some of the most creative and innovative minds in the games industry; it is a game carved and handcrafted as a labour of love with only the varnish of commercial value. Wild Hunt redeems the videogame medium; it elevates art and storytelling to a whole new level that we can only hope will come to be imitated, however imperfectly.

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Day 1 Review:  Pros - No crashes - Beautiful graphics (seriously) - Runs smooth on a mid-range machine - Top-notch atmosphere  Cons - I haven't seen boobs yet   *Actual Initial Impressions* (will continue to update)  Relevant Specs: i7 2600k @ 4.4GHz GTX 680 w/ 4GB RAM 8GB RAM Windows 8.1  Actual Pros:  - Performance on my system has been better than expected (50-60fps @ 1080p). I am running postprocessing and the majority of the graphics options on HIGH. I have the hair-effect turned off as it does degrade my FPS.  - The world feels alive. From the wind blowing through the trees, to the dynamic weather system, to the wild life running through the forest, nothing stands out as generic or as an asset that was placed into the world without thought. The first two areas are more organic than any other game I have personally played.  - The side-quests are varied and offer up much more than fetch this or kill that. Many are investigation based and require multiple steps to complete.  - The UI has taken a MASSIVE step forward from The Witcher 2. What was once a clunky mess is now fairly intuitive and streamlined. There is room for improvement, but clearly the developers have learned from their past mistakes.  - The graphics are beautiful, but please don't expect a fully modded Skyrim or iCEnhancer GTA4 level of detail. Again, the developers seemed to be more concerned with making a world that feels organic and vivid than throwing 24k textures on everything. It's the art, color, and texture cohesion that really makes the graphics standout from other titles.  - The dialogue and voice acting are on par or better than most action RPGs I have recently played. I have yet to encounter two NPCs that I felt were using the same voice actor. The only generic voice in the game is probably the protagonist, but that is by design.  - I have not encountered any bugs worth mentioning. Zero crashes and no broken quests is impressive for any game when compared to other recent major releases.  Actual Cons:  - While the soundtrack and game ambiance are very well done, the game suffers from sound balancing issues. For example, at certain times the sound level of voices will be much lower than everything else in the world, forcing you to read the subtitles.  - There is an overuse of 'stage setting' mini-cinematics, especially if you play in short bursts and load often. There should be an option to skip these and instead be able to read the suggestion text during a loading screen.  - Level progression has been quite slow which has forced me to back-pedal a bit from the main quest to play catch-up. This may be by design, but placing you into an area that is for level 7+ while you are only level 3 isn't the best choice IMHO.  Bottom Line: I will continue to play The Witcher 3 for the foreseeable future. It offers a blend of DA:I and Skyrim-esque gameplay with it's own unique lore, dynamism, and atmosphere that is truly enjoyable. Please feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments and I will do my best to answer them.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"  'I'm a Witcher. Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other - for humans.'     - Geralt of Rivia    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TLDR  Just play the game. Its perfect. 10/10  TL;DR  The Witcher 3 is one of the best games I've ever played to date - probably the best I will ever play. It is now the bar I've set for gaming and will forever compare this masterpiece when progressing through future games. Never has a game pushed me to want to discover the lore of the world and read the novels which are written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Everything about this RPG is fantastic, it does have its flaws but it is as perfect as a game will ever be.     Story    From the get go, The Witcher sucked me into the world and really immersed me into the life of Geralt of Rivia. The game is more than just the main quest, although it is fantastically written and voice acted. The little things such as the side quests, are memorable and feel like you matter to someone's life - whether you are part of the quest or merely just an observer of the story. Every quest I took part of I ended single handedly or left feeling like I had an impact. Even walking away from an on going sub story never ended in my mind, it felt more than just a quest, it gave depth to the environment and the NPCs living around my story. In some cases the little stories which seemed very insignificant impacted my story. Each character was fleshed out and didn't feel unimportant and gave so much depth to the overall arc, characters gained and lost were impactful. Choices I made were important and changed the story and its outcome for better or for worst.    Gameplay    The gameplay is most memorable. Exploration was always exciting and interesting. No two missions feel the same. Finding NPCs needing help brought life to the open world. Exploring hidden treasure, points of power, and enemy hideouts were brilliant and added to the experience. At no point in the game did I feel bored or had nothing to do. Even with finishing the main campaign I still have to play Gwent, fufill the contacts/side quests, explore more secrets, discover the DLC and replay on the deathmarch difficulty. The character builds are varied and fun; alchemy is important especially in the higher difficulties; signs are fantastic; mutators can change the play style of Geralt, and there are so many armour sets can be used to give specific buffs and skills to your build. I feel like the movement took some getting used to, and the swimming was just god awful... But apart from that it was perfect!    Graphics    The Witcher 3 looks gorgeous, there were moments where I just hopped on Roach and took in the view. Its brilliantly done and I can see myself going around taking screenshots later for my showcase. I was able to run this game at 50-60fps on high with a few setttings turned down and it just looked amazing. One of the best looking games I've played thus far.     Sound    I listened to the OST before playing the game itself, I fell in love with all the music and playing The Witcher gave meaning to both the music and the game. The emotion of the song really immersed me into the story. Fights felt epic with the music playing. Even walking through Velen, Novigrad and Skellige with the conversation buzzing, the nature and the soft instrumentals were beautiful. Even after playing the game I still listen to the OST. The voice acting is brilliant, I loved all the characters.    Overall    I am not close to being finished with this game. There is still so much to discover. Its going to forever be my favourite game. This is exactly what games should be. The attention to detail and the execution of the story was brilliant. I wouldn't change a thing. Just fantastic. 10/10",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I'll start with saying that this is the Best game I have ever played.  This game is a master-piece, it should become a benchmark for all games, The amount of love poured to this game is just amazing, you can feel it while playing, hell, even by watching the trailers, From the small little details they've done, like Geralt beard that grows over time to the amazing landscapes and the just epic soundtrack. CDPR went all out in every aspect and they should get all of the respect!  The graphics of this games is perfect and I think the best looking game atm, and it's not just the looks, the atmosphere is just amazing, I have no words, Some areas in the game are just so detailed and crafted, it's just Art at it's finest.  The gameplay itself is just so fun! I loved every second of playing it, I have to say though, when you play it, play on the Death March! difficulty (hardest), why? because you need to play it like they intended, to get ready before the fight, taking potions, load specific bombs and apply oils, be more tactical when fighting the monsters.  The variety of the monsters is great, and every battle feels different, making you adjusting to each monster differently, use different tactics on Wraiths for example, like placing a trap while fighting them because if you won't, you barely scratch them when attacking, or calming an Alghoul before smacking him up because when he isn't calm, he got spike shield and every time you hit him, you get hit back and you will die very quickly, and these are just 2 examples out of many more monsters, and another thing i found very sweet is that the same monster looks differently when they're at a higher level or at a different place in the world, like a Fouglet for example, in the swamps he looks pretty plain, but if you go to the Skellige Islands, they look really different, wearing horns, this is just a small example of the love and small detail crafting that went into this game.  The quests and story, I don't think that there is any other game with the amount of depth that's in this game, even the side-quests are so complex and deep that they feel like their a main quest, the amazing animations, cutscenes and dialogs are made to prefection, allowing you to live it and feel so in the game as if it was a movie. There are 3 major ending and around 32 minor ending to specific characters and how the world changes, this just gives you an example on how rich and complex the story is.  I can go on and on and keep on praising the game, but I think you get my point.  TL:DR, Buy this game, even at full price it's worth it, this game is master-piece.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to hand out superlatives like 'best'. Normally whenever you try to unpack 'best', it's normally hard to quantify, or at worst, empty rhetoric.  That's why I was so surprised with myself. Around ten hours into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a question popped into my head. 'Is this the best game I've ever played?' I tried to dismiss it, re-frame it into something more subjective, but the question wouldn't go away. So I decided, 'what the hell, I'll finish the game and ask myself that question again.'  Now that I've finished the story, well... I think it is. From start to finish, Witcher 3 stands a full head and shoulders above every RPG I've played in almost every metric that matters to me. It has the most fully realized open world I've ever experienced. Its story and characters are deep and compelling. The game is immersive in ways I still can hardly believe. Its visuals are breathtaking, the music is fantastic. The amount of content--meaningful content, not flavorless side quests--is staggering.   The World  The current trend in open-world games seems to be using procedural generation to offer playable areas that are more than anyone could successfully explore in a lifetime. But I'm sure you've played a few games that promise this and deliver a world that's wide as the ocean and shallow as a puddle. Witcher 3 is the opposite of this. Every inch of Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige that you encounter is lovingly crafted. This is one of the only games I've played besides Elder Scrolls games where you can literally set off in a random direction and find self-sustaining adventure. tl;dr: better game than no man's sky/10   Narrative/Characters  The main story is fantastic. The world of the Witcher is noticeably cynical, and the game uses this to its advantage. The story's conflict hinges around very adult fears and uses very adult themes to drive these points home. You spend the vast majority of the game looking for Ciri, Geralt's adopted daughter. She's not held in some magic crystal, trapped but otherwise safe--you don't know what's happened to her, all you can do is search and hope for the best. The characters you meet, both supporting characters and general NPCs, are excellent. They're well-written, well-voiced, and well-animated, and it's a joy listening to them and hearing more about their stories. The story is branching, but the amazing part is that I can't tell you by how much. Normally, it's readily apparent in games with choices where exactly the story branches, but this game does an excellent job at hiding the seams. The consequences of your decisions aren't readily apparent until sometimes hours of playtime after you make them. tl;dr: feels/10   Immersion  I read reviews before buying this, and people kept saying the game was 'immersive'. I didn't believe that at first, but after playing the game, I can confirm that it's the strongest point of the game. You really do feel like Geralt of Rivia, an itinerant monster slayer who often gets wrapped up in things larger than the Path he walks. You feel like you have his powers--superhuman senses, reflexes, and an encyclopedic knowledge of supernatural monsters that the commonfolk only know in myths. The game is huge on player agency, allowing you to use what you know to solve problems as best you can. It's hard not to feel immersed when you're using your Witcher Senses to identify distant threats by sound.   Immersive Narrative   After you've played a lot of games that allow you to make decisions, you start recognizing tropes. 'If you unlock a special dialogue option, take it--nothing bad will happen.' 'If someone tells you they're misunderstood, they normally are.' Very early in the game, I let rules like this influence my decision, and the game slapped my wrist for it. I blinked, but I didn't listen and tried again on a more major plot point. The game punched me in the ♥♥♥♥. After that, I stopped trusting people at face value. I became willing to refuse people who I thought were lying to me. I started making decisions as Geralt of Rivia, instead of someone playing a video game. I almost always play RPGs as Neutral Good, doing what I think is right and helping everyone I possibly can whether they deserve it or not. The fact that a game could make me change this is absolutely massive. tl;dr: i'm a witchman/10   Content  I already talked about how much there is to do in the world, but it deserves a special mention that this game is priced at $50. My total runtime for completion of the main story quest and maybe 60-70% of sidequests and exploration was around 120 hours. None of that time was grinding for money, experience, anything of the sort--just pure adventure. I've played AAA games for $60 that didn't have 1/4th the content this one does. Not to mention, the myriad of free DLC the game comes with, and the absolutely massive expansion packs that I've, at the time of this writing, just barely dipped my toes in. It really boggles the mind and makes you wonder what some of these other video game companies even think they're doing. After playing this game, if it was priced at $90 or even $100, I'd still say it was worth it. And I didn't even mention Gwent. tl;dr: i owe CD Projekt Red money/10   Audio/Visual  The game is beautiful and runs exceptionally. I don't normally focus on graphics because it's more important to me that a game have a defined visual style, but Witcher 3 has one and it's beautiful. The music is excellent as well, carrying the desperation of life in Velen, the somber song of Skellige, and the carefree life (for some) of Novigrad.    Combat  This is the only part of the game that doesn't sparkle as brightly. It almost doesn't feel fair to say that, as combat in this game is very good, it just didn't dazzle me like the rest. I began to outlevel the foes I'd encounter while exploring, which trivialized combat. The game has a very good crafting and skill system to bolster your combat, but when the combat itself didn't stress me, I didn't feel much of a need to come up with clever solutions to problems. I've upped the difficulty for my playthrough of the expansions, so if I need to adjust this section later, I will.  All in all, this game is a masterwork. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs even a little bit. And for the foreseeable future, if anyone asks me what the best game I've ever played is, I will say the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I liked taking walks to watch the sunrise and sunset before I purchased this game. Now I just bask in the beautiful sun rising and setting over the Northern Realm. 100/10  Seriously, this game is ridiculously good. It definitely sets apart from other games in RPG. Actually in my honest opinion, this game should be a genre of its own. The story telling is ineffably amazing! Even the decisions you made in Witcher 2 can alter the universe in Witcher 3. That's just mind blowing. I am definitely going to finish Witcher 2 after completing Witcher 3, then replay Witcher 3 with the saved files and see how different Witcher 3 will be.   The quests in this game are always changing and exciting. I am a big fan of RPGs and have played several RPGs including Skyrim, Fallout, etc. but have always felt the stories were not captivating enough. I fell in love with this game after putting in 10-15 hours doing main and supplementary quests, slaying monsters on easy mode as I picked up the game mechanics. I have put in now 50 hours into the game over the past 5 days and have never felt bored or repetitive, and I don't even think I am halfway through the game yet. Each quest has a storyline that really hooks and connects you to the universe of the Witcher series whether it's a main quest or a side quest. Heck, I've done some quests that literally feature everything you can think of - slaying vampire, drunken sex with a transgendered elf (accidental of course), staging a play, watching somebody performing an autopsy, and many many more.   Lastly, I am no English major but I find the writing in this game sensational! Reading glossary on different characters and monsters and listening attentively to the dialogue are extremely satisfying and enjoyable. Even the love letter you looted from a corpse or note collected from a throng of bandits are worthwhile to read thoroughly. And who freaking knew there could be so many kinds of monsters - specters, ogroids, insectoids, draconids, etc. After this game if there ever was an apocalypse, I definitely will be the monster slayer guru.   If you are still for some reason wondering whether to pick up this game, I hope you'll find this review helpful. I seriously think this game is worth a lot more than $60 and I was happy to pre-order this game for $54. I am definitely picking up the DLCs.   TLDR: Game is amazingly well-written through both main and side quests. Game developers were very thorough. Pick up this game.  EDIT: Finished the game at 85 hours. Definitely was an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. Spent the following hour wandering around to finish random side quests but couldn't do it, felt so empty. Decided to buy Witcher 1 on Steam at full price to play the game despite its clunky mechanism, as well as the books and the comics. Also found out 16 free DLCs will be released before Heart of Stone. Definitely worth the purchase, down to every penny.  Now back to applying for jobs.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"First, let me summarize the negative reviews for you:  'I am mad about the hype around this game, so I'm not recommending it, because {INSERT REASON HERE}' The reasons could be:  - Somewhat confuse character control   - Game too easy/not hardcore enough  - Simple combat   - My pc can't run it on ULTRA at 144 fps  ========================================== Now to the actual review of the game:  From the beginning, this game is absolutely gorgeous. I spent a good time checking the visuals everywhere I went. The world really feel like real, like you could address locations by pointing trees along the way. Everything looks handmade and original.  The story is another thing this game does wonderfully. I nearly cried sometimes (no shame in it!) and Got really excited in some sequences. The storytelling and the cinematic are god-tier. This is by far the best aspect of the game.  Controls and combat system are different from TW2. The combat got easier (for the newcomers, I guess) and requires less strategy. Although the combat was made simpler, it is not boring at all, and the difficulty is adjustable so the strategy becomes neccessary sometimes. The controls, as opposite as some people say, I did not find bad. I played tons of games and I am always ready to get used to different movement mechanics.  In short, the game was fun and kept me motivated from start to finish. I would recommend this masterpiece to every gamer I know. I wish every game was like that. I would give it a 10/10, because I have ABSOLUTELY nothing to complain about the game itself. I found some bugs, but they did not compromise my overall experience and the patches were quick and effective.  10 out of 10. Waiting for expansions.",1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"10/10 - An outstanding masterpiece.   I've put a lot of time into this franchise. I've read all the books, and I've now played all the games. Honestly I think CD PR Red has done a better job with the franchise than Sapokowski himself.   Anyways, here are some pros/cons from my perspective.   Cons: - Quite a bit of glitches, but still nothing compared to what games like Skyrim/Fallout has - Lack of scaling. After the first 10 levels the game is very easy even on the hardest difficulty. Using time on potions, oils etc seems pointless as you progress into the game. NG+ doesn't really deal with this well. - Controls can be a bit clunky - drunk steed - some points of interest seems forced, rushed, and ultimately a not so much interesting point.   Pros: + Extremely good voice acting + One of the best open worlds in a game. The level-design is splendid. + IMO the best characters in any game, it is simply stunning how well the characters are made. The greatest strength of the game. You quickly tie an emotional bond to the characters, and all the main characters are very interesting, and complex.  + How about a round of cards? Gwent, specifically? + Brilliant soundtrack.  + Combat is versatile, interesting and challenging. First levels are very hard though. Variety of different signs and weapons to use. Expect something along the lines of Dark Souls in terms of moveset.  + Excellent graphics, and mostly very good optimization. I have a 980 and can do about 30 FPS in 4k(mostly 60 fps in 1080, but when it rains in the swamp it goes down to like 30 for some reason). This is one of the few games where NVIDIA's 4k setting really shines, as the textures in 1080p seem like garbage in comparison(check the trees, they're insane in 4k).  + Very good storytelling. The main story will keep most people hooked through the entirety of the game. I do wholeheartedly recommend to play TW2 before starting this however.The sidequests are the real surprise though, as I don't think anyone has put so much effort into sidequests in a game this big before. They are awesome.  + The sheer scale of the game. It is simply ridicolous. I have spent about 130 hours in the game on a playthrough. If you only care about the story and play on easy the game will take around 35-45 hours.  + Free DLCs, actual expansion packs; what's not to like? + Mod support, with sort-of ok mod tools + BEARD + Choices in the game have a very great impact on the outcome of the ending(s). + For those who read the books, the devs have done a good job putting in references here and there. Also, a lot of references to books, movies, games etc in general. You will chuckle.   My verdict: I have had so much fun with this game. One of the very few games that have managed to get to me emotionally. It has without a doubt become one of my favourite games, of all time. It's hard to put my finger on too many negative things here. There is a lot that could have been done better, sure, but compared to other games.. I don't think a game has to be perfect to achieve a perfect score, and based on the immensely enjoyable time I've had with this game, I give it a solid 10/10. I have played about 500 games, and this is the 2nd game I can give a 10/10 rating.   I wholeheartedly recommend to play Witcher 2 first, as you will get considerably more out of the game. Witcher 1 has horrible combat, and is very VERY hard to get through. I honestly wouldn't even try it until after TW3.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a game which I was actually thoroughly enjoying. The gun play and new mechanics added an interesting twist on the Call of Duty series.   I am however not going to write this as a positive review, simply because the game has marked me as cheating. Firstly I haven't even touched the multiplayer mode of Black Ops III - anyone who reads my reviews or checks my profile will see I have absolutely no interest in the multiplayer side of this type of game. I was playing the single player campaign, in offline mode.   Secondly, I wouldn't even know HOW to cheat, even if I wanted to. But one matter which really irks me is, even if I was cheating in single-player mode, why would anyone get a ban for that in the first place? Surely bans from playing multiplayer games should come when you play multiplayer? People who know me will know I am not that sort of person, where as people who read this will probably think I am just throwing my toys out of the pram. Believe who you wish at the end of the day. Heed my warning though.   Due to the lack of any support from Steam or Treyarch themselves, this will be the absolutely last Call of Duty game I ever buy, review, or even lay my eyes on. After doing some research into the matter, many people have been experiencing this issue, even people who play online, who just happen to be on a server with a cheater have received a ban as well.   I'm sorry Treyarch - take your game back to the consoles.     Tom's Score Card     1) Stay away   2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Activsion has done it again.  Black Ops 3 is out, and wait... what's this? more maps to buy already? Well, if that's what it will take to enjoy the game!  No one should have to spend more than the hefty price of $60 to get enough out of a game for them to enjoy it.  It's not that it's not a fun game, it is and can be, as anyone who has played a COD game before knows.  But once again Activision and Treyarch have thought it a good idea to charge the 'Triple A Price' for a game that really doesn't have all that much content.  Yes, go ahead and call me whatever you like.  Are you done now?  Once again, I don't 'Hate' the game. It's relatively fun like any FPS.   But MY G-D.  When will Devs learn?  See, instead of trying to help the game's negative and overall 'mixed' reviews, 'EA's little brother' has opted for simply 'making a sub-par game better at a price.'   ...Again.  If a free game on steam has a 'Mostly Negative' review, only the most idiotic developer would start charging 10 bucks for it and expect that to make the reviews start changing for the better.  Logic right?  Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with DLC's, when they are done well and simply add more to the base game that it already great and not lacking. -Skyrim is a pretty good example of this. The base game is great as it is, but if you want to sink more hours in, go ahead and pick up a DLC.  A not so great example is like 'Elite:Dangerous'.  An overall 'Mixed' set of reviews, for understandable reasons, Frontier's (Devs for) Elite:Dangerous decided that instead of improving the game to make it more enjoyable by simply updating it, (which I truly believe would have been a much more profitable and appealing way to expand the game than charging more money for a season pass for a base game that really doesn't have too much going for it.)   That, unfortunately is precisely what they did and will most likely continue to do.  I understand not every developer and game is gonna be like Warframe, where there is always new updates and almost always completely free to some extent, there is a line.  That line, is exactly what games and publishers like Black Ops 3 and Activision cross.  You don't make a game with one zombie map and charge extra for more when customers already spent up to $60 dollars on your game.  You don't keep adding more content for a price when the game simply needs it as an update to make it better.   You want to improve your reviews Activision?  Instead of demanding more money for less content, simply start adding more content and build up to the point where there is enough to do that people enjoy your game as it is. Then, you'll release DLC, and people will be a whole lot more open to the idea of putting in more money for a game they ALREADY enjoy.  Not putting in MORE money so they finally DO enjoy.  (And no, games Oozing with microtransactions. No, just, No. your games won't fix themselves.)  I get that Activision isn't gonna change, and most Developers that opt for poor marketing techniques won't.  But it's things like charging more than $60 for 2 games, one being a remaster, and the other one a game no one really wants that you MUST buy in order to recieve the remaster, that customers can't stand.  While some people are more than happy to shell out more money for your games, (to which I have no problems with) most would rather spend half the cost of $60 and take their money elsewhere.  It's really not the game I don't like, it's how they market and sell everything they make.    At the end of the day, Black Ops 3 is a relatively good game, and if there were a 'Meh' option instead of 'yes' or 'no' as far as recommendations go, I would've opted for that. I really just wish they would add another map or two to zombies, I mean, come on, they even tag it under 'zombies'. -_-   I would easily recommend this game if it were on sale, but as for full price, I would say it's not for everyone. Simple as that. Don't like it? Great! Like it? Great!",-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Call Of Duty Black Ops III: here are the ratings of the international press Now available for Windows PC, Call Of Duty Black Ops III receives ratings from international criticism. As you can see from the list below, the new chapter of shooter published by Activision has been judged positively by the press.   EGM – 9.5  GameTrailers – 9.2  GameInformer – 9  PlayStation Lifestyle – 9  Ausgamers – 8.8  Destructoid – 8.5  SixthAxis – 8  GamesRadar – 4/5  The Escapist – 4/5  Polygon – 7  Gamespot – 7  Giant Bomb – 3/5   Misleading?  Today's Review: Call of Duty: Black Ops III  Overview: So, like every year you can expect 2 things for sure: 1 Assassin's Creed game and 1 Call of Duty game, they will just keep going until they run out of ideas or ppl stop buying from them. Essentially this game takes part in 2054 i think and you become part of the Black Ops unit, an Augmented elite force that uses a new kind of techonology (somethinig related to your DNI) to performe different types of things like hacking, comunicating and other things, this review contains no spoilers of the story don't worry, so there's 3 parts of this review:  Singleplayer: (You can't pick weapons during that campaign that belongs to enemies from the floor) The story takes place in the year 2054, it seems that a new cold war it's going on and an event set in the start of game trying bio-augmentation on humans, neural implantations, bionic arms, etc. and for the first time, you get to see how your character looks like, you will be also called 'Player'. the 'RPG' part of the game were you get to choose your face it's extremly limited, so don't except more than 8 faces and they all pretty much looks like the same your gender and that's it. The SP it's pretty fun, full of enemies to shoot, walls to run over, robots to explode, drones to hack. The bad thing is the campain (also the MP) it's riddle with bugs, mostly annoying, i haven't finished yet, but it's like any cod except for MW2, a rather generic story pulled of the 10 minutes imagination time of an 14 years old, but hey, it's cod! we're here for the...  Multiplayer: A few big steps were made for this mode, but at this point some keep not being made, like no dedicated servers and smaller maps. The good thing is that the MP it's pretty fun (if you make the game to work) and... you can't wallrun on every wall, there are like 1 like obvious wall to run and the rest are just like to practice parkour because there's really no need to use it, and most walls don't even work to do this you might end up using that a bit. Specialst are new to the franchise, you basically get to choose 1 specialist having each 1 a special ability that i think it's unlocked after a few minutes played, because it's not related to the scorestreak and a different character can be tuned to look a bit different, also you have the scorestreaks, weapon customization and everything that's already there, which leads me to the...  Zombies Mode: Perhaps this is the best part of this game, because it's really so crappy that there's actually nothing really good about it, Zombies mode feature something like an experiment or something where 4 ppl guilty of murdering someone are taken and placed somewhere when they are surrounded by zombies and you get this new ability to (pressing a button on a machine) turn out into something like the thing from The Darkness 2 for a breif period of time to ravage enemy zombies, the mode it's still pretty hard if played alone which encourages players to join with friends, it has a film noir ambient set in the 50s (but with new weapons) and the base game only includes 1 map (plus nuketown if you pre-order) Pretty fun but nothing really new.  Pros: * Great soundtrack, music it's really immersive * Great graphics (IF you have the powerful rig the game needs to run with them) * Decent story (i think...) * Fun MP * Somekind of new Zombies mode * Specialists  Cons: * Terrible port, poorly optimized * Fps drops constantly * Memory leak * CPU usages it's broken and consume the whole cpu * Stuttering utter and completly annoying to play happends every 3 or 4 seconds * Slowdowns on cinematics  My advice for you now is don't buy this game, was obviously focused on the releases of the consoles and it's a terrible pc port, as of it's now the game looks like an early alpha and i strongly suggest you wait until a sale or at least a few weeks or a month to wait for treyarch to adress the main issues with it.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"This game would have potential if the company behind it actually gave a ♥♥♥♥ about the game and not just about money.  The community is dead already on many gamemodes and I can't blame them. You'd think this game is still in beta if you played it, full of game breaking bugs and the hitboxes are worse than ever before. Whenever there is an update all they seem to do is add extra ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t content to the game where you can spend your money on. This company never gave a ♥♥♥♥ about the community and I guess they never will.  To sum it all up for you guys: - bad hitboxes at times (more than previous cod games) - laggy at times (framedrops) - buggy (random disconnects and graphical issues for many players) - updates are more about extra money generating content than actually fixing the game - small community (every game I play I see at least 4 people I know) - majority of the community are just a bunch of raging kids (same as at least the last 5 games) - needs a high-end system and still runs like ♥♥♥♥ if you have one (results vary though) - they didn't balance the weapons properly (shotguns and thermal dingo kids all over the place) - Activision sometimes permabans people that never cheated in this game and never say why - The DLC maps are only playable in limited gamemodes without the ability to play original maps + they actually seem to ban cheaters if you send evidence to the right place + the gameplay is fun (if you actually find a lobby or get to play without issues or dingo kids) + cool weapon, emblem and character customization options  Black Ops II was the last proper game they made and times like Modern Warfare 1 and 2 are long gone. The game reminds me more of cybermonkeys in space than the oldschool Call of Duty games.   The only reason I still play this is because of my clan and the fact that BOII has almost no players at all. I'm praying to god that the upcoming remake of MW1 will be decent or else this game will be the last of my 6000+ hour cod journey.",-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Context: I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, though I skipped Advanced Warfare for lack of a platform to play it on, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark. So, when I built my own PC I couldn't really resist the chance to play another Treyarch Zombies experience. So, here's a little on the game modes. My lack of experience with Advanced Warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options, bear that in mind.  Campaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.   You're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of 'Chase Paul Taylor around the world' and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the 'new' movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just 'Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time' Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customisation to add this illusion of content, when it's easier to just use the preset loadouts for each level.  A boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non existant. I hope they finally ditch this future ♥♥♥♥, it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.  Zombies: I played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good. The whole easter egg thing was nice at first, giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras, like maybe all the perks on the map, but this is ♥♥♥♥ing absurd. You have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features, and it's just a huge chore, honestly. You pretty much have to do it as well, unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15. Once again, they compromised level design in favour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly complicated story ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the bland cast of literal whos voiced by expensive actors, throwing back to Call and Mob of the Dead, but I never liked those ones anyway. Kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own The Giant, which is still the best map, or unless you bought the season pass.  It's pulled an Assassins Creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it, I've lost track of everything at this point. The worst part, as mentioned, is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts. Shadows of Evil is boring to play, tedious and poorly designed. I haven't played a map as bad as this since Shangri-La.   The Giant, a reskin of Der Reise, still stands the test of time, however. The new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous, and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point. The map has not changed whatsoever, besides randomisation of perk locations and a few small easter eggs (That don't take forever to do!) The mechanic of Pack-A-Punching your weapon twice was introduced in the first Black Ops and added generic attatchments to your weapon, but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns, allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an AOE, for example. Finally, the Gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the Pack a Punch in the original Der Reise. A fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable. Extremely powerful ones, such as spawning an ammo box on command, are gated behind a drop system, which reeks of a microtransaction system that was probably removed at the last second. As usual, I'll be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement, but if you're going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern Zombies, then you'll be disappointed.  Multiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. I'll stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game.  In terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby 'If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!' which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of colour, which sorely disappointed me.  However, as usual Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what ♥♥♥♥ like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel 'worth it' in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.  Conclusion: If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the *complete* lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC playerbase and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. And I enjoyed Ghosts. In its current state, I find it hard to reccomend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that 'Call of Duty is always the same' but this is no more obvious than in this installment. Feels like a mediocre side-grade of Advanced Warfare.   If you're reading reviews for a COD game, you're not the primary market. Don't buy this.  Also, do me a favour and don't comment below, my inbox is filling and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what you have to say.",-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"It is quite late for me to be making a review for this game, but better late than never.  Black Ops III is a very solid Call of Duty game. The best one yet in recent years, if I do say so myself. Content-wise, this game has enough stuff to keep you busy for a long, long time. And I'm going to tell you why:  1. CAMPAIGN: True to Treyarch fashion, the campaign is a complete mind♥♥♥♥. You thought you understood it, but then BOOM! It hits you with a plot twist so deep, M. Night Shyamalan couldn't even comprehend. The amount of lore and detail that went into this game is unbelievable by COD standards. That said, the campaign doesn't come without flaws. The story and characters have some poor design, with a lot of characters that you are supposed to care for, yet the game didn't attempt to make you feel it and just assume you do. You feel disconnected at times from the story, even though that's probably a good thing as you're supposed to be (I can't say any further because that will spoil the story). The campaign doesn't feature a lot of familiar actors, but going along with more cult favorites such as Christopher Meloni, Katee Sackhoff and Ben Browder, who maybe more familiar to those who are fans of series like Law and Order, Battlestar Galactica and Stargate SG-1. For the most parts, the actors did a good job in their portrayal of the characters, which is to be expected. My only concern is the lack of identity for the Player character, which, again, fits with the plot that Treyarch is trying to portray. But a last name like 'Mason' would've sufficed.  Gameplay-wise, this is the most in-depth COD campaign yet, with full level progression for your character, guns and equipment, with a variety of unlocks. To truly acquire 100% completion in this campaign can take you a serious amount of time. But it's worth every single second for those who love a good challenge. And you can even play the campaign co-op with up to 4 players, so the experience is even more fun.  2. MULTIPLAYER: If you love Black Ops II MP, and you love advanced movements, you'll love Black Ops III MP. The chain-based movement system made by Treyarch is very fluid and easy to master, in comparison to the Exo system provided by Sledgehammer Games in Advanced Warfare. Players have better control of the movement, which makes for a more relaxing experience (in theory). The Specialists are a very nice addition, though unbalanced at times for the game. It's very surprising to see Treyarch build an entire lore and backstories for each Specialist, giving them their own identity rather than Random Soldier #76 (winkwink).  But of course, this game is also the start of the money-making train called 'COD Points'. By now, you should probably know about this microtransaction currency, which you use to buy supply drops in-game to open for a chance of good loot. It doesn't sound too bad, until they start adding weapons into the loot pool. Pretty much every new gun and melee weapon are locked behind supply drops. So if you're unlucky, you may never see a new weapon in your time of playing this game. However, don't be too discouraged, as the game does have a Contract challenge that will provide you with supply drops that guarantee at least one gun and one melee weapon (and one more for each when you buy the season pass).  The DLC maps are also well done, with old maps being remade to fit the movement system. Definitely worth picking up the season pass for. As of now, the DLC maps are sadly only in TDM, but I hope in the future Treyarch will compose a Moshpit playlist for all objective modes, so that season pass owners can play objective modes on the DLC maps.  3. ZOMBIES: The heart of Treyarch's games, Zombies is even more in-depth than ever before. The story is given way more attention this year, with cinematic moments that you'd only dream of in the campaign, while retaining the mystery and crypticness of Treyarch all around it. It was such a pleasure to see how Zombies developed from a simple survival game mode to the complex, easter egg-centric, cinematic mode that it is today. It was also pleasant to see the return of the favorite quartet of Zombies, the Original 4. as the main characters, kicking ♥♥♥ and saving the world. However, it does irk me that the game isn't as Zombie-focused as it should be. With the introduction of mythical forces in the story, the zombies become less and less important as the story progresses. It's not entirely a bad thing, but it can have a negative effect on the state of the story as a whole, a gamemode where originally zombies only existed due to a mysterious alien element.  Gameplay-wise, Zombies in Black Ops III provides a lot of variety, with special abilities called Gobblegums that you can use, as well as full weapon progression system. The maps are also well designed, as are the sidequests. That is, until the last two maps where the sidequests become random as all Hell. But all in all, it was a fun, exciting and epic journey. Even though the finale to the 8-year saga could've ended on a better note, it was satisfying for me. And I await to see what Treyarch cooks up in 2018.  4. PC VERSION: Despite what you may have heard, Black Ops III is actually quite optimized on PC. It's just a bit more demanding than other COD games, even Infinite Warfare, due to some design decisions. As with previous titles, Treyarch pays a lot of attention in giving PC gamers a good experience while not straying too far from the console experience. Though there are certain things I don't necessarily agree with on their work (like completely separating PC balancing from console), BO3 is still a solid PC game that deserves to be played. As of the time this review goes live, mod tools have already been out for over a month, and the community has published a lot of great content. If you loved custom Zombies in World at War, you'll love custom Zombies in BO3.  Overall, Treyarch didn't disappoint me with BO3. It was everything I expected it to be, and more. Did it come up short at certain parts? Yes. But the goods outweigh the bads for me. Black Ops III will remain one of my top 5 favorite COD games in a long time.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"No spoiler in this review.  The latest episode in Call of Duty franchise. Continuing the story from WAW, BO1 and BO2. The time is setting in the future, 2065. All the sci-fi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality. Generally, the main menu is fabulous. You may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds. And you can locally play with friends in split-screen! (Support both vertical or horizontal split) This is very cool if you want to play together locally.  The game breaks into 3 big modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. In BO3, all these modes are quite decent individually. Moreover, all 3 modes are well connected. Such as, in Multiplayer mode, you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in Campaign mode. Most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes. And in each mode you have your own progress. They all have levels, achievements and statistics separately. Besides, all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends! Campaign and Zombies mode both support COOP up to 4 players.  Another awesome part is the customizations and the media community. Most of the FPS game (such as Battlefield series) allow players to decorate their guns with camo. And also have custom Emblems for creative players to show themselves. In BO3, each custom Emblem support up to 64 layers. Which means you could create almost anything you want. Furthermore, you may also fully customize your weapons with 'Camo' and 'Paint Job', even 'Clan Tag' or 'Kill Counter' if you got prestige. These customizations are not only for you to please yourself. You can upload your sick guns the to in-game media community. All the BO3 players could see your works and rate them, even download them if they like it. So the customization and social functionality is quite robust in BO3. (Screenshots sharing coming soon)  In order to clearly express my opinion, I will review BO3 mode by mode.   Campaign",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"  Okay.. I've put this review off for a while now, I think now that I have the time it's probably worth me writing one!  I'll try make it short, sweet and straight to the point.   Call of Duty Black Ops 3 is a 50/50 game in my opinion - the 'mixed' reviews show that too. It has its pros and it has its cons, however something is always drawing me back to this game, whether it's the frantic multiplayer or the captivating campaign. (but then again it's made by Activision, most of their games follow that path).   I'll start with the cons. (Get the negativity out the way).   The community.  Yeah, you probably already knew about that. The 'CoD' community is freaking awful, that ruins it in my opinion. It might not be everyone who is like that, but I can assure you that at least 2 people in any match will be 'salty' or 'toxic' about something at some point. It's hard to avoid, and if you find a nice lobby, stay in it! Of course this is only on the multiplayer part of it, not so much in zombies just the game-modes.     The system requirements.  This game is reliant on FPS. You'll probably see a tonne of reviews with these mentioned, or people complaining that it doesn't run or load or work or their FPS is -10. It does require a hell of a lot for it to be smooth with high FPS, or you can sacrifice all of the beauty in the game a very 'smooth' look and some FPS. It's a shame that this game requires so much for it to be look good and be +60fps, because I enjoy the surroundings in game as well as the graphics - but that's a personal preference. In a shooter game you need the speed, you need good 'fps' so you have an advantage over your enemies and Bo3 really does rely on that in certain situations, like when you're shooting down a giant spider like mech and you have to skid out the way of a missile heading straight towards you, or when you're head to head against others in a death match! However for some people FPS will be minimum and therefore your gameplay will be very different to someone with a strong PC. (Keep reading for a major fps fix)    The seriousness of it. (Or lack of it).  Personally I don't mind the lack of seriousness in the multiplayer, and what I mean by seriousness is, if you were to play some of Activision's older games you'd see a verrrry clear difference between this of Bo3 or CoD Ghosts for example. Black ops 3 is a rather futuristic take on the Bo3 franchise, more so than the other 2. Seriousness ceases to exist in multiplayer now that character customisation and 'highlight taunts' have gone out the window. You'd know what I mean if you saw it. Basically if you're looking for a ominous and stealthy multiplayer where you're crawling through mud and ash to get to the objective, it definitely is not this. Try Battlefield 1 instead. Because I know for a fact that if you score the most by the end of the game on BF1, your character doesn't dab, or do the whip &amp; naynay or does some other form of viral something. ( Bo3 is full of memes.)    The DLCs.  This is straight forward, just don't buy them if you want to play the new and different multiplayer maps online. They are dead. Like in most games where they release DLC only maps, no one is on them much.  However, if you want to play this game for the zombies, I'd say it's worth it! The DLC maps for zombies are rather enthralling and different. Also there's is a large amount of people playing on them!     The multiplayer scaling.  Yeaap. It's pretty crap. I don't need to explain how bad it can be, there's days where it will be perfect, there is a good mix of ranks and prestiges on both sides and you have a fair, fun game. Or, there's other days where you get put on the weak team and you get absolutely slaughtered, and you come out with a low 3kills/27deaths. That's never fun. Plus you can't always avoid it by leaving the lobby and joining a new one, cause there's a high chance you'll get put into a team with 3 vs 6, and the 6 are all max prestige, zooming around the map and obliterating everything.   Alright..  I think I covered most of what I think let's the game down a lot.  Now onto the pros!     The campaign! (I won't spoil anything don't worry). Personally I really enjoyed the campaign, it takes you on exciting and tiring missions, you're always in your feet or in the sky, doing something. The seriousness that lacks in multiplayer has to be somewhere! It's very immersive and emotional at times and during my play through I found myself getting attached to the different characters as well as my own. You're not a backseat brain™. (a/your character that you don't see, never hear but somehow they manage to save everyone and they rule the day.) You're play as a very proactive, strong, independent individual black op. I found that I was drawn to them, and you really take a front seat.  Also, the ability to customise yourself and your weapons is still there, not to mention finding collectibles hidden within each level will be scattered and placed in your room and over time your room will become a mini museum. - okay okay I like the campaign and I could keep rambling on but that's not fun..    ZOMBIESSS!  I haven't actually played zombies all that much, nor do I have any of the DLCs, I know others who have them and really enjoy them though.  But from what I've seen and experienced, I can tell you it was pretty damn fun! It's creepy, ominous, endless and noisy.  I'll be honest I haven't a clue how to solo it, so if you're interested in zombies more than anything else, I'd suggest watching some gameplay or look for a review about it. Zombies is a mode that is fun to play with friends or alone, one slip up or being in be wrong place at the wrong time could get you killed and eventually will! (3 hits and you're dead meat!) It's very different from other CoD Zombie modes that and it makes it unique in many ways! I also love the style of the default zombie map, it's like Bioshock mixed with zombies!     The atmosphere, music and graphics. I can keep this one short and sweet! (Kinda) All game-modes have a nice atmosphere to them, by that I mean there is a lot of detail that's been put into the maps, story lines and characters. It has a nice feel to it.  The music, well.. I love music in games! That's something I look for in games actually, but that's another personal preference, however all modes have their own music and it has been made to fit in, to work. Simply, it sounds great and it sets a scene indeed!   Now onto the graphics. If you read what I put above in cons, you know what I'm going to say. The graphics are amazing, then resolution is high and crisp, but. Yeah it's a big but.  You can run the game in 4K and it feels like you're actually in that shoot out, oooor you can run it in 1080p with acceptable fps and dream that your PC could handle 4K.  So, I'm going to tell all of you dreamers a little trick that a friend of mine told me when I was close to giving up on hope with my bad fps nightmare, all you have to do to achieve rather smooth gameplay and that advantage over others in multiplayer, is turn down the render resolution (under video in graphics) to anything under than what it's set at. - 60%, 50% etc  There's a cache, this makes your game look freaking awful, buuuut you can play like a pro.. soooo.. I guess it's 50/50  (Doing this and turning down the textures will improve your fps by around 20/30)  Okay, you know what, I'm going to bring this to a close, I typed all this on a phone and so far it's been like 2 hours or something, I can't remember anymore, I stopped noticing 50 words into typing this novel.. Yes this was 'short and sweet' to me.  Overall, I'll recommend this game, but it's more about what you're looking for in games!  Thankyou for reading my long freaking review that I've put off for a year!  I hope this helped you a bit, I apologise if it didn't! Goodluck! c:  ",1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I had such high hopes for this game. But with the obvious neglect of PC players, who wants to pay $60 to a money hungry company like Activision. Just opening the game you can see issues like Frame Stutters, Almost No Online Players, And The Fact It Takes 10 Minutes Some Times To Join A Server. They also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys. (And i will be honest i have put almost $40 into crypto keys) But I cant get over the fact that the servers are so bad. Less then 1 percent of players are on the DLC that i payed for really?!? And me and my friends have had such crazy issues with the NAT type and having a party for multiplayer. If you are absoulutely set on buying this game DO NOT BUY THE DLC! Honestly the worst money i have ever spent. Oh and one last thing prepare for the hardcore urge to rage you will get from all the broken guns and specialists. **(And this whole thing was all in my opinion and if you guys dissagree you either havent bought this for PC yet, Or you are just another blind Call Of Duty fan boy.)**   -Yours Sadly Josh",-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"First of all i am not saying that game is bad, if you are having fun with it, good, you deserve it.   So lets start my list: 1. Same thing over and over. I played some MP and feel like I am playing MW3, with some titanfall ripoff but with poor parkour. That is not what I should feel when I am playing NEW fps. Look at Rainbow Six Siege, it feels so fresh.  2. 50 usd season pass, which delivers........ Same old maps that old Call of duty games had. Renewed maps arent bad as we saw in Battlefield 4, however 50 usd Season Pass hase to be removed from game industry. For same reason I didnt buy Battlefront 2015.  3. Maps are limited. This game has jetpacks and 'parkour' however maps are limited and have 'invisible walls'. This is not acceptable in 2015, for a game that has modes bigger than 5v5.  4. Optimisation is great I suppose because it was running fine on my PC. However graphics feels outdated. As I mentioned I felt like I am playing MW3.  5. Easy to hack. During my playtime, I got 6 obvious cheaters out of 20 games. They were shoting thhrought the wall even when I was unreachable. (No they had no vision ability). Probably it is because engine is too old for now.  6. Ethics ? After Titanfall came out, CoD Devs are trying to make similar game, but why ? Titanfall was first one, and it is one of the best FPS of the decade. Have some respect to yourselves guys  So I could continue this list but I feel like no one is gonna read it then lol.  tl;dr ? Make something new for us. Concept is great, however it is poorly executed",-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Video Review:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpfhP2122EQ   Summary:   The game is a broken mess, I made a video on the day of release demonstrating the problems with the game. Since then the issues have no been fixed and I have found more. The Singleplayer is not only littered with performance problems but it's probably the worst entry to the franchise so far. Zombies Multiplayer matchmaking is extremely broken, Multiplayer is good, with some minor improvements over previous games. However, I live in Australia and am put in to lobbies with people in the US constantly which results in lag, teleporting players and overall leaves the game unplayable.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"BO3 is a game that needs your attention. They are trying to show you how PC ports of COD aren't all bad and that they're trying to work on it. Treyarch really does try and make good ports of COD, all leading up to BO3, in my book, have been well made ports.   With BO3, Treyarch is really stretching it. They're trying to make a new staple in PC CODs. With additions such as 2 player split-screen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year, this alone shows how serious they are with PC ports. Along side this we have full dedicated servers, an FOV slider that goes up to 120, a reasonable options menu, changable frame rates, and much more. They are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly. I haven't met a single hacker in any gamemode (as of writing this review).  BO3 didn't have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware. I didn't have any major problems during the launch but, after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up (compaired to the launch). As of writing this, I have no farther complaints to say about BO3 performance wise.  Now lets stop talking about the PC port and start talking about BO3 as a whole. BO3 adds many new features to the COD formula. Such as specalists and a more fluid movement system. A specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities. These abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time. This changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play. The new movement system isn't something to go to much in detail in, they mainly added wall running and sliding. This makes the game more fast paced and fun to play.  TL;DR Pros: - Split screen - Specalists - Alot of features for a PC port - New movement system  Cons: - Some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware (this isn't as bad as before though)  Overall 8.5/10  REMEMBER, THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE ENJOYMENT I HAVE HAD WITH THE GAME.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Review of the singleplayer campaign (not interested in multiplayer):  I have to say, I am honestly surprised. In a good way. The Black Ops 3 campaign is way longer than what we are used to in this franchise. I think it took me about 12 hours, which is a good length for a shooter, even by normal standards - but especially compared to other Call of Duty games.  The story was pretty boring in the beginning. But it got better and better, to the point where I was honestly interested in how it all would play out. The acting was pretty good (real actors, digitalized). And the ending - well, the ending was great. It left me sitting in front of my monitor and wondering what the hell just happened. I ended up reading explanations and theories about the story for another 20 minutes. It is a surprisingly complex story for this kind of action game. Not quite on the same level as Bioshock Infinite or To the Moon, but way above your usual CoD story. I have to say, I really liked it (despite the boring start).  The gameplay is CoD standard. Nothing special here. You have some abilities to unlock and upgrade. But I rarely used them. You have a wall-run, but only a few opportunities to use it in the levels. It felt unnecessary. And that was a shame, because it's a cool mechanic and should have been integrated better in the level design. Most of your enemies are the typical noname soldiers. There are also certain types of mechs. Some are soldier-like, and a few bigger ones, which require the use of a rocket launcher. So there is some variety here, but in the end it is typical CoD shooter gameplay. Which is not brilliant, but alright.  The graphics are ok. The game looks quite good sometimes, but overall dated. They really make the most out of the old engine. But the game cannot compete with modern titles like Battlefront or Witcher 3.  If you want a number - I guess I would give it a 7.5/10 for the campaign. And it could have been more, had they improved the gameplay a little more. I really didn't think it would be that good.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"This game was made for console and, with their actions, Treyarch makes it very clear that they don't care about PC players. Unless you buy it for zombies or graphics, this is a complete waste of money.",-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I wanted to take the time and explain all of the content on the game so buyers can make an informed purchase. As many know since there are 3 different makers of the game the gameplay and content can change drastically between them. This game is made by Treyarc. If you do not follow them they are the original creators of zombies and often regarded as the best of the three. Now for the review.  Campaign: The campaign allows for 4 different difficulties ranging from beginner to holy sh**. The game allows for multiplayer campaign which is a huge plus and a lacking feature from the years previous which I really enjoy. The graphics are what you would expect from such a large franchise so I won't go into detail there. In the game you are outfitted with a chip in your brain which allows you to interpret various things very quickly and also give you advantages such as hacking robots and or causing them to self destruct. The overall gameplay is not the best seen in the years of call of duty but it is well made. Smooth frame rates provide a really good experience overall. The game doesn't allow you to skip cut scenes and many are pretty long. I particularly like following the story however this could get old for some. One the campaign is complete it opens a new mode which is a zombie story mode. I personally am really excited about this however due to the long story mode and attempting it on realistic I have not made it that far yet. I will update my review when I reach that area of the game.  EDIT: The cut scenes are in fact skip-able and when playing a mission on realistic it is best to play with friends. Even when with friends a single mission will take on the order of 1-2 hours depending on the mission. The zombie story mode is a lot of fun and depending on the difficulty you select can be very very challenging. At the beginning of a level there will be a mystery box. It's actually very well done in how they incorporate random things that have become a staple in the zombie mode. I was anxious to reach the zombie story mode, but was a bit reserved in thinking it might not be laid out very well. It is in fact is even more fun than the main story line in my opinion. I wont include any spoilers for those who haven't played either story line, but the game play is amazing.  Multiplayer: The multiplayer is standard call of duty but has the addition of a super power and wall running. I particularly don't care for the wall running or double jump and all that fancy stuff but if it must be added to the game then it is much better than the Exo suit from last years call of duty. The map designs are really nice for multiplayer and the overall game play feels very balanced depending on play style.  EDIT: I have actually come to enjoy the wall running mechanics unlike previously stated. It takes some getting use to but once you jump on a wall to begin wall running go ahead and aim down the sights and its a good method the sneak over to a player and get the kill before he realizes where you are. The 'super' powers that you can select from are a very nice touch. While some are way more useful than others I personally prefer the annihilator. Its a one shot one kill pistol and if you are an accurate shot then this is a must try. It is very effective and impossible to defend if you are accurate. Miss a shot however and the very slow reload will most likely render you dead.  Zombies: Disclaimer...I love zombies. The first and only map of black ops 3 is amazing. It's a huge map with many things to explore. In place of dogs however there are these bat like creatures that come every 5 rounds or so. Also as you increase in rounds a octopus like boss arrives and will chase you. He really isn't a big deal...easy to kill but more and more of these boss like creatures will begin to spawn each round. There are a few new additions such as gum balls and a new perk. I won't explain every detail but if you are a fan of zombies then you will enjoy the new map. Make sure to google how to find the perks as there are busted bottles that will explain the best direction to travel towards to get the desired perk. In order to turn on power etc you will need to become the 'beast' which is ok I guess. It's new and different but not sure how I feel about it yet. I will say this though it's much better than the bus map that black ops 2 came with. Good luck Easter egg hunting!!!! I will add that if you are playing with a group of 4 I have found a very good strategy that will allow you to reach the higher rounds and each have their own circle. Once you open pack a punch room one player stays in there while another is just outside pack a punch while remaining in the rift. As long as you have opened all the rifts the other 2 players can simultaneously run the boxing ring circle. This will allow one to face forward and clear the path while the other is opening fire to clear the zombies chasing you.  Ok so that's a quick rundown of the changes and what to expect. Please do not downvote cause you are a fanboy or hate the game and do not agree with what I said. I am attempting to inform buyers of the changes and what to expect. Although some is my opinion of course I tried to give an honest review with no bias.  Update 03/10/16: So I have had a lot of time playing the game now and have unlocked everything that you can. Basically for the price of the game you are getting 2 full length story modes (Normal and zombie), the standard call of duty multiplayer with the addition of powers and wall running, and a massive zombie map that offers a ton of replayablility. Honestly Treyarc killed it with this game. although its not perfect since there are still glitches such as the game randomly freezing causing you to start a 2 hour mission over as well as a few other annoyances I highly highly recommend this game to those that are on the fence. IMO this is the best multiplayer experience to come from the Call of Duty franchise in a long time.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"After 175 hours, i'm sad to tell that i can't recommend this game.... Poor optimization, lag, and the fact that except TDM and DOM nothing else is played doesn't help.... Free run or parkour you can do on 10% of the maps, so they are practicaly useless, and then the main feature is double jump... Weapon balance is non existent, i will quote my friend who told me 'that Treyarch used logic that if nothing is balanced then everything is balanced' and the list goes on.....

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"My thought about this game  Campaign mode -utterly tasteless playing alone; playing with others doesn't help much since the story is air-thin -frame rates drops frequently -random disconnection -good luck find anyone to play with in public game  Nightmare mode -a God of War rip off, plot-wise. You are aided by a female demigod to kill her demigod-brother, sounds familiar? :3 -may be this is how they compensate the blend main story, they add zombies and a lots of dialogs between your character and two other 'voices'.  Zombie mode -Ohh, it's colorful, but... -... there aren't many things that can make you feeling 'wow, this is brand new!' -random disconnection, crashes -need less luck to find someone to play with  Multiplayer mode -random disconnection, crashes -familiar game play -good chances to find a game in certain game modes.  So, all in all. NOT recommended. But if you are not short on money, go right ahead, get a taste of how far COD has fallen ;)",-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I don't completely understand all of the negative reviews on this one. This is the first CoD game I've ever actually owned myself. It's no masterpiece of gaming, but it's fun and the controls are solid. For all of the reviews that are upset about the poor optimization, I understand. If you can't even play a game properly due to technical issues, it can be pretty frustrating. But the game itself is pretty fun. Zombie mode is fun, but weirdly complicated. Something that would be enjoyable to figure out with friends. The multiplayer is standard CoD fare. You should know by now if that's your cup of tea. Campaign is fairly enjoyable. I do recommend this game, but it kind of depends on what you are looking for in a game. If you really just want to shoot people in a game with well done fluid controls, this game is great. The new cyber-soldier type abilities are interesting and fun. If you like CoD, get it. If you don't, don't.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I swear they pay people to write a positive comment about this game, and pay more people to up vote and pay yet more people to down vote all the negative ones. But trust me this review is worth a read.  I’ve played a few Call of Duty games in my time and it seems to get worse with each one since Modern Warfare 2, with Black ops 1 being the last “good” call of duty. But when you play this you'll want to play one of the older call of duties where the people are actually on the GROUND.  It is no longer “realistic” but they’ve moved to the theme of being “futuristic” – which doesn’t give the same appeal.  I want to like this game, and I don’t want to. The bad reputation of a call of duty doesn’t want me to like this game, but because my friends play it I want to like it so that I can play with them. No matter how hard I try I cannot recommend this game. My Friends like it for the nostalgia that I simply don’t have with this game. They would buy the game just for the Zombies, where I see the main aspect of the game being at multiplayer.  So why would you get this game if Call of Duty is the same game over and over again? If you’re buying it for the Zombies, get Black ops 1 and the DLC if you’re that committed.  As always it is also a bad PC port, your PC can be 2X more powerful than one of the consoles yet, you’ll equal its performance. Of course the performance is getting better with each update but still, after downloading 24GB+ of the game, surely there would be performance problems already solved in that data somewhere.  (I have only watched the campaign on youtube). The campaign it washed up and could have been thought up by someone who has only played 1 call of duty, and it also seems they wrote the campaign on the back of a napkin with a crayon.  The dedicated servers seem to be more dedicated to the consoles. It’s as if they want the PC users to suffer.  They try to shove more DLC down your throat as you only get 1 map on zombies. Multiplayer maps are very small, so you aren’t bored – yet the maps are boring as they are not adapted to the movement mechanics of the game. There are also a lot of balance issues with weapons, if you play the game you’ll find out what is OP soon enough. If you don’t want to be disappointed even more don’t play the campaign, you won’t care or remember any/many characters – the voice acting on them is poor and if you want to play it multiplayer – it sucks even further as it obviously wasn’t configured for multiplayer campaign.  This game is definitely not with its major price tag, if you want a Call of Duty, buy a cheaper one. If you REALLY want this game, but it from an external website like '♥♥♥♥.co m ' or CDkeys. If you want a shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will be a lot better for you but it might take some time getting used to.  WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME:  At least it still has guns in it… at least… most of the weapons are… Clicking the “Uninstall” button",-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Same ♥♥♥♥, different smell. Black Ops III does nothing to improve the series formula, it adds nothing new to the shooting genre or gaming in general. It has a somewhat solid campaign but the storyline is muddled and the players abilities aren't implemented all that well. Expect to finish it in 6 or 7 hours and don't expect it to leave any kind of impact on you.  If you're going to sink 50+ hours into the multiplayer and have a bunch of friends to play with, then there is a bit of value here. The new zombie mode seems fun too but at the time of writing this review, the matchmaking is having issues and finding a game is tricky.  This is hardly the worst COD game ever made, it does have a fair bit of content but it sure is far from the best. Most people will already have made their minds up about this one anyway.

In this day in age what do i need to be concerned about. You charge premium prices and put out subpar products honestly WTF!!,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"In its current state, I would not recommend this game. This game is plagued with issues right now, as I'm sure you've heard.  There is frequent stuttering/fps drop. Gameplay stutters, loading screen stutters, cutscene stutters; everything. Sometimes it's really weirdly timed, too. You can have a shootout with weather effects and explosions everywhere and the FPS will be fine; go into a small room and suddenly it all just drops. I tweaked the setting here and there and it's improved things somewhat - gameplay improved, cutscnes didn't. It's mostly a mixture of low - medium, with some of that resolution upscaling this game has. Jesus Christ, it made the game look real ♥♥♥♥ing ugly.  Multiplayer is as chaotic as ever. Whoever shoots first wins. If you still dig that in these games, go right the ♥♥♥♥ ahead; if not, you might wanna skip this. I haven't really seen examples of some of these 'Specialist Classes' being more OP than other classes. Mind you, I'm awful at the game so I'm not the best person to judge. The maps don't really seem that memorable. Just run here and shoot that. Less campers than other entries, so that's good I guess.  The whole updated mobility in this game kinda seems like a cheap gimmick to me. Most of the time it just seems to be more effective and quick to just point and shoot like a traditional CoD game than it is to run all over the walls and ♥♥♥♥. I would try performing jumps/wall runs in some spots that look really good for those movements, only to find an invisble wall blocking me and sending me to my death. It doesn't seem like mobility is actually encouraged, to be honest.   I did find one design choice very irritating. The fact that the campaign is sorta like...split into 2 clones - one for SP and one for MP, with progression in one mode not having an effect on the other. This really bugged me because the game defaults to the online campaign (I nearly lost connection to my own campaign level somehow). When I went to play offline, I discovered I had to start over, so didn't bother with that. Oh, yeah. I can't seem to find a way to play Zombies offline.  It's not just the game which stutters, it slows my whole computer down. It takes a few seconds to close down when I quit out and then turns my PC into a potato for a couple minutes. This has never happened to me with any other game; Witcher 3, MGSV, Fallout 4 - nothing.  Update:  OK, the campaign....Unless you have friends, it's just boring and tedious. Because it's built for co-op, enemies are just eveeeryyywheeeerrrre. It makes everything crawl along at a snail's pace as you try to kill dozens of enemies in a single area to progress. At the end of all levels after the first, your kill count will just be in the hundreds. It really doesn't help with this one section section with never ending waves of re-spawning enemies. Good ♥♥♥♥ing God. Beyond the gameplay, the plot kind've falls ♥♥♥♥ over ♥♥♥♥. The concept is interesting but it often falls flat because of how it can sometimes heavily rely on the relationships between these, dull, boring, uninteresting unexplored characters. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue and voice acting is just full of cringe. There's also this stupid, cheap twist but I can't comment on that more without spoiling it. Sorry.  Update 2: OK, Zombies is alright. As usual, it's a party orientated game, so the best experience is with friends. The new map is...interesting. It has a great look to it there there are some cool new enemies. However, it's expansiveness is a bit of a double-edged sword. Granted, there's more to do, but there's also too much to do, if you catch my drift. It takes bloody adges to get around everywhere and this can become tedious after multiple attempts on the same map. However, there are couple different environments within this map to spice things up. There's also a new 'bubblegum' perk system which the player can customise, which is a welcome addition. All in all, pretty cool. Just bring mates; especially considering the time it can take to find an online lobby sometimes.  So yeah....give it a couple months to be patched some more.",-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Yes, there were some Day 1 performace issues. That is why there are so many negative reviews out of the gate.  So lets get real! A patch was released and now the game runs like butter! Smooth 60FPS the entire time! Don't judge a game based on knee-jerk reactions to a 12 hour hickup that was resolved. You can have 10 years to prep for something, and when the time finally comes... Ya, there is always that chance something could go wrong. It happens, especially in the game development. They responded quickly and we are having fun now! HUZZAH!  I'm not saying that it is OK to launch a broken game, but the game was not entirely broken. Please make sure you update your graphics driver (there was a new driver release for nvidia cards to help with the game), and make sure you are running at reasonable settings for your rig. If you are still having issues, PLEASE! Let them know via their support channels (twitter, email, etc).   Is the game a perfect 10/10 -- Hell no! But it is fun! The last CoD I enjoyed was Modern Warfare 2 and this is insanely fun for me! Multiplayer is a blast! Story (although short) was entertaining!  Would I recommend this game, absolutely!",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,It was hard enough surviving alone. Now I just have a person raiding my fridge every day.,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.    When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.  Starting off: Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless  Survival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.  Wilderness: When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.  Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a 'Jury-Rigged Portal' And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the 'Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart' You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)  Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).  Characters -  Wilson:  Pros -  Grows a beard  Cons - None.  Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.  Willow:  Pros -  Doesn't Take fire damage Starts with a lighter (Infinte torch)  Cons -  When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires Can Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.  Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.  Wolfgang:  Pros -  Gets stronger on a full stomach Has more hp  Cons -   1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach Moves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach Loses more sanity in Night / Afternoon  Ah, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only 'Power up' to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.  Wendy:  Pros -  Has a ghost sister Doesn't lose much sanity in dark  Cons -  Does -.25% Less damage than all characters Loses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in  Wendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.  WX78:  Pros -   Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled / Stale and take no penalty. Can be charged by lightning Can eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.  Cons -  Takes Damage in the rain Starts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)  WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.  Wickerbottom:  Pro -  Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked. Able to craft her own books Starts off with 2 Papyrus.  Cons -  Can't Sleep Takes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food  Wickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.  The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.  Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.  EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY. PLEASE STOP ADDING ME",1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,As me being not a fan of single player games I decided to pick this game up with a friend. So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.  The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.  As for the multiplayer performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now.   If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.  Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently. I really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features. Really pumped to give the 'A New Reign: Part 2' Update a try tonight.,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"  Sometimes, we choose games based on a variety of criteria: the preferred genre, sensory engagement, friends' recommendations. We read reviews, compare walkthrough videos, look for replayability value. Curators, Steam sales, Humble Bundle - it all paints a rather complex picture of what we do before making our mind.  And sometimes, games choose us.   I have never been a person favouring survival games. I have never touched multiplayer before. My approach to games is that of a narratologist: I see them as stories. Thus, I am naturally better-disposed towards examples rich in narrative, possibly less flexibility in shaping the plot, but a fully-fleshed character and loving mythopoeia. I do not need other people to enjoy the action of a BioWare RPG or the king of first person sneakers like Thief. These are as wonderful on their own.  I received DST as a gift from my friend. With no practical experience in multiplayer games, I took the plunge due to her own magnificent person. And on the colourful crusade against death of bees and pengulls (my typical bane at the time), I caught the bug going by the game's name. Beginning to host myself, with the ability to create more hostile maps through the careful use of prefab presets and lore-friendly mods, then starting a group to coordinate our sessions and joining the Klei forums came naturally, with little to no realisation on my side. And finally, with a group of similarly-minded regulars in love with the written word, we took our TDE wilderness adventure into the game for the added challenge of survival while storytelling.   On the doorstep of my first anniversary of setting foot outside the familiar glowing portal, I am honoured to highlight the impressive replay value of DST. With plenty of detailed reviews dealing with the intricacies of the game, I would rather focus on the bigger picture. DST is one of the rare games growing with you. You start as a rather hapless freshman in a world of wacky science, grim-sweet humour and dangers galore. You learn the importance of bearing a light as darkness approaches, remembering your fragile sanity and crafting items whose recipes are often amusingly bereft of sense (whoever thought wearing a fantasy elephant's trunk as a vest would be a good idea, I applaud you). Topmost, you die. Often. In very endearing ways. But you (hopefully) learn from your mistakes and with time find yourself successfully facing the most daunting of threats.   At some point, you feel you have beaten the game. You have at least one big camp spreading across the horizon, parade in thulecite gear and fry giants with magical staves. But this is the point where it is all starting: you seek new ways to challenge yourself. You tinker with worldgen options ('Let's set hound mounds to lots!'). You browse the workshop for mods (where Sturgeon's Law is as accurate as ever, yet still worth the risk for the elusive 10% of gems). You try out new characters, new strategies, new maps. You come up with your own challenges beyond Lights Out. You are prone to becoming the member of the community whose lair is the forums and secular cult: the hallowed Potato Cup. Maybe you actually start GM-ing a wilderness adventure to expand the elegantly unobtrusive plot.  Finally, you likely realise the human aspect of Don't Starve  Together  in comparison to the impressive singleplayer. It is more fun, more engaging, more threatening, even, to die in company. Which, naturally, is many-faced, since the people you meet on public servers are as likely to make a griefer coming-out as become acquaintances, game buddies, friends. DST, while with many differences to its predecessor Don't Starve, can be played alone, with no player slots open or a password. But most people, yours truly included, find soloing with no other transients around rather upsetting after a longer while. Your character may be thriving on their own, but your own mind will keep processing the eerie solitude of this fascinating world.   Disclaimer: my game copy was a gift. Since then, I have been picking DST as a go-to present. Another friend of mine is scheduled to receive her own for Christmas. The bug is very virulent.",1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,"I am just a new player. So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...  If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).  Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Day 1: me and my friend spawn and say, this is going to be easy. We find a nice spot and we settle down...... Day 2: After making a science machine my friend runs into a WARG! and we run from our home. Day 3:We were nomads feeding off the land and hunting small critters, we lost our home and was trying to find a new one. Day 4: My friend found civilization! A pig village. The villagers greet us, and we trade suppies for gold and decide this is our new home.P.S the Warg did come back but he got butaly murdered by and army of pigs... We ate well that night. Day 5: We build walls and another science machine and build farms to help us survive. Day 6: My friend was like, 'look what i found'! it was a cave and we prepared our stuff to exlpore this cave. Day 7:After waking up from sleep we went inside the cave.. There was TONS of loot and i thought 'boy we are rich'! Day 8: We built a cave base with some underground trees, grasses , etc. After that we built some lanterns and went to explore deeper. Day 9: The Horrer! While my Friend was slpunking with me an army of RABBIT MEN attcked us! And i was like Holy ♥♥♥♥! they skinned my friend alive and proceded to gnaw me to death next! As i ran my lantern was running out of power! Then i saw a light of Hope!! an entrance to land above! I climbed the rope to the surface and then revived my friend with a telltale heart.Only prob we were in a rocky WASTELAND......

322330,Don't Starve Together,"  Don't Starve Together is an artistic, charming, extremely challenging, at times downright brutal multiplayer survival game. Ultimately, it is one that will mostly likely take modifications for many to find playable, or at least enjoyable ~ When they say 'uncompromising', that is the truth. This game might make you pull your hair out, so be aware.  Three of four seasons will kill you without protection. Giant monsters will hunt you down and destroy everything you have. Almost every living thing will also kill you. Food is scarce and will take dedication to maintain. Shelter is temporary and extremely precious. Your food will spoil. Your sanity will disintegrate (literally, you have to keep your Sanity meter up). Your storage is limited.  The art style of this game is creepy in a good way, reminiscent of Tim Burton's art style for example, and is very charming. The music, art, and how it is incorporated into the game is rather lovely. Due to the high difficulty of the game, even small achievements like making shelter or cooking food can feel unusually rewarding. I cannot say the game is bad, but I will say that it's possibly the most difficult survival game I've played. Be alert, be vigilant, and bring friends ~ and you just might not starve.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason.   If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed.   Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Don't starve together Review. Intro Don't starve together is a online game of don't starve written in LUA code developed by klei entertainment. As I have spent well over 580 hours playing the game, hosting dedicated servers, making mods, playing though-out early access and after release I will tell you what I think of the game that ate up most of my free time.  Pros 1 The game is stable, functional and works well just like don't starve does but only online. The game has a massively active fanbase and after I wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages I have been sent to help people on their server, to help get mods working and to join people in there server. The game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag, but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well. I have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me, running 20-40 mods with many people on a server.  2 The game is modable it runs on the same code as don't starve on LUA code so if you know how to read basic code, and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game. I have been able to make mods for don't starve and don't starve together although I only published them privately. The game is very easy to mod, hell even someone as ♥♥♥♥ at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made, crappy, interesting, fun and awful mods you can enjoy. You could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore, or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don't starve together workshop has.  3 The game is really fun I don't need to say that when I spent over 580 hours in the game do I? Well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content. The combat in the game I would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright. Cons  1 The game made me read and write code. I didn't need to and I didn't want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so I could log out of my own game then rejoin it when I came back. Then I learned stuff like how to write ini files, LUA, batch files, and other codey words I can't remember. That stuff isn't fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game. If you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff.  2 The game doesn't have local multiplayer its possible I even say a don't starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn't they add that into DST? Well I can think of why they didn't they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that's fine. It still sucks that I can't play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever.  WARNING this game is going to mess with you, first you join a few games then your like 'oh I liked this in this game but I didn't like this in, this game' then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse. Second, You will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30-80 mods you can enable or disable in your game. then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods, then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer, then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast, well and you will build a awesome base with other players, have lots of fun but then because PVP is off and the game is public, the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made. You can't kick the scum fast enough and you don't just want to kick them... No you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it. So then you turn PVP on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you. Then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies. Warning this game will change you.  Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, yeah its alright. ",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"One of my all time favourite Indie games out there.. There are so many reason why I absolutely adore this game, though here are some of 'em:   - Lovely art style and mechanics; seriously, this game is gorgeous  - Difficulty; yes you might be struggling in your first couple of runs, but eventually it all feels natural  - Handsome community; the wikia for this game is a wonderfull place to learn new stuff and chill out  - Spooky; yeah this game can be really scary at times, and the fact that you're voice chatting with someone makes is soo much fun!  - Skins and market support; !!!  - Randomly generated fun; this game might screw you over super hard if you give it a chance  - Alot of fun for couple of bucks; yes, if you get into this game you might spend hundreds of hours playing it, there is just so much to do!  - The developers seem to be a really friendly group of people, judging by the forums. They are really doing a very good job on improving this masterpiece even further  This game is definitely worth your and your friends money. Stop reading reviews and Hop right in!",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"  I really freaking love this game! A friend gave it to me a while ago as present and I never played it 'cause I had no idea, what it was about (I don't like playing games if I don't even know a little bit about it) one night we played it together and I freaking love it! I'm so obsessed with it.  I like that you don't actually need the Single Player Game 'Don't starve', you can also play all alone on your own server and even offline. It's quite challenging, it's pretty hard to keep health, hunger and sanity up and avoiding/fighting weird creatures, but it's so much fun though! And even more fun with friends. A must buy for people who like strange things and challenging survival games.   I really like the style of it, the sketchy grafics, the cute characters, the music and sound effects, this game is a masterpiece and worth every cent. You can do so much in this game, it never gets boring.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"When I first played Don't Starve, one thing that I kept thinking was - I wish I could share this with my friends... and finally, I can. The multiplayer experience is amazing - especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat. The Don't Starve world translates very nicely to co-operative play, but since I haven't tried PvP I can't comment on what that's like at all.   Out of the three friends I've played with, two ended up finding Don't Starve too stressful. Something about how there's too much to keep track on at once, and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work. In the game's defence, this was during early beta, and they weren't Don't Starve players to begin with, but I think there's something to it. Don't Starve demands that you're quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree. It can get pretty hectic and there's not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts. It's something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options.  Me, I feel like I've found the game for the very first time, all over again. The stuff I loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side. There's a bit lost in atmosphere because you're no longer so devastatingly ALONE, and things are less creepy... but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability. Today, for instance, I was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees. A well-planned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival.",1,1

The survival system is incredible addicting since you need to plan ahead what to do to survive in the next season. There are a lot of stuff to learn and you will die a lot at the beginning but fear not! Learn from your failure and do it better next time :)   Imo this game is incredible fun if you play it with friends or alone. Joining random servers is fun too but don't get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies. (Doesn't matter if you are online or not)  The developers are very passionate, shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you won't get bored easily :P  I highly recommend this game, even without sales it's worth the money!",1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Survival, crafting, dark scary nights and a social aspect of bringing your friends along for an adventure. You simply can't go wrong with a game like this. The artstyle is of incredible beauty and highly stylized, the soundtrack is very suitable for the game's setting and the effects round everything up.  As for the gameplay, it is not for a second shallow. When you start of you are in this intense rush to get enough materials and food to survive your first night. Klei brought this idea of dark and fearful nights back and really did a great job at delivering this frightening experience to the survivors. Especially when you're only just starting, the lack of knowledge and your cluelessness about what to do add a thrilling factor to the world of Don't Starve. Seasons, your sanity, the need for food and the want to build a home make for a very packed list of things to do in only ever so much time, as the days are flying past one after another.  The base game is already a lot of fun, but with the twist of playing with friends it is even more. The reviews speak for themselves and for the price, this is an incredible deal that you probably don't want to miss out on.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Very fun and addictive survival game where you can team up with your friends and try to survive in the wilderness against monsters, hunger, darkness and cold and keep yourself from losing your mind in the process.  Pros: + There is no perfect class. All classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another. All depends on your play-style what you want to go with. + I tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game I have seen none of those problems. + Plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred play-style. + The game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character. + Countless hours of fun with your friends  Cons: - There seems to be no way of tracking your friends. When you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location. I ran around for ages joining my friend's server trying to find him and his camp until I eventually died in the dark. Add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are. - The game could use a tutorial. If you only just started playing your only help is checking the key-bindings. - Public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders. (Even when the server clearly states it's Co-op).",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"so i have been playing DS (not many hours since i played offline a lot) and i have been playing a ♥♥♥♥ ton of DST  this game is amazing, so much content (the Reign of giants, New Reign, skins) everything is so great about this game this game teaches you about the value of team work, to go out with a bunch of strangers that you got no idea if will work with you or that you'll have to babysit them and make a camp  i did a lot and died to a lot of things (some cause of other people :P) but i met a lot of amazing people here as well, this game is amazing in how much love it gets from it Devs on Klei gaming, this game is 10/10  but most importantly!

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Day 14:  Myself and a few friends venture north to gather some much needed gears to grow our base. With my friend playing Wickerbottom recipes are a breeze and we establish a small dwelling of berry bushes, crockpots and a small birdcage. Things seem to be going well and we spend the rest of the day gathering food. One of my friends had died to an elephant so to stop his eccentric hauntings my other friend went about gathering the necessary tools to revive our fallen friend.   I however remain around camp tinkering with recipes and trying to raise my sanity to stable levels when i am attacked by shadows. Night immediately falls, with my only source of light being my trusty torch. I run around the wilderness trying to escape the shadows but it was for nought. With my torch dwindling i do the only thing i can, i set fire to a far off tree... how i would soon regret that decision.  The fire soon spread, hopping from tree to the next until finally it roasted the berry bushes, melted the crockpots and turned the birdcage to ashes. My friends arrive back at base to see everything is left in a smoldering pile of cinders with a lone ghost floating in shame.  10/10 would play again. Also has hats!",1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Don't Starve Together Review ------------------------------- This game is THE BEST. My rating: 5 STARS There is nothing wrong with this game. The new update is THE BEST! Caves, new characters, aaaarrrggghhhhh!!!!   EVERYONE WHO HASN'T BOUGHT IT SHOULD. ",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Overall still very fond of the game, both in the gaming experience sexual or somewhere else, very innovative style, but personally feel that the only downside is that the world is too monotonous, play to play, it was only the surface and underground if that part can beach DLC into the inside of it is very good.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Starting with collecting sticks and grass and then moving on to build your base, you can pretty much find anything you would expect to see in a survival game in Don't Starve. As it's very clear, the main objective is not to starve. You not only choose to cook what you want from the endless list of recipes, but also try to survive from bunch of evil creatures. Make your own farm and collect your vegetables, hunt down some animals and gather your meat and also create your own bee hives to gather some honey. Mix them all in a crock pot and Voila! You got yourself a delicious meal for dinner.  Even if the graphics don't look like so, the realistic ambient of the game is awesome. If you get closer to the fire pit, you will burn, you can build a fire going through all the forest and they turn into ashes and coal. If you get closer too much to the sea, the items you drop will fall and disappear. Standing right next to a tree will cover you a little bit from the rain. You know what? That's not all I can tell, you need to get the game and discover more.  Actually, survival in this realistic and somehow not realistic atmosphere is a lot fun, surviving together with your friends is even more fun. Everyone takes their roles and you can build your base faster than ever. If you die in this world, it's not the end of the world as long as anyone of your friends could stay alive, but you need to pay the price for it. It is harder to stay alive in this game if you have more friends. A dead body in the map cause all the remaining players to lose their minds. So, it's a lot more fun and also a lot more challenge. Don't just sit and play some boring games in your beautiful chair, try to don't starve!",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"So nice, i can easily pass the day playing. I buy like a two days ago and i'm addicted.  Pros: Nice variety of biomes, scenarios, situations. A master piece on sandbox. You will play for long hours to master some aspects on the game. Great work Klei, i'm a new fan.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,My explanation of the game:  Best friends at day 1  kills eachother at 15  10/10 would fight my friends again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,Easily my favorite survival game. When your sanity goes down it really make YOU feel like your going insane. I love how it plays with your mind.,1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,Tons of fun great with friends :) or without :(,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,This game is actually my spirit animal,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Remember when you first played Tetris and after a while buildings started to look like Tetris blocks and you were trying to fit them all together?   I left the house today after playing DST for 40 hours (for a week). It's winter here and all the real life twigs are calling to me to gather them. On my walk I actually heard the haunting screams of rabbits being murdered. Amid surfing the web, for a moment I mistakenly thought it was going to 'get dark'.  I am constantly hungry.   This is what it comes to.  Survival instincts resonated from not wanting to do stupid sh*t, like burn the base camp down in front of your mates will make you this way.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"First off, buy the game! Its $13 for 2 copies (at the moment)  Im 7 hours in (2 days in real life) and its been a blast. Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!  Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!   Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!  The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.  Recap:  Buy it!  10/10 would recommend to all my friends again.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,The only things scarier than starving... is finding a willow near your base,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"  So my former best friend gifted me this game out of the kindness of her heart, and boy was i excited to get to play this game~~! After being nearly 100 hours in this game i thought its best that i give it a review, so here it is! This is what a true survival game is all about - this is THE game that got me into this genre in the first place. I will say the game had a few minior annoying problems in the vanilla version; no way to find your team mates on the map if you go your own way finding resources, and a little hard to find food or other stuff you may need in default settings of the map sometimes.   But these can be easily fixed with workshop mods so theres really nothing bad to say about this game. To me this was a very refreshing and new game from the useal BOOM BOOM KILL EM' ALL types of games that i useally play. No zombies, gore, medieval stuff, dragons, nudity, or guns - just pure adventure fighting to stay alive. in real life i wouldnt last 1 day in the world of Dont starve togther...id miss my internet and stuffed crust pizza too much :3",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Review ENG/ITA  A supplement that extends the life of game. Multiplayer until 4 players and custom worlds, which can make your survival game more easy or hard. With default settings, mobs will inflict much more damage and they'll have much more health, in relation at the number of players in game. Futhermore the food consumption is directly proportional to the mouths to feed, micidial element at start game when you haven't an advanced base camp. Even if you're veteran this mode will test you. Therefore, you don't let your guard down.....  Supplemento al gioco principale che ne allunga, sicuramente, la giocabilità. Multiplayer fino a 4 giocatori e mondi personalizzabili possono rendere più facile o più difficile la sopravvivenza. Con le impostazioni di default i mob faranno più danno e avranno più vita, in relazione al numero di giocatori. Inoltre il consumo di cibo è direttamente proporzionale alle bocche da sfamare, elemento micidiale a inizio gioco quando manca un campo base sviluppato. Anche se siete veterani, questa modalità vi metterà a dura prova. Quindi non abbassate mai la guardia....  Vote/Voto : 8,5/10",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"This is by far my favorite survival game. The art style and game mechanics are what make it stand out to me and what make this game enjoyable and unique to me. Although im complete and utter crap at this game, it is extremely fun with friends. This game was gifted to me by a friend who got the Don't Starve bundle and we both have been getting a kick out of it. Our favorite thing to do so far is feed the Oinkers and collect their poop and collect poop in general. We have yet to figure out how to kill the Gobbler, but when we do...oh boy.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,  Mosquitos are equally annoying as in real life.  10/10 for realism. GOTY material for sure.,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Even in the beta Don't Starve was a really good game. Awesome soundtrack, nice art style and a good 'story', like a single-player game is awesome, but this is what we were waiting for, multiplayer!  I'm not a big survival games fan but this one is awesome, the gameplay is so nice and different, an awesome multiplayer! Good job guys!      Accidently Reviewed",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,You'll die from anything but starvation,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,You can pay money to buy a starving simulator. What a time to be alive,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"  I joined a server and the owner leaded me to her or his base. It was in a cave and I was kind of unsure if it's safe. They were like 'relax!' After surviving many earthquakes and food issues. I found all of us together at base. My health was low for all the rocks that fell on me so I started eating light bulbs. The owner asked 'What are you eating?' I replied with,' Lightbulbs.'   10 seconds later I got kicked from the server because I ate lightbulbs.   10/10 would eat lightbulbs again",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"After playing for over 500Hrs, I gotta say, I really enjoy this game. With all the content that's been put on this and more coming along with updates keeps this game experience fun, but at the same time, their's plenty of cons about this game for new players joining the Don't Starve Together Community.  BEFORE YOU CONTINUE --------------------------  I highly Suggest you play solo mode by making a new server and setting it to solo before playing online to understand some simple mechanics and getting the basics on what to do in-game OR buy the originial Don't Starve and play that before playing Don't Starve Together  Cons ------- *Don't always expect a helpful hand with other players (Sometimes), people like me or any other long time player can't babysit and take care of you and teach you the ropes of every little thing, your first time or how many times you play this should be you trying new things and learning technquies yourself.(or use google for resource)  * Play with friends, it's always fun to play with randoms, but we all know that its more interesting playing with your buds while trying to fight off creatures and survive.  * Trolls are everywhere, you don't think it'll happen, but it will, it happens alot in this game so be mindful on who you trust and want to stay at your base.  Pros ------- * Fun game, the replay value is so good, with different ways to start up and lots of areas to explore.  * Your not alone now, you can work together with your friends and experience everything that the original don't starve game had to offer, with more content being added on to it.  * It's a Indie game with a community thats been thriving for so long, keeping this game alive and active either on the forums or in-game, developers actually listen to the players in the forums.  * You get to unlock Gifts that lets you get various custom skins for some of the objects in-game, which isn't in the original Don't Starve.  So yeah, this game is fun and if your into survival games i reccomend buying this, either on a sale or whenever, don't miss out, its worth at least giving it a shot, if you don't enjoy it then refund and get your money back, simple.  Thanks for reading if you did &amp; I'll see you online ^)",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,1st time playing Don't Starve Together:  0. No tutorial  1. Collect items randomly. 2. Read recipes until night. 3. Died.  4. Start over and collect items properly. 5. Found a frog. 6. Died.  7. Start over on other server (as Webber). 8. Died because pigs.  As you can see my gameplay time... I'm really afraid of playing this game in weekdays. This game is really fun by yourself OR with friends.   When I'm playing alone:  1. Exploring all parts of map. 2. Witnesses some tentacles vs mermaids in marsh. 3. Trying to take some weapons and foods. 4. Died. 5. Repeat.   When I'm playing together:  1. Exploring some parts of map. 2. Find material to build a base. 3. Decorate the base. 4. ...... 5. Forgot to sleep.  10/10 will forgot time IRL.,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Very enjoyable experience overall, one of the few games that I would show to people and not feel bad for doing so.  Art style heavily influenced from Burtonland. Developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter. Monster AI is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional, like Dark Souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours.  Game won't hold your hand when playing, so discovery is half the battle. That being said for someone who knows what they're doing the game currently has little to offer, and it is easy to be 'unkillable' in less than 20 in-game days- the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them.  Through the Ages content should give more 'end-game' activities, but it is not here yet as of this review.  The game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle. It is easy to do once you've mastered the skills, but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble.",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"&gt;Play with noob friends &gt;Friends don't know how to do anything useful &gt;Does everything for friends, they still manage to die  10/10 would play Don't Starve instead again",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Personally, I LOVE this game.  Pro's to buying this game: You get to play with other people in the steam community, there's a chat, sometimes you need the help, everyone knows new things about the game that you didn't know and you can all come together and be one awesome base.  Con's to buying this game: There is no age recommendation and some children (childish children) play this game and they don't talk the entire time, steal your supplies and light your base on fire. But that's also a reason to take mods into consideration if you're trying to run a dedicated server because you can add a mod to prevent such actions. Then ban them :)  Now, I'm not saying that you have to talk in the chat but please ask for supplies. They are there if you absolutely need them though, or you ask. It's hard to play a game that's vanilla without a chest lock mod, but please, just ask. Also, when you light our base on fire, your lighting hours of our work on fire and burning it to the ground. You should have a temp ban from the game, js.  Over all, I do recommend this game and encourage everyone to give it a try!  Happy gaming",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"Day 21: I joined a public server, it started winter. Collected some grass and twigs to survive the winter. Plus collecting some food for winter. Asked the server 'Where is base?' they ignored me.  Day 22: It started snowing. I got no winter stuff it started snowing I met 2 really friendly untalkative people. They told me they just joined too but they gave me some wood, twigs, grass and food. I found a cave and went inside collecting some stuff to make science and alchemy engine.  Day 23: Made a thermal stone and felt confident to survive the winter. The new comers all died except for me. They all left the game except the people who lives in their base.  Day 24: 2 griefers joined, I asked the people who lived in the base to pick me up then the 2 griefers lied and said 'He burned the base' 'His at your base stealing your ♥♥♥♥'. His other griefer friend supported him and said 'Im a witness, I saw him burning your base and stealing the food'.  But then I was really far away from their base and lived in a cave solo. They were convinced by the 2 griefers and votekicked me. I got banned. 10/10 would want to meet the community again",1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,"So... Don't Starve Together... right. Anyway, it's not just   another   survival game. Usually survival games aren't my kind of jam. But this one is something different.

Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger, collect resources from different biomes and creatures, build and craft required resources such as food, weapons and light! Make sure you always have a fire for nighttime!  Each character has it's own pros and cons, except Wilson, who's a great playable character for newbies. Also each character is voiced by a different instrument, that's what I personally love the most about the game.  Don't Starve Together includes Reign of Giants content. So there are 4 seasons and most people would think that winter is the hardest season to survive. Wait til' summer, darling. Winter is easy peasy comparing to summer. Autumn is the real chill season, so give it some love too, plebs.  I highly recommend it to peeps who enjoy survival that is both realistic and challenging at times but also mixed with creepy elements. Play this with your buddy, if you'd like to have a good time and ruin your friendship.   Funny fact:  I play this game mostly alone, since my buddy is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't want to play this game, anymore.",1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,"To maximize the joy from this game, i suggest you: A) Read some decent guides, if you don't want to spend time learning the hard way.  B) Make dedicated server and get decent hardware. With Caves turned on, you're running 2 servers at same time. (i5 + 16 GB RAM) and i haven't encountered any fps drops.  C) Add some skillful friends from public servers, whose'll be able to play at same time you do.  Playing closed survival game with few more people makes the game much more better than playing on public servers. With ability to ban, rollback and other console commands, your game won't be ruined by trolls and other junk people being.",1,1

If you get beat it's just because you don't know how to work the combat system. If your base gets destroyed learn to build a better one, it's not that hard.",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,"Everyone I encountered seemed to be out for blood. I tried to make so many friends and they all cut me down without a word.  So I adapted.  Every living thing had became a threat.   Until I met him.  He was on top of a dirt mound on the beach, pounding at it.  I cautiously approached him, ready to strike, but then he turned around and said hello.  I wasn't used to such kindness. So I did the most logical thing I could think of. I ran.   Once I knew I was hidden, I watched and followed him. He was a small man, just trying to build himself a house with a garden.   I stayed on him for what felt like days, until I decided he had to die. So I waited for night. He was tending his cabbage garden when I approached him from behind. Something inside me told me he needed to live. So I stood there, club in hand, frozen.  He turned around and just starred for a second, and then said hello again in a friendly voice.  Something changed inside me. I knew I had found a friend.  So I followed him. I helped him gather resources, I protected him as he built our house.  I was his silent brute. I kept him safe.   Until one day he asked me to go tend the apples.   It was dusk. I walked the path to our apple trees. Until I saw him.  I tried to duck into the brush, but I wasn't quick enough, he approached me and said hello.  I thought he was friendly. I asked him to follow me.  But then his sadistic partner jumped out of the brush, striking me with his axe.  I tried to fight back but they were too strong for this mere man.  I ran for my only ally.  He didn't understand. As I ran down the hill to our half built house I lit my torch and jumped wildly.  He did the same.  But then he saw my pursuers.   He pulled out his club but we were no match for these men.  I was struck down first. He knocked me to the ground and smashed my legs and continued to beat me.  As I laid in my own blood and ♥♥♥♥, I watched my best friend become nothing but a lifeless corpse.  And I knew I'd never see him again.  RIP: Poshy  A Master, A Friend  Actual review: I really enjoy this game, it runs really well on my pc and overall is pretty fun. I haven't seen any hackers yet that everyone has mentioned (Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they exist)  7/10",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,"+600 hours already,   This game. man, i tell ya.  This along with only 2 games only. One of the BEST games i have ever played. and was lucky to.  Everything about this game, just works. and it's perfect. the amount of things you can do, not just pvp 1 way. there are so many things to do, in so many ways. Honestly, a work of art. this game is without a doubt one of the best/is games i have ever played. to hell with steam reviews,  i played this game. and i played it alot. and i sure as hell wont change my opinion ever that this game is the best game i have ever played. and i played a lot of games.

344760,Reign Of Kings,Having a blast. I have more then 300+ hours in the game so far and still the options of the day to day life in this game is never predictable. The ONLY bad thing with the game is the hackers that can come in and want to make the experience bad for others.,1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,"On the right server, this game is a pleasure. I played most of my five hundred hours on Moon's whitelisted roleplay server and my own server. There are plenty pieces available for a great medieval rp experience. This survival aspect of this game is good, but the rp was the core aspect that kept me coming back.  &gt; pros &lt; ▪ Building is fun, lots of potential for great architecture. ▪ Combat is decent and skill based when there is no lag. ▪ Fun rp items like jester hats, whips, cages, etc. You can let your creativity flow. ▪ Survival aspect is pretty solid. Many different style options to provide and survive.  &gt; cons &lt; ▪ If you play on a public server, the community is pretty garbage. ▪ Cheaters, cheaters, and cheaters. ▪ Devs made major UI and game changes in the last few weeks of beta before fully releasing the game that had yet to be fleshed out and tested. ▪ Many ideas and possibilites with a lot of potential will never be added - (horses, fur clothing, etc).  All in all its a solid game, most of the complaints stem from the garbage community, which is not the developers fault. Find a solid server or make your own otherwise you're probably gonna have a bad time.",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,"I learnt how to play somewhere over the rainbow on a flute,,, 10/10 would do again",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,At the start of the game u will find alot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers with 11 year Olds running around. But when u have found a good server with a good community and etc you will probobly enjoy the game as much as i do. I have currently played 190 hours and i say the game is worth every penny.,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,"I really do like this game but unfortunatly, if you have your own dedicated server, be prepared to go bald with rage. (well, at least i almost did)  If you're the kind of person to just join a server then great! you'll have lots of fun....until a server wipe is required and then you'll lose EVERYTHING!  If you're the kind of person to host your own server or rent one then great! you'll have lots of fun with the admin commands, creating your roleplay world....until a server wipe is required.  I was hoping that when they released the game, the server wipes would stop....Did they? i hear you ask. No, no they bloody well didn't.",1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Yes this game is sort of dead but just because you cant get into a server with more than 20 people doesnt make it a bad game. The pvp, building, community, and raiding are all amazing. They might not update the game but thats just leaving the old days and you wont have to get used to something different.",1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,"I love the game, and these are my reasons why. You need to one, find a good enough server to play on, yes there are a quite a lot of hackers on offical servers that no one cares to do anything about. I recomend to join a community server with good active admin, and become a part of the community.  Now on to the game itself This game has the normal 3 stage crafting such as early game, mid game, and of course late game. I love all of these stages and usually all games that have these systems usually do well. Theres different base teirs which can add hours of gameplay to the game, plus playing with buddies adds it that much more.  you can raid, build castles, destroy castles, become a king, kidnap, kill the king, break out of a prison, and hunt Why does that not sound fun? Most peoples response to this question is that 'it's Code}{atch' they've given up on another game. My answer to that is no.. ♥♥♥♥ you because yes they don't update the game with new content very often but they do update it with bug fixes and nerfs and buffs anything a normal game needs. Theres enough content to play for hundreds of hours, and when you're done play another game and start this one again later in time.",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,"What a fun game this is. Well done. Very easy game to play. Worth buying this game. Update. I have been playing this game for, 4 months now. Looks great. Building is easy, It is up to the player, what server type each player wants, ie: PVE or PVP. As things stand, I do not know, if the developers are adding new stuff or not. Good fun game to play with friends. In my view, a map editor, would be a nice thing to add.",1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,"The funniest game of my life. Had so much fun and made loads of friends throughout my hours. I loved this game when i bought it, and my opinion of it doesnt change because it was released. The game in the trailers is what i thought i was buying, but there is so much fun RP in it that the trailers dont show. Everybody in the community is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, thats what makes it so funny. If u too are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like myself, this is your game.",1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,"I would say, as one of the people with the most hours invested into this game, that it is totally worth a buy.  **UPDATE** After many months of playing and 300+ hours later, I still feel that this game is worth the buy.

344760,Reign Of Kings,"I'm changing my review...  1. Graphics - The graphics are pretty damn good, except maybe the player graphics but very good nonetheless. You get some high frames on the highest settings if your computer has a good graphics card. (Running r9 280x). So all in all if it';s graphics and good frames your looking for, get this game.  2. Combat - The combat is fairly straight forward it's like chivalry and failry good. My only problem with it is, you are pretty much screwed no matter what if someone has a tier above you in terms of weapons/armor. Still it is really good so if your wanting the combat; get this game.  3. Glitches/bugs/hackers - I have never ran into any game breaking glitches or bugs in this game, nor have my friends (that I know of). But I have had my fair share of hackers which is never fun. But you will not always have the bad luck I do so... You can get this game knowing there are no bad glitches and bugs.  4. Servers - The official servers all seem to be pretty good ones, and the community servers run real nice to in terms of ping, although I have died in combat a few times cause my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet (although in all honesty about half the time I have died in combat because of my 'internet' is just cause I have terrible combat prowess.) So all in all the servers are usually good in terms of ping and even if you have ♥♥♥♥ internet like me you can enjoy this game.  5. Multiplayer - The multiplayer in this game is really good, like really good. Thee only problem I have with it is it is force multiplayer. No singleplayer and no lan with just friends :(. Honestly though it is good, it does have the DayZ vibe though so watch out for players you do not trust.   I rate this game a solid 6/10. In other words get this game.",1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Personnally, I loved this game, despite hackers(Which are less frequent than one would think, and are sometimes just funny)  Examples of hackers i hate -♥♥♥♥ing seige engines everywhere, literally can't build on the map  Examples of hackers im fine with -Goes in, kills hacker king, then dupes his loot and gives everyone in game that loot by nocliping  Basically what im trying to say, is that the biggest problem with this game is that the community is just a huge bag of ♥♥♥♥♥.  I mean, dont get me wrong. You can swing your ♥♥♥♥ around aswell, and thats what it feels like sometimes, just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to ruin eachothers day.   The ONLY way to play this game is with a friend you TRUST, because honestly, nothing is worse than haveing everything you work on being taken by a 'Friend' after about 3 full days of playing on a server.   That being said I've had some truly enjoyable times playing this game. For example, once I had full teir armor and the kings sword, and I had to defend WAVES of little black midgets(Their guild was the black midget army, which was hilarious) And they stopped their onslaught after about the 10 wave of deaths. They got my sword and armor tho;-;  This game can be fun, and since I got it on sale, it was certainly worth $10. I reccomend buying it on sale, just like any other title. Just remember that noone should be trusted, and your play experience will vastly improve. And do the community a favor, STOP GREIFING NEWSPAWNS. Thanks.",1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Im looking at all the reviews right now and i am like, wtf. I actually really like this game and played it for a while before i got a new game. It is not a bad game and is very unique in a lot of ways. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends this is it. You can start a clan and play together. It is just the right size map that you don't feel like everyone is right next to you but it is not impossible to find your friends. It is true that the archery is terrible but you dont need it. You can be a complete dominator of the world if you want to or you can serve under the king. The king gets good gear but it is not over powered. There is even a tax system to put over the peasents but it does not aplly to your group. I will not say this is the perfect game for everyone though. It no only has a few errors but is more of a social game so if you don't have anyone to play with it is not the game for you. I got this game with all of my friends and we had a blast.

344760,Reign Of Kings,"This is a very detailed review of the game, it will discuss the different functions within it.  Crafting System:  There is a large crafting system in Reign of Kings, to unlock more recipes you have to upgrade certain stations.   Being King:  When your king you can set taxes for everyone to pay on the server. You have access to the best sword in the game and the kings crown.  Crest System:  The crest system is where you can conquer land for your guild. There are 3 types of crests(leather, iron and steel), each one conquers larger amounts of land, you can upgrade them.  Building system:  The building system is very flexible, you can create a variety of different structures with it. The building system uses blocks, but this is what makes it flexible as you can create huge structures. There are 9 different block types, cobblestone, reinforced wood iron and stone blocks cannot be broken by melee weapons, so I encourage you to use these blocks for your buildings. Do you want to create a small home to live in or a huge fortress? The choice is yours.  Siege:  To siege you need to gather lots of materials. You have to craft a siegeworks before any siege weapons can be crafted. Siege weapons include the Ballista and Trebuchet.  Capture:  You can capture other players with a rope or shackles. The rope can be broken out of by a sharp stone and the shackles with a lockpick. You can put captured players in cages or use torture devices on them.   Overall rating:  8.0/10  Other:  Also try my Reign of Kings server!  'Empires RP-No KoS/Kits/Rules/Active Staff'!.",1,0

Some cool stuff like tying people up with rope big massive catapults for destroying huge bases stuff like that.  Its fun if your a role player, pretty fun if your not.  Could do with more stuff being added to it though lately its quitened down and its not dead but not exactly that populated either.

The reason I think the game went down hill is the community's fault. The game itself is still very fun, but the people are not.

344760,Reign Of Kings,"What this game needs is a proper LAN option that doesn't require tons of tweaking; because you will run into hackers and exploiters on any server whatsoever, that means ugly framerate killing castles that look completely square and dying inside your own house, in your own bed, behind walls, with a crest - because they can do whatever they want with hacks.  That being said, it's still a smooth game that works really well in both firstperson and thirdperson, woodcutting has never been so satisfying as in this game, animations are decent, although swimming looks terrible in thirdperson - animals can't swim, they can however run at full speed into water and keep running on the bottom of the sea rendering them completely safe from all harm.  Taxes aren't optional, if someone has claimed the throne, you will automatically pay taxes when gathering resources, so there's no avoiding that. I find that pretty annoying, how about marking someone a criminal if they haven't pressed 'pay taxes' within 24 hours of game time? And then other players would be awarded a bounty for hunting them down, if the king/queen is still in command.  All in all, it's a decent game, but I was just slain by what I assume was a hacker, since I died inside a house with a functioning crest and lost everything - so I'm probably going to take a break.",1,0

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Soo since half of the Negative Reviews are people complaining like 'Uhhh Laggy as F*ck', 'I Got Killed OMFG LOLOLOL Worst Game Ever' or 'OMG High Pitched Kiddy-Voices Everywhere' let me tell you some Good things.  - If the Game laggs you must have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC since neither did I nor one of my 5 Friends has encounterd any Lagg, except for One Time Rendering of Castles (Which is absolutely normal for any Survival Game if the Buildings get too big)  - There arent more bugs and glitches than in any other Survival Game out there and considering the Price its actually pretty good  - Capturing People with a Rope and dragging them allover is a lot of Fun, and once you got some Prisons or Torture Devices can cause serious Laughing attacks (Especially if you play with multiple Friends, which i can only recommend)  - The Block Like Building style is something that rarely any survival Game like this has and is way cooler then building on Foundations like in Rust or Ark (IMO)  - Getting fully Armored and having the Strongest Weapons doesnt make you Overpowered. If you can time your attacks and block the Enemys even an Naked guy wielding a Club can kill a fully armored Knight.  Since i cant be all positive though i better list some of the Negatives:  - Playing alone really isnt much Fun, grab some Friends!  - There are some bugs in the Game that can kill you, but they almost exclusively happen when you get stuck in your buildings Doors or Torture Device (Always have a Bed so that you can respawn rightaway)  - Character Creation is pretty scarce the Hairstlyes look pretty crappy and theres only 3 Beards.  - Ressources Generate at specific places on the Map which makes people camp on Ressource Spots, and if you dont know where to search for the Ressources it can be annoying to find  - Theres neither a Map nor a Compass.  - The Map is kinda small compared to other Survival Games.  I can totally recommend this Game escpecially while its on Sale. If you have some friends and want to play a Survival Game go for it! Dont let those Negative Reviews with their Playtime of 40-200h tell you otherwise, im pretty sure some of them were written right after Ragequitting because some 'Kiddys' wrecked their Base.",1,1

The gameplay makes up for it, and honestly the first time I died in a doorway or was slung 200 metres into the air by a fallen tree, I just laughed my heart out. This game is really fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes a survival game with a lot of possibilities to do.

344760,Reign Of Kings,"Overall a good game. After recent patches there is little bugs in the game. Of course you may abuse physics, like boosting (jumping on top if another jumping player) in order to get over not very tall fence, etc.  Pros: Good community servers with very strict rules for RP Loads of no rules official servers for 12 years old, just to play around Excellent guild / clan / King system, where king can impose a tax possibility of overthrowing the king by uniting underdog guilds. etc Good medieval fights with swords, shields, bows, crossbows, etc,... plus good castle sedge weapons  Excellent crafting system, etc Buildings are not easily destructible like in RUST, so what ever you've buid will still be there next day, unless you are in a war with another guild Not expensive game, so must have it!  Cons: Takes a lot of your time As a King you will have extra responsibility to be in the server and do a good role play, hence even more time spent in the game. PING sensitive game, i.e. low Ping = lose fights ",1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,"I got this game for me and my friend and at first it is very hard, not beacause of the survival element but that the more experienced players 'hunt you down' so makes it very hard to start off. The game doesnt run particularly smoothly on my pc so I lowered the resolution and that helped fairly.  The concept is amazing and is very enjoyable to play if you put the hours in and get far into the game. This is definitely a game to have a friend or two playing with you as it quite difficult to get the resources and fight off players on your own. However, you do meet people in the game that are friendly and can help you and even join your guild or join theirs. The combat was an attempt to make it realistic which didnt really work so it makes it hard to kill other players.

34900,Bad Rats,"This game....  The storyline involves a group of a rogue military unit who have turned on their Cat superiors. In the year 20XX, hope rides alone as the single group of rats moves forward in a near futile attempt to usurp the catriarchy.   Touching on heavy and mature themes such as sexism, xenophobia, coming of age and even existentialism, the decisions you make in this game echo thoughout the game's final act.   Gameplay wise, this game's controls are responsive and intuitive, and the multiple difficulty selections such as 'Bad Rat must Die' mode and the aptly titled 'The Rat's Revengeance' mode make this game possibly the most non-artifical difficulty challenge ever crafted by human hands.   The graphics look even better than Deadly Premonition, and I thought that wasn't possible. This game looks just like what kids of the late 80's thought video-games might look like in the late 2020's.   Lastly, the sound is fantastic. With an OST rivaling the Sonic game Bioware did for the DS, smooth MIDI guitars will comfort you throughout tense and dramatic scenes.    Overall, this game is one of the best games I've ever played. My only complaint is that the game's ending leaves much to be desired, with a cliff-hanger involving the protaganist's brother being one of the Cats all along being followed by an after-credits dance scene to the catchy smash hit 'All-Star' by Smash Mouth.    10/10",1,1

34900,Bad Rats,"Bad Rats is a revolutionary first person shooter that sets a new standard for this era of gaming. This is game published by Electronic Arts and is developed by Dice on the new Frostbite 4 engine to provide a superior graphic fidelity compared to other marvellous titles including Crisis 3. The story of the game takes place in the year 2035 when North Korea officially ends the cease fire for the Korean War and launches a series of surprise attacks on the United States of America and South Korea. North Korea launches an overwhelming amount of long range ballistic missiles towards major metropolitan areas in the United States which devastates the population and cripples the infrastructure of the government to be able to function properly to contain control of the United States. North Korea launches a full scale aerial campaign on Seoul with a relentless wave of troops pouring across the DMZ of North Korea and South Korea. China and the rebuilt Soviet Union organized by Vladimir Putin has been supplying North Korea with highly advanced military technology and expertise has secretly been supporting North Korea for a war since 2006! You play as a squad in the Navy Seals for the United States called “Bad Rats” Your objective is to assassinate all cats in the region of Asia to cut off all food supplies from the North Koreans and collapse the regime of Kim Jong Un. Using the destructible environments from the Frostbite 4 engine you must use the environment for a tactical advantage to exterminate all cats from Asia. Fan favourite maps return including Seige of Shainghai where you must collapse a skyscraper to kill all cats in the building. Facial scanning technology from LA Noire returns to add an extra layer of realism with realistic facial animation movements to add more emotion to the already immersive world. This is a highly addicting shooter that takes place in locations across the world from nuclear wasteland America to the glorious lands of North Korea. You have a massive arsenal of over 500 weapons to use with thousands of gadgets and gun camouflages. Bad Rats is integrated with the Steam Workshop which has created thousands of community maps and gun skins to be submitted into the game for future free DLCs called “Operations”. Each operation adds an extra layer of immersion into the game with a huge variety of community maps and skins to be added to expand the already masterpiece of a game. Bad rats is a very skill based shooter and requires extensive training to truly shine in multiplier. Bad Rats is the only first person shooter on the market to add a innovative competitive mode with ranks to determine your skill level. In multiplayer there are 2 teams. Counter Cats and Cats. The counter cats must plant a bomb on one of the two locations on the map to kill the population of cats in the area. The cats must prevent the counter cats or the “bad rats” from planting the bomb by either killing all the Counter Cats or defusing the bomb to save the population of cats in the premise.Bad Rats is a highly addicting shooter that any seasonal gamer should try out but I assume you already have! Bad Rats global sales have exceeded 1 billion on the first day outselling the Call of Duty franchise. It is very rare to see game a game this flawless since the release of Half Life 2. If you like first person shooter games you already own bad rats, if you don't you are missing out on one of the most brilliant game of this century.   Final verdict  Pros Immersive environments Balanced multiplayer Overwhelming amount of content Gorgeous Graphics  Revolutionizes the FPS genre Fantastic and inspiring story Great voice acting Like Half Life 3 but better  Cons Too much graphics  10/10",1,1

34900,Bad Rats,"Just the mere uttering of Bad Rats makes my undergarments salivate. Buying this game was one of the greatest life choices I've made, next to masturbating with a fleshlight made out of an abnormally long umbilical cord.  I've had plenty of experience with murder, terrorism, manslaughter, necrophilia, and pedophilia, so this game was right up my alley. I feel I can connect better with our true lord and saviour, Satan, after playing this game. The gameplay is very challenging and make my insides tingle similar to when I insert a cheese grater into my sphincter. The sound of the bones of the cat getting dissolvied into splinters gets the urine pumping faster than a Jew getting out of a shower. The true euphoria of completing a puzzle can only be described in three words: Japanese Rope Bondage.  Overall, this game has fulfilled every single one of my fetishes, which I was surprised the developers would know about my anal seepage fetish. I'd give it a 9.5/10, since no game can be perfect. I could use more visible spinal cords here and there, but in general a great game. Pick up a copy for the kids, neighbors, and heck, even the mentally insane dominatrix!",1,1

34900,Bad Rats,"Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge takes place during the 1960s in the Cold War, around 20 years after the events of World War II. It focuses on CIA clandestine black operations carried out behind enemy lines. Missions take place in various locations around the globe such as the Ural Mountains in eastern USSR, Kazakhstan in central USSR, Cuba, Hong Kong, Laos, South Vietnam, the Arctic circle and Siberia. The single-player campaign revolves around an experimental chemical weapon.  The main protagonist the player controls is SAD/SOG special forces operative Bad Rat (Sam Worthington), occasionally CIA agent Mad Rat (Ed Harris), and some other characters are playable to progress the story. Bad Rat is often joined by fellow operatives Rad Rat (James C. Burns) and Dad Rat (Ice Cube), while Mad Rat teams up with Lad Rat (Gene Farber), a Russian-born field operative Pad Rat (Gary Oldman), a key character from the Soviet Union, returns along with that game's Russian protagonist Fad Rat (Boris Kievsky) also making an appearance. Bad Rats: the Rat's Revenge also features several historical figures: during the story Bad Rat meets John F. Kennedy, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro.  On February 25, 1968, SAD operative Bad Rat is strapped to a chair in an interrogation room, bombarded with questions by his unseen captors about the location of a numbers station. Bad Rat then recalls several events, as an attempt to answer their questions.  In 1961, Bad Rat, Rad Rat, and Dad Rat take part in Operation 40 to assassinate Fidel Castro in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Bad Rat apparently succeeds and stays behind to protect the extraction plane from an oncoming blockade, before being captured by the real Castro, having shot a double. Handed over to General Gad Rat to be held captive at Vorkuta Gulag, Bad Rat befriends inmate and former Red Army soldier Pad Rat. Pad Rat recounts to Bad Rat the identities of his enemies, the same people involved in Bad Rat’s torture: Gad Rat, his right-hand man Kad Rat, and ex-Nazi scientist Zad Rat, who defected to the Soviet Union.  In October 1945, Pad Rat and Fad Rat were sent to extract Zad Rat from a Nazi base in the Arctic. Gad Rat later betrayed them by testing Zad Rat's creation, a nerve agent known as 'Nova-6', on Fad Rat and other soldiers in a ship. Pad Rat was spared the same fate when British commandos, also attempting to acquire Nova-6, attacked the Soviets. During the confusion, Pad Rat destroyed the Nova-6 and escaped only to be captured by the Soviets and sent to the Vorkuta Gulag. However, the Soviets recreated it using Zad Rat and a British scientist, Cad Rat.  Over a year later, Bad Rat and Pad Rat spark a prisoner uprising to escape the gulag, but only Bad Rat escapes and Pad Rat is captured. One month later, President John F. Kennedy meets Bad Rat and authorizes a mission to assassinate Gad Rat. Bad Rat briefly envisions aiming his side arm at Kennedy. In November 1963, Bad Rat, Rad Rat, Dad Rat and Lad Rat are dispatched to Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakh SSR to disrupt the Soviet space program and eliminate members of 'Ascension', a Soviet program giving sanctuary to Nazi scientists in exchange for their knowledge. Lad Rat is captured and Kad Rat stabs out his left eye. Bad Rat and his team rescue him and destroy the Soyuz spacecraft, while Rad Rat apparently kills Gad Rat in a car explosion, though Bad Rat believes him to be alive.  In 1968, the team is sent to Vietnam. After defending Khe Sanh, they recover a dossier on Gad Rat from a Russian defector in Hue during the Tet Offensive. Bad Rat finds the defector is none other than Pad Rat. They then penetrate Laos to recover a Nova-6 shipment from a downed Soviet plane. At the crash site the plane collapses and they are captured by Viet Cong and Spetznaz infiltrators. Dad Rat is executed, while Rad Rat and Bad Rat hijack an Mi-24 Hind and rescue Pad Rat at Kad Rat's base before confronting Kad Rat himself. Rad Rat stabs Kad Rat, gaining the upper hand, but Kad Rat pulls the pins off four grenades strapped to his chest;Rad Rat sacrifices himself by pushing Kad Rat and himself out a window. In a huge explosion, Bad Rat presumes the two dead.  Meanwhile, Mad Rat and Lad Rat interrogate Cad Rat in Kowloon Walled City. Cad Rat reveals the location of a hidden facility in Mount Yamantau before being killed by Gad Rat's men. Mad Rat and Lad Rat move to destroy the facility and receive a transmission from Zad Rat requesting to meet at Rebirth Island, as Gad Rat has begun killing loose ends. Bad Rat and Pad Rat head there to assassinate Zad Rat at the same time, succeeding just as Mad Rat and Lad Rat arrive. Bad Rat is adamant that Pad Rat executed Zad Rat, but Mad Rat had witnessed Bad Rat carrying out the act alone.  At this point, Mad Rat and Lad Rat are revealed as Bad Rat's interrogators. Gad Rat has communist sleeper cells placed all over the United States which, when ordered by the numbers broadcast, will release the Nova-6 gas. As a result, the U.S. is preparing a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, which will lead to a full-scale war. Mad Rat needed Zad Rat to abort the gas launch, but after his death, only Bad Rat has any knowledge of the numbers station. Mad Rat reveals that Gad Rat brainwashed Bad Rat to understand the numbers broadcasts, effectively making him a Soviet sleeper agent. It is revealed that the real Pad Rat never escaped, but died during the Vorkuta break out; and that the Soviet defector in Hue was actually killed before Bad Rat reached him. Bad Rat’s visions of Pad Rat are a result of a dissociative disorder caused by the traumatic brainwashing program. Prior to the Vorkuta breakout, Pad Rat had secretly met and reprogrammed Bad Rat to assassinate Gad Rat, Kad Rat and Zad Rat for what they did to him and for killing Fad Rat and his comrades, instead of Bad Rat's original aim to kill the U.S. President. Bad Rat finally remembers the location of the station: a Russian cargo ship called Rusalka off the coast of Cuba.  An assault on the Rusalka begins, with Bad Rat and Mad Rat infiltrating the underwater submarine and broadcast station protected by the ship, intended to be used for an invasion of the U.S. after the planned Nova-6 attack. Confirming that the Rusalka is the numbers station, Mad Rat calls in the US Navy to destroy the ship and its underwater base. Bad Rat and Mad Rat finally confront Gad Rat in the lower levels of the facility. Gad Rat taunts Bad Rat and hints at his hand in assassinating Kennedy, but Bad Rat strangles him to death and escapes with Mad Rat. They regroup with Lad Rat, who declares victory. Archive footage of President Kennedy prior to his assassination is shown, revealing Bad Rat was in the crowd of onlookers who watched Kennedy disembark from Air Force One in Lovefield, implicitly suggesting that Bad Rat may have carried out his initial programming. A hidden message that can be accessed in the game's main menu reveals that Rad Rat survived the confrontation with Kad Rat and is currently incarcerated in the Hanoi Hilton.",1,1
34900,Bad Rats,how to play bad rats  step one: kill yourself,1,1
34900,Bad Rats,"I was tempted to roundly deride Bat Rats: the Rats' Revenge. Among it's various sins include blatant typos, unclear measurement units, terrible grammar, and awful physics that ruin the very heart of the game itself. I mean, what kind of physics-based puzzle game do you have when the physics malfunction half of the time? Balls flying out into an unneccessary third dimension, assuming you even correctly triggered your first step with your rat set at 38 Rat Angular Units to go after 40 Rat Time Units.   But I digress, the game is flawed, to be sure. In fact as I was churning my way through this game, the livestream audience goading me on as though demons with lashes made of fire and thorns, I began to see this game for what it was; Divine retribution. After thirty maps or so, when blood from my very eyes began to splatter my keyboard, I truly understood why Bad Rats was put on this planet.  Initially, I began to lose faith. As would any man, I questioned many things during this trial. 'Why would God do this to me? Why would a God of 'Good' let a game such as 'Bad Rats' Ever be created?' And on and on I questioned. I questioned God's purpose, my purpose, and the purpose of the tormentor who had begun to work my fingers to the very bone.   Finally, it dawned on me.  A game of such pure agony, such pure punishment, could never have been crafted by mortal hands. At last I realized that the only reason God would allow such a travesty as Bad Rats into this world is to be an obstacle to overcome to understand that truly he exists. To be sure, Bad Rats may have been programmed by 'imagine4' but the developer was none other than Christ Jesus. How else would such a perfect trial have been crafted but through the intervention of the only being that could craft the cosmos into the reality that you and I enjoy every day? That is the power that was put into Bad Rats. That is the power that has turned this game into an engine of languish.   I highly reccomend Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, but know that you should not accept such a task lightly. You may experience Bad Rats different from the way I did, but nonetheless you will emerge from it a changed person.",1,0

34900,Bad Rats,"  According to all known laws of aviation,    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.    Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.    The bee, of course, flies anyway    because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.    Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up.

34900,Bad Rats,"Game: Bad Rats  Genre: MMO/Shooter  Review: The planet of terminus is in danger. A great evil has risen. A hero wil rise. A Bad rat. Bad Rats is a FPS Shooter MMO where YOU the player create your very won Rat. You choose from 6 diffrent classes. Each classes has their own special skills and skill trees. It's a joy to watch your Rat level up and get new perks. The story is pretty good. You have to save the planet Terminus from an unkown danger. As you No Scope hordes of enemies you discover more lore and history about Terminus. As we all know Bad Rats is a sequel to Superman 64 and it worth your money. Allthough i did feel like the online system should have been better. It is an MMO, but there is very little you can do with your friends besides deathmatches and Quick scope 1v1. Anyway to sum it up Bad Rats is a really good game. It has tight controls, beatiful graphics, nice gameplay and a interresting story. And i can't wait to hit my 500 hour.  Enjoy The Game",1,1
34900,Bad Rats,"Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ('leader') of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of Nazi Germany, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was a central figure of the Holocaust.  Hitler was born into a German-speaking Austrian family and raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the NSDAP, in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.  By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, which led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans—actions which gave him significant popular support.  Hitler sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.  Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ('sub-humans') and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II.

34900,Bad Rats,"Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge is an Incredible Machine clone, where the player is given a ball and a cat to kill. The player must use various kind of specially trained rats to direct a ball towards an item that will kill the cat. If you - like me - are tired of people posting cat pictures on the Internet or cat videos on Youtube, this game will definitely put a smile on your face. Take some acid in the face, dumb ugly cat!  The game uses an innovative random physics system to be completely different from other Incredible Machine style puzzle games. Each attempt will produce a different result, even if you do not change the position of your rats at all. It keeps the game fresh and interesting during your journey through its 44 breathtaking levels, as no attempt is exactly the same. Sometimes the developer-given solutions won't work either, in which case you must find a solution of your own. Or repeat the developer solution until it works, it's all your choice as a player. Much more meaningful than the choices that Mass Effect 3 gave its players.  While the game may look 2.5D (a sidescroller with 3D graphics), do not be fooled by the screenshots. The game is fully rendered in 3D, including the physics. The ball can and will move on the Z axis. Usually this is not in your favor, but it does a good job showcasing the 3D random physics engine lovingly crafted by the creative minds at Invent4 Entertainment. Sadly, there is no level editor included in the game so people can't experiment with the engine themselves.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game. The only bad part of the game I can think of is that it is quite short. Most people will finish the game in about 4 hours. But the game usually goes all the way down to 0.40€ on Steam sales, which is not much at all for a few hours of great cat-killing time! Gift it to your friends too, they will appreciate it.",1,0
34900,Bad Rats,The gameplay may be subpar but where this game really shines is the symbolism and characters. I think there's a bit of the terrorist rat in all of us.,1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"I was finally about to get my new ship, I just needed to complete this one trade run and all was dandy... Then I realised; I forgot to refuel at the next star I totally shut my engines off to try to get a clear picture of what was happening. Looking at my computers I found a small station about 16,000Ls away. I wasn't sure if I could make it with the fuel I had so I just did it, I was dead either way.   Flying through space watching that fuel gauge drain is the scariest thing I've had to do in this game, The thing was so close to empty that I had all but written myself off. Then out of nowhere another play is trying to rip me from warp! This was the first time it had happened to me so naturally I succumbed to to the tear.   I figured at this point the fuel issue was out the window and I wouldn't have a chance getting to the station, so I turn and fight but he's in an attack vessle so I'm getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me on a silver platter. On the verge of complete acceptance of defeat, I get a second wind. I decide 'No! I wont let it end like this', I activate the warp drive and as it's charging try to put some distance between my attacker and myself. I'm on 6% HP at this point and take another hit... Down to 3%, one more hit and I'm done.  The warp drive activates! With a measly 3% HP I make my way to the station I had previously tried to get to. The fuel I have is scaring the crap out of me, the whole thing could shut down any second and at this point I'm not even thinking about how I'm going to dock on this low HP since in the past I have always damaged my ship.  I drop from warp, thankfully in the right place. I begin docking preparation and then I see someone is trolling the airlock. The station quickly dispatches him but leaves a mess of debris in my way, Slowly I try to squeeze past it all I mage to get past most of it but then one stray unavoidable piece floats towards me and hits the canopy of the ship.... 1%. I crap my pants a little and then continue. I touch down the softest landing I have ever done and let out a massive sigh of release as repair and refuel.  10/10 Would have heart attack again.",1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,"This game is really quite good, and there is a lot to it. The game's flight mechanics are simple enough that they can be easily grasped and intuitively controlled faster than with most flight games. Entering this game, you should expect a learning curve, and for part of the fun being exploring all the things you can do as you learn. If you're expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the game, you're going to blunder around for an hour, rage quit, and then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off. This game is a sandbox. Be prepared to find your own way. Lets get to the game itself:  The general point of the game is to reach 'Elite' rank. You can do this via combat, trading, or exploration. Lets talk about each of these three types of play in turn:  Combat: Excellent part of this game. There are a diverse range of weapons, each which function differently and place different strains on your ship's loadout. You want to use Plasma Accelerators? Well, those have major power drain, so you need your ship to have a large power plant. Bigger shield? More power. Shield cell banks? More power. Planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyable, and ongoing experience throughout the game. As far as combat goes, you can approach it as a bounty hunter, going out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice... Or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilots, breaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market. Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game. If nothing else, you'll get a solid 20-30 hours out of combat progression.  Trading: This part is a bit more up in the air to a lot of people. Some people don't like the repetitious nature of trading in the game, but it really depends on what you look for. Trading involves going to different stations, recording what they have in high demand, and what they have in high supply, and linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demand, and which demand what the first station has in high supply. In other words, basic supply/demand economics, you trade the goods between stations. This can be a bit dull, other than when pirates are after you, but it really depends what you want. This is the Euro-Truck Simulator part of the game. If you want something relaxing, flying between stations while listening to a podcast, audiobook, or watching a TV show, trading is for you.  Exploration: The galaxy is big. Bigger than I think most of us have a grasp of. Many of us know 'Well, the galaxy is obviously massive', but there's a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all. Sol, that is the solar system earth is found in, is a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center. It takes around 20-30 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in non-stop jumping from star to star. To travel all around the galaxy, you're talking months worth of time devoted to exploring. And that doesn't even count the time it takes to scan each system, and go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money. Why would anyone want to do this? Well, have you ever flown up to a black hole, and seen the light distort around it in an eerie, terrorizing sense of dread? Have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape? Have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole? These are the types of things you see when you explore, and for many, the feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile. If you're the first one to explore something, your name is also tagged to it forever. The civilized area of space only takes about 500 LY around Sol, with the rest up to being explored.  Peripherals: The game works very well with a mouse and keyboard, with a XBox 360 controller, and with most joysticks (HOTAS or otherwise). There are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controller, as well as most market joysticks. So you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while you're learning.  Always Online Note: You have a multiplayer option in which you're around other players. Players will try to pirate you, others will bounty hunt for you, etc. You can set up wings, groups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights. Or, if you want to be a recluse, you can play Solo and avoid other players, and just play with NPCs. Or maybe you just want to play with your friend, you can set up a Private Group. All of these require a constant internet connection, but it is for a reason. Anytime you do something in the game, it shapes the political and economic landscape. If you buy resonating separators from Cemiess, you reduce the amount of supply in Cemiess, which makes the price go up. When this happens, the game pings the global server, and changes the value for everyone else in their own servers. So although you are away from other players, what you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyone.  Galactic Political Landscape: There are 3 major factions in the game: the Alliance, Federation, and Empire. Additionally, there are Independent factions bound to specific star systems. Each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems. Lets say you look at a system like Lugh which was ruled by the Federation. Within Lugh, there are many 'parties' that are in government, running for political control. The Federation party is in control. But if players start to do missions against the party in control, if they start to kill police, pirate traders, do things to disrupt the peace in that system, it spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system. They start to demand change. A civil war can break out between the faction in power, and the faction that is not in power, and they fight. Players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bonds, and help shape the outcome of the war. Depending on which side wins, the system may flip. In Lugh, the system did flip. Players turned out early on in mass numbers to test this, trying to flip Lugh from the Federation into an independent star system under the Crimson party. This was accomplished, and Lugh is currently an independent star system as the Federation backed down. Anytime you do a mission, it pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party. So even if you play solo, you can impact global politics.  What this game does not do is give you a set path. You'll load up the game, you'll have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the game, and then you'll be dropped into a dock in star system LHS 3447. You wont get a quest prompt, the game wont say 'Hey, go here and do this!'. You'll be docked at a space station, and it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do. You need to find your own way. You'll blunder around and advance on your own terms.  When you start out, you should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work. But the exploration, the learning of how things work is a lot of the fun. This is an open world space game, and the way you experience it is something you'll dictate for yourself.  I can't recommend this game enough. The combat is really damn fun, there are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience. Trading and Exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooks, or watching TV shows.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Eurotruck Simulator - Motion Sickness Edition  The game is perfectly controllable with keyboard and mouse, just make sure to change the default setting, which are useless. This guide helped me a lot:  - Change the mouse x axis from roll to yaw - Set Q/E to roll left/right - Set W/S/A/D to up/down/left/right thrusters - Set R/F to forward/reverse thrusters - Set your mouse wheel to control speed; what I mean by this is to click in the 'increase throttle' binding box and roll the mouse wheel up, and do the same with 'decrease throttle' and roll your mouse wheel down. - Set speed increments to 25%. You'll never need more fine grain control than that. (I also set shift/ctrl as secondary binds for these)",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,  From Cynical Skepticism Blooms Humbling Immersion ,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"So, this game, guys. This game is very special. There are a lot of opinions about it. There are many people that play this a lot, yet at the same time have a lot of complaints. Serious gamers that have played 1000+ hours have negative reviews up.   Some of these folks trash this game to high heaven online yet fire it up every day. They do that because, despite the issues they have with it, they love it. They love serious games. They love space sims. They complain about it with good reason. They want it to be better. The truth is, this game has grand potential, but is already a massive, lumbering giant. It has delivered on promises that no other game has even bothered to attempt. The ones that have promised the features that Elite already has have failed (they shall not be named), or are in development (Star Citizen).  If you're a guy like me, that has been gaming since the 80's, that is passionate about games as a hobby or maybe something more. You have a real-♥♥♥ life and a real-♥♥♥ job, you don't post online much, you don't care to involve yourself in mudslinging on the 'net, but just want to play a great game. Listen. Check this thing out.  This game is The Game of Games. I don't mean it is a collection of mini-games. Although, some would argue that. When you get an attempt to pull you out of warp. When you land at a base. When you're collecting salvage in space. When you're mining. When you're scanning planets. When you're scanning ship wakes. When you're dogfighting. When you're comparing trade prices. When you're comparing ships or modules. When you're managing your power distribution. When you're approaching your warp destination. Etc...  Except, look. The common criticism is that old chestnut 'mile wide and inch deep'. I seriously disagree with that. Do you want play a game as Mal Reynolds or Han Solo? Many games claim 'be the next Han Solo'. THIS GAME DOES THAT. And it does it better than anything else on the market. Flying your ship feels so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Everything that surrounds that adds to the experience that you are a lone and powerless privateer in space. You can align with anyone you wish or no one at all. You can be a legit merchant or smuggle under the radar. And everything in between.   Another criticism is the game is 'grindy'. Well, if you want to farm faction rep or keep incrementing your credits and play the game like you're at a casino, sure it is. This game is an MMO. It doesn't really feel like it at first, but it qualifies as one. People will play it like an MMO, then complain about their MMO experience. Any game with no definite start or end has grinding. You watch the numbers go up. Look, this game is about the experience. It's about the sound of your engine whirring down, it's about feeling the pull of the star as you pop out of hyperspace, it's about the reflection of that giant moon in the grit on your windshield. You can play it however you want. It accomodates you no matter what you decide to do. It has a steep learning curve. It doesn't treat you like a baby. There are a lot of fantastic videos and a vibrant community that is ever-growing. Half the fun of this game is the discovery and the other half is the space privateer experience. You're the Cmdr. This is a game about piloting your own ship in a vast uncaring society, in an even vaster? uncaring galaxy. It's not about doing guild accounting like EVE, or leveling up RPG-style.  The game tries to give you an accurate, to-scale representation of the Milky Way. And well, it succeeds. There is a Galaxy Map in this game. You are a smart person that can at least understand how big our galaxy is. But you need to look at this map, you need to zoom in and out. It will make you go 'wooooooow'. (Maybe more of a Tim &amp; Eric 'bbwwwaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh'). Every time. It still does for me.   Your ship can only jump a few light years at a time. Sometimes, to get to a destination, you'll have to make a few jumps. Do some space truckin'. This can get boring. You don't really have to. The game itself doesn't make you. But you probably should at some point. You're gonna be cruisin' on a space highway. You're gonna pop out next to a white dwarf and really need to pull up and get out of the way before you overheat and/or get too close to the pull and yank you out into normal space. This space truckin' part of the game is par for the course when you have a GALAXY-SCALE area you can travel. Journeys to the center of the galaxy have been pretty well-documented, even if the collective population of players hasn't even discovered a dent of what's out there.  This game is full of moments you make on your own. Full of 'emergent storytelling' that I have shared with friends on more than one occaision. That's what makes this interesting. Narrowly avoiding federal scans and evading their grasp by a hair on that tough, pirate-wrought run. Finding yourself dogfighting in the ice chunks of a massive ring around a gas giant in a triple-star system. The game is what you make of it.   Elite is a game that does a little of everything you could ask for in a space sim set 1,300 years or so in the future. It's not perfect. But it's damn near close. It will keep approaching that limit. Again....there has never been another game like it.   Now, I don't know if the game has more unique stars &amp; planets in it than what I've seen. It has a lot, but I don't think it has quasars, pulsars, etc. But I haven't gone very far. You can land on planets. Most are just rocky bodies. Don't get me wrong, the galaxy is already full of amazing destinations and vistas. Later on, Frontier will add the ability to rove around on Earth-like planets, Venus-like, etc. The galaxy will constantly be added to and reworked. And, stuff like multi-crew ships, and aliens? are coming. Alien wrecks have already been found. Interesting. Ya.  This is a game in living development. It has seriously improved since initial release it countless ways. It is NOT an Early Access title. Far from it. Frontier Developments is not a two-horse studio. They have a proven track record, with capitol behind them, and seriously passionate people. They love space sims. They also love roller coaster games. Hey, Planet Coaster will sell. If this enables them to achieve their dreams they have with Elite, I am all for that. They have long term plans for this game and they have already delivered on their roadmap.  My personal criticisms, that will be addressed sooner or later, is sometimes you have to go to external databases on the internet to get some info. I don't like leaving the game for this. That's always a bad look. Also, The bases, beautiful as they are, have little signs of life. We are led to believe most bases are a big hub of activity but right now they still appear a bit lifeless. Common criticism.  Elite is as relaxing and zen-like, as it is challenging and gut-wrenching. The presentation is second to none. This is not a game for everyone, but there is a certain appeal to it that even non-gamers can appreciate. This is a game for discerning adults. I'm not saying kids can't play it. But, it's for people that know what they want, and are looking for a deep experience even if they can't dump 1000 hours into a game. It doesn't really lend itself to playing it all the time every day, at least for me. But for a good chunk of hours every so often. This is the type of game that you could play for the rest of your life in small chunks. It will keep getting better all the time. It's not even my favorite game (it's up there). But...in some ways it's a little more than a game, if you're willing to take the plunge, it's the best 'space experience' out there.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Edit: I would suggest that anyone who wants to get Elite Dangerous, but isn't in a hurry to buy it, to wait for the expansion Horizons. The expansion will cost 40 Euros, but come with the full elite dangeorus game + the expansion Horizons. The regular game will only unlock when the expansion is released, so no point in preordering (unless you already have elite dangerous and want the 10 Euro discount off horizon).  Definitely don't buy this. I did.   Day 0: I buy the game at 10 PM sunday night. My initial plan was to download it and just stay up all night playing it. I managed to convince myself to sleep and wake up early.  Day 1: I wake up at 3:30 AM way too excited to play this game. I launched it and thought 'What the ♥♥♥♥... how do I even spaceship...' a few minutes later I figured out the controls and set off exploring the solar system I was in, I opened up my galaxy map and looked around and saw endless possibilites.   I picked a far off solar system and plotted a course. Each solar system was as spectacular as the previous ones.  I look up and realize it is getting dark. 13 hours have gone by. Wait didn't I have class...  Day 2: Wake up at 9 AM. I started it up again and I had told myself that I would only play it for a couple hours, 7 hours later I made my way to a station to refuel, repair and get off.   Then some random guy invited me to his Wing and we started flying around collecting bounties. He's explaining things I had no idea I could do and which upgrades to get for my ship. I looked at my clock again and 5 hours had past...  Day 3: Now I'm writing this after my third day of playing. I managed to stop playing long enough to do the 5 hours of homework I had put off so I could play more. Do you see how much time I've played?! In three days, 72 hours, I have played 45.4 hours. I've slept 5 hours each night just so I could play more. That means I've spent 73% of the last three days sitting on my ♥♥♥ playing this game. The other 27% was probably spent eating and watching videos about elite dangerous. If that wasn't enough I got obsessed with flight sticks so I just bought myself a HOTA... Don't buy this game, you will get addicted and have way too much fun.",1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Elite Dangerous is a game of  massive scope and ambition.  The game consists of over 400 billion star systems to explore, each consisting of various planets, space stations and trade stations. Such an enormous game raises concerns that the universe may just be a huge, empty and dull skybox. With Elite Dangerous, this is not the case and with the planned future expansions, this title can only become more enriched with content as time passes.    So the universe is massive, but what is the objective?   Simply put, whatever you want it to be. Elite Dangerous refuses to hold your hand and push you in a direction, instead, you begin in a hanger, with your trusty Sidewinder spaceship and you simply decide what you want to do. There is a tutorial for the game, although, this acted as more a practice scenerio to learn the buttons and adapt your control schemes opposed to a lesson on how to play the game, but it's an appropriate tone that is continued beyond the tutorial.   Upon starting the game, you'll be seated in your Sidewinder. You have a few options here. You can:    ...take a leap of faith, set out into the universe and explore.    ...view the galaxy maps, locate trade routes and set about transporting goods in return for both reputation and currency.    ...upgrade your ship into a war hungry killing mission and set out to become a pirate, destroying other ships and claiming their loot for yourself. This will put a bounty on your head, and stolen goods will require you to sneak the cargo in through secruity to be sold on the black market.   ...set out in search for wanted criminals, destroy them and collect their bounties. Essentially making the universe a safer place.   ...seek out asteroids and collect resources through minning. You can either place these in a refinery or sell them on the market.    ...complete special missions located at bulletin boards at space stations. Each station contains unique missions to complete and often reward sizable rewards.  It's an open universe, free for you to do as you wish and create your own experiences. No two players will have seen the same worlds nor' have the same stories to tell. This is very much about you making your own objectives and forging a path in this enormous playground.   After collecting money, what can I do with it?   Two options. Purchase additional ships at space stations, each of which will have different stock and models available, or upgrade your existing ship with new weapons, cargo containers, radar sensors, power supplies, thursters, heat sinks and so on. There's a great wealth of custimization here, more of which will come later in future expansions.    What are a few of your experiences with the game?   Within the first few hours of playing the game, I immediately went into exploration mode. After blasting through the universe in hyperdrive mode, I was immediately pulled right in towards a gigantic sun, struggling to pull away from it's force. My heat warnings went off the scale and my components in the ship began to melt. My first ever death was the result of a small burn. Yeah...  Hm... How about the time when I detected a strong unidentified signal on my radar, so I swopped down, excited at the possibility of free cargo when I was immediately surrounding by a swarm of giant commander ships, those of which demanded my cargo in exchange for letting me escape with my live and vessal. At this point, my only option was to stall them whilst my hyperdrive charged. Just as they opened fire... VROOOOOM ZAP off I went flying through the galaxies.   Perhaps this one. The first time I located some illegal goods, worth over 50'000. Jackpot! All I had to do now was nurse the cargo home, sneak it past secruity and sell it on the black market. So as I arrived to the station, turning off all my engines and allowing the heat signature to drop before coasting past the secruity, just five feet from the entrance to the dock, I accidently hit the turbo button and flew into the station, flying to the back and into the wall. Yup. Good thing there wasn't anyone around to witness that... except the fifteen or so players currently docking at the time. But we'll just wash over that.     Faults with the game?   This is just a disclaimer for those who aren't aware at the moment.  No, you cannot land on planets or walk around outside your ship at the moment. Both of these were announced as planned DLC back in 2013 and should be expected to arrive sometime in the near future.  The details for this will be full 1:1 scale planets with life, cities, mountains, buggies, animals and varied atmospheres. For details on this, you can check out their YouTube channel and/or website for full details on these planned features.    Bugs, problems?   Just one from my own experience:    Whilst playing online and flying near huge amounts of players, planets or stars, the frame rate does drop about 60%. I can average about 80FPS with my GTX 760, but occasionally is does drop down to below 40. Minor issue, but worth noting.    Do you recomend the game?   It depends. If you fully acknowledge the game is entirely designed around the principle of players developing their own experiences and objects; that the game is challenging and requires a sizable amount of time to be invested; then yes, I would recommend it. Ultimately, you have to make your own decisions based on reviews, screenshots and videos.   I personally am not a huge space guru. The only other space-like game I've ever invested time into is Space Engineers, but this game, just days after playing it, ended with me purchasing a joystick, specifically for this game. It's definitely worth the money as it is, and it's only going to get better as more content is released.   Pros:     Good graphics   Good attention to detail   Huge scope and exploration value   Various playstyles and roles   Well optimized   Perhaps most important; passionate and dedicated developers   Cons:     Occasional frame-drops   Planet landing DLC and ability to walk around freely hasn't yet been implemented   Additional Notes:   I may have missed a few points out throughout this review, so any questions regarding the game or the content in the review, please feel free to comment in response to this review and I'll respond as soon as possible. :)  ",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I’ve heard it said that Elite Dangerous has no soul.  But I’m here to tell you that it does. I know, because I found it.  At first I doubted it, too. I mean, sure, from the time I climbed into my starting Sidey, strapped the shoulder harnesses on and flew out of that first Coriolis, I’ll admit it; I was blown away by the visuals. And the sound, too. Isn’t everybody? It really was very magnificent. But where was the game? What was I supposed to do? It wasn’t obvious. Just the opposite in fact. Space was black as the bottom of a coal bucket and endlessly, impossibly huge. Where were all the amazing sci-fi staples, such as neon colored nebula that were so bright they lit the screen with their pretty colors? There were no quest markers to tell me where to go. No guideposts, no “attaboy!” taps on the shoulder every thirty seconds for having not died, or successfully left the airlock, or some other trivial activity.  My screen didn’t start magically popping with messages and tutorials and information about such and such quests that were suddenly available. I was left alone to figure out things, and what became apparent pretty quickly was that I wasn’t ever going to even make enough money to get to the next ship up, much less be the ruler of the universe at some near point in the future. I flew into the hotspots where a great deal of the game’s combat takes place, or so I gathered at the time. I engaged hostiles with my pitiful kpew kpew lasers in combat inspired more by a surrealistic take on WWI aerial combat than anything resembling hard science fiction; the Sideys engines roared and grumbled, and when I banked to come about to keep track of an enemy, it sounded and felt like the rivets in the floor panels were struggling to fly apart under the stress of the manoeuvre. Everything happened at point blank range.  Still no pop-ups telling me what to do.  I struggled with landing, and when in stations I visited various mission bulletin boards that held a bewildering array of missions that if I happened to be qualified to accept in the first place paid peanuts and were very unclear about how to accomplish, and most spoke of distances far greater than my starter ship could even reasonably be expected to jump.  I worked with the game, struggling to learn its mechanics and features, but felt little sense of progress. I had fun and felt like I got my money’s worth...but after the initial amazement over the game’s visuals and sound wore off, I slowly began to lose interest. I felt like after I visited one Resource Extraction Site I had seen them all. The same for the 2-4 station models. The “world” was vast, but lacked personality, a reason to explore its contours and borders.  It seemed like those who claimed the game had no soul were right after all...  And then on one cold, boring day in December, Horizons released and I decided to pick it up and give the game another chance. I landed on airless worlds that were as rugged as they were beautiful, deploying my SRV like a futuristic 4-wheeler and exploring everything, from mysterious downed satellites to rare and useful mineral deposits that could be used for crafting everything from ammo upgrades to jump boosts.  Suddenly, my interest was engaged and the story telling part of my brain kicked in; I was Han Solo, and my ship was my Millennium Falcon. I smuggled slaves, one step ahead of the law; I ran blockades, joined Power Play, learned how to survive unwanted PvP and began to define an identity within the game’s universe. For the first time I felt like even though I would never be the master of all I surveyed, the identity of my CMDR was enough. I joined a group of Intergalactic hippies and followed them for over two months to the very edge of the galaxy where we stood shoulder to shoulder as brothers and sisters and gazed into the abyss, the dark night between galaxies before us, the blazing golden band of the galaxy’s core running from horizon to horizon over our shoulders. Many of us had ships that were so beat up from the voyage out that there was little hope of making it home.  As I took a moment to contemplate the game, the scope and breadth of the galaxy I’d traversed for no better reason than to say I did it and to shake my fist in defiance at that strange, black alien sky, I finally realized that I had been wrong: Elite Dangerous does have a soul...but it is cold and austere, a chill wind that blows through your center when you’ve been pushed to the point where you feel you’re made of glass and will surely break. It will only reveal itself to you when the immensity of the game finally, crushingly sinks into your bones.  Oh yes, Elite does indeed have a soul, but it’s not for everybody. It is only for those who persevere, those who adapt, survive and prevail against all odds. For those of you who would shake your fists at the sky and shout the devil down from the arch of time, I salute you, for you too are Elite.  o7",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Spent 45 minutes figuring out how to dock. 11/10 would furiously google ♥♥♥♥ again.   In all seriousness though, this game has a bit of a learning curve. Not a huge one, but just enough to confuse someone who's new to the game. All in all, this is a pretty good game. However, I do take issue with having to pay actual money to get some in game items like skins for your ship.   Pros:    Great graphics   Lightweight. Runs just fine on my laptop.   Seriously fun   Multiplayer is great   The world is.... huge. It makes Skryim look like your backyard.    The UI is fantastic. You can look left or right in your cockpit to see different menus. It's not awkward at all and works very well.    Surprisingly small download   Very well made. I'm yet to find any bugs or glitches.   Fantastic soundtrack   The quests are interesting  Cons:   Somewhat of a learning curve. Nothing a few minutes of searching the wiki can't handle though.    The quests are a little limited   On the topic of quests again, there are a few quests like, 'Find and kill 2 trader vessels'. This would normally be ok with me, except for the fact that it's just so damn hard to find certain classes of ships out there in the galaxy. You can spend a half hour searching and still not find one.    It's easy to get lost. Then again, I suppose that comes with the territory if you're playing a game with a map of this magnitude.   Verdict: If you like space games, then this is right up your alley. For people who have little to no experience with space games like this, it could be a little confusing. Really though, this game is fantastic.  ",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Greetings (future) sailors.  Having played this 'game' for 882 hours according to steam (add to that my horizons gameplay when it was a stand-alone game = 148 hours) that's for 1 year of space faring. I felt somewhat obliged to write a review.  First off, quit steam and go to  https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/  because every thumbs up review gets downvoted making steam reviews pretty worthless. It's not even a way to say 'hey, i like your review, here, have an upvote!' no, it's more like: 'oh you like the game? well screw you then!' that just depresses me.  If you're still here, (seriously, go to reddit) I'll tell some things why i spend at least 1.5 hours a day in this 'game'.  You get a starter ship, the sidewinder. and 1.000 credits (heard some other things on the starter kit, but I'll discuss how things went when i started.) and then... whatever your heart desires. (would advise you to go away from the starter area, some folks seem to like it killing people in about 2-3 shots and brag about it, don't ask why, that's beyond me. Fortunately there's a player group called Adle's Armada to defend new players.) Is someone going to hold my hand? No. you're on your own. (or ask someone in local chat, mostly you get helped out)  I spend some good 5 hours to have a control configuration that pleases me mostly. (still not all too happy about some functions) after that you'll spend quite some time getting a better ship (missions, bounty hunting, trading... to name a few most people do early on) JUST DON'T MAKE IT A RACE TO THE BIGGEST, BADDEST looking ship (anaconda, imperial cutter, federal corvette) after all that time i don't even have those. and tell you what, the people who have a 'conda in the first 3 weeks they own the game, can be found easily: click on 'show negative reviews only'. Really, play for fun, not for credits.   There still are things that need work (like combat logging, reducing instancing problems, ...) overall it's a great game, very complex. A real challenge to master well.  Grindy? I don't really seem to have a problem with it. make up achievable goals in your near future, like: 'right, 80k credits for an adder, then I'll ENJOY some trading, with the money that comes WITH it I'll save up to buy a decent looking bounty hunter and get out of imperial space to work on utopia.   Lack of content. euhm... sure... I guess. But i make my own content so that's again no issue for me.  One of the biggest gems about this game is the community, a mature one. I meet more people married and/or have kids than I find 12 year olds whining about whatever negative comes to mind... A portion of those people's kids have kids! A community that helps others out, one that inspires others through role-play.   If you have questions for me, please do ask.   Safe travels sailors!

359320,Elite Dangerous,Buy No Man's Sky Play 2 hours Ask for refund Buy Elite Dangerous Thank me,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous," DON'T buy this game if:     You want a deep 4X-style game with complex mechanics or economy    You want a heavy story with lots of lore    You want a rich multiplayer experience    DO buy this game if:     You want to play Euro Truck Simulator on steroids    You enjoy dogfighting and collecting bounties/loot to upgrade your ship    You want a space game that has great controls, great audio/visuals, and generally captures the feeling of spaceflight very well   I bought this game fully knowing what to expect after reading the steam reviews, and I'm addicted to it now. This will probably keep me busy for a long time.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"With every update, Elite Dangerous begins to feel more like a game. Cost aside, Horizons is crucial for the full experience. Please remember that Frontier do not have any publishers, and mainly rely on our purchases to continue developement for such an ambitious game. The top negative review rambles on about how horrible of a company Frontier is with such biased and misinterpreted sources, and from following this game's development for nearly two years, I can assure you that Frontier is far from such a company.   David Braben (CEO) treats this game as a passion project, and basing from interviews and livestreams with him speaking to the community, it is clear how trully passionate he is about the future of this game. David Braben, just like us, is a huge space-sim fan; as every update rolls out, we the community become very excited, and David Braben is just as excited as we are. The game is in good hands.  Oh yeah, next update has aliens. Ayy lmao.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Seems a lot of the negative reviews deal with people sucking at playing the game, complaining about steep learning curves and such. Took me all of 30 minutes to get a handle on the controls (mouse and keyboard, remapped throttle to mouse 4 and 5). That was 30 minutes going through the tutorials and watching the videos recommended (with links) in the game. Piece of cake after that. Haven't missed a landing or take off yet. Playing solo for now, as I know how space sims online usually end up. It's quite fun. Tons to do. An unbelievalbly large galaxy to explore. You're limited only by your imagination. No hand holding here.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Yes, I recomend this game. Most people who don't recomend say that the game is 'Boring,' 'Grindy,' etc. It can be, if you make it that way. E:D will be how you play it. There is no set story, there is no hand-holding (unless a buddy of your's is willing to do that, but the game sure won't), the game simply tells you: 'Here's a loaned Sidewinder and 1,000 credits. Do the rest yourself.' That's it. All the rest is by yourself. If you want to rush the biggest ship, go right on ahead. Fair warining: You will get incrediably bored, incrediably fast. Instead, have fun.   Find something you like doing. If you like the constant rush of combat, try becoming a Mercenary, fighting for one (or maybe both) sides in Conflict Zones, or by wiping the scum of pirates clean from the void we call space, or perhaps become a pirate yourself. Maybe you will find your calling in the rather tranquill profession of mining (sit back, start playing some music, and enjoy), maybe you can find some enjoyment in trading (kudos to you if you do, can't stand it myself, lol), or try treking out into the vastness of our Milky Way Galaxy, finding planets that you can finialy and rightfuly write 'Lol, first' on. Theres so much to do. And if you get bored of one thing, try something else.  The point is this:    Don't play to win. Play to have fun. Find what you like, and if you get bored, try something else.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I want to address the reviews. There's a very clear pattern here. 0hrs - 50hrs are negative, 50-200 are positive, and 200+ are negative. I want to say I completely agree with these reviews, I hated the game until I hit 30 hours, and I see how there isn't enough content for 200+ hours. (I'll try to keep this as short as possible.)  For starters, this game appeals to a VERY small amount of people. You have to be OBSESSED with sci-fi, you have to be okay with grinding, and you have to be okay with sitting around doing nothing for a few mins while youre traveling.   Now that we've got that out of the way, the learning curve for this game is very very steep. You will be dying a LOT when you begin the game, and you won't really find much to do when you first start off. This is why the 0-50hr reviews are mostly negative. However, watching videos and getting help from experienced people certainly helps a bunch.   After you start to understand how the game works and the credits start rolling in, that's where the game truly shines. This golden 10 hour period when things finally click is the best time in the game. It's where you have so many choices and so many things to do that it becomes overwhelming. The 50-150/200hr is where you'll have the most fun.  So to sum it all up, if you LOVE space and sci-fi, if you're okay with a bit of a grind, and if you're okay with nothing happening for a while as you travel, you'll love this game. It's essentially a walking simulator in space with lots of combat, trading, exploration, and politics.   If you're not looking for anything that'll last you too too long (maybe 100-200 hours) definitley pick this game up ASAP. Updates are still rolling in. See you in space, pilots!   EDIT: 250+ hours and I'm finally tired of this game. Take from that what you will.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Buy it, Give the learning curve a chance, and you will have one of the coolest space sims ever.  For Mouse and Keyboard users.  - Change the mouse x axis from roll to yaw - Set Q/E to roll left/right - Set W/S/A/D to up/down/left/right thrusters - Set R/F to forward/reverse thrusters - Set your mouse wheel to control speed; what I mean by this is to click in the 'increase throttle' binding box and roll the mouse wheel up, and do the same with 'decrease throttle' and roll your mouse wheel down. - Set speed increments to 25%.   This helped me a LOT!",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I had no idea this game existed until I saw it in my recommended list on STEAM. I watched some gameplay videos and thought it looked amazing so I bought it and I absolutely adore it. Easily one of the top 3 PC games released this year in my opinion, along with Pillars of Eternity and GTA V.  The 'MMO' tag is a little misleading, it's not really an MMO. There are three modes of play; Solo (where the world is populated by AI's), Open (where the world is populated by AI's and other players) and Private (where you and specific friends play together). The game itself is mind-bogglingly enormous, with 400 billion star systems. If you wanted to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other it would literally take you days or even weeks (I'm not sure, I've never tried). It's a sandbox; there's no story, you simply do whatever you want to do, be it exploring the vast amount of solar systems and finding cool stuff like giant (or tiny) stars, black holes, interesting sequences of planets and so on, or trading (which is mind numbingly boring, as in any game, but makes a hell of a lot of money), bounty hunting which is a lot of fun and will net you a respectable amount of cash, or being a dirty pirate and criminal.  Frontier will be adding all kinds of new features to the game in the future, such as the ability to land on planets, walk in stations, more ships and I even hear they'll be adding alien races. If you're the kind of gamer that enjoys games that don't hold your hand and require to put a little work in before you start getting something back out, and if you enjoy flight sims (especially space sims) then I'd say this is a game for you. If you're from the spoiled brat Call of Duty generation and anything more complicated than pointing your gun with the mouse and clicking the left mouse button to fire is too much information for your brain to process then I wouldn't recommend it at all. It can be quite complicated at times and I've put around 50 hours in to it so far and I still make mistakes and learn new stuff every day.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"It's Elite, what else is there to say? The sequel to David Braben's seminal space sim classic is finally here, and it's fantastic! Having been an early alpha backer with several dozen hours of flight time logged, I thought I'd give my two cents for those considering buying.  After years (decades!) of waiting, the day that fans never thought they'd see has finally arrived, we have a new Elite game that lives up to the promise of the 1984 original but with all the added graphics and gameplay that modern technology affords us. Elite Dangerous successfully recaptures the spirit of the 1984 original while adding the enhancements of the pantheon of great space sims both big and small that have been released in recent years, from big names like Wing Commander: Privateer and the X Series, and recent indie games like Paragon and Rodina.  So, what is there to game? Strapped into a shiny new ship the player is thrust into a truly massive procedural galaxy, able to hunt, mine and explore, facing off against or working with both other players and the A.I., striving to upgrade their ship with awesome new weapons or buy their way into more powerful craft. All in all it's an enthralling experience, and the meat of the game, from the beautful graphics and wonderful sound effects and music, to the silky smooth handling and personality of the ships and weapons comes together beautifully.  There are still kinks to be worked out of course, some areas of the gameplay seem like they still need to be fleshed out, and there are of course still bugs, but the devs seem to be doing a bang-up job of fixing the old girl up, and I have faith in their ability to continue to do so.  TL;DR; Awesome game Y/N? Hell yes!",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous," https://discord.gg/kzPQYdN   This is by far the best game ever. It has helped me tremendously through depression and I would say it did give me a reason not to give up on life since this community is by far the nicest ever. From sdc members who griefe the game to the new folks in sidewinders, you will see everything. From a whole recreation of the galaxy to planetary bases this game does it all. The support team is by far the best ever and i cant thank you guys enough for saving my ship so many times due to some very unlucky glitches. Their response is as said, under 72 hours and they are so nice! I have met so many CMDRs in space and on discord, and none each one of them has their own playstyle. It is by far the best example of what the futur awaits us. This is more than a game to me. In my case, this game has saved me from suicide and I dont know alot of games that can achieve this. Thanks to everyone involved in the community, if everyone could have a bite of what i have experienced in this game, there would be no wars. So if you see this review, hope in, you can do so many things! I have played so much and I still dont see me stopping anytime soon. Sometimes when i travel around the galaxy for days i mix while flying because why not! This is truly a masterpiece, and the best part is its probably never going to be done since the devs are like the players, we always need more!   TDLR: this game is QUALITY and HUGE QUANTITY 10/10 + 1 point for saving my life and making me go through my severe depression so overall 11/10  The ♥♥♥♥ posting is real on here. For all those not aware I HAVE A MEDICAL BILL. Stop being ♥♥♥♥ posters and stop starting ♥♥♥♥. I was just here to say that this game helped me and still is. Thats it.

Polite people are prohibited and furries will be purged and burnt alive. If you see my remains dont ask then, I fit in. Porn of course is the only subject we talk about between cmdrs and man do we ♥♥♥♥ing Love that ♥♥♥♥. Maybe porn could help with my depression dont you think?

359320,Elite Dangerous,"This is amazing. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve, it's a game that respects its players. Once you learn a bit of the game, you will be amazed by this superb universe. Definitely buy. Sure, if you're looking for EVE Online you'll be dissapointed. Can't group up yet in an MMO sense of things (healer, tank etc.) You can trade, explore, fight. That's about it. It's a vast universe with lots of systems to explore, lots of quests (from delivering cargo to fighting pirates or attacking traders). You can play it solo or online with other players. The game looks stunning, definitely the best space sim I've ever played. SOme players are complaining about 'grinding'. Well, I guess we all got a bit too used to WoW or such other MMOs. Let's run through a few instances, then a few raids, gear up in 2 days, yay, content exhausted. Here you must upgrade your ships or buy new ones. And it takes time, if you're new to this game and don't know how to make credits. That's your 'grinding'. I stick to my saying. If you're into space sims, buy this game. You won't regret it.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"This is the first time I am writing a game review, mainly because I thought some of the reviews that don't recommend the game are a little misleading. I think the game is fantastic. Great graphics and there is a good amount of stuff to do. I love the fact that the flying is very hands on, and complicated. You definitely want to watch some of the tutorials that are out there to help you get a grip on learning the game. Initially it took me loads of time to dock my ship, but I am getting better and am cutting that down to 5 minutes. Love it. There are some things that I find could use improvement - the trade tab is a little confusing and its not easy to keep track of what to buy and sell where and when. - I am not happy with the systems map. It shows you what's there, but it does't let you highlight any spot in the system and plug that spot into your navigational system to go there. That could be improved - It would help if there were an in-game encyclopedia (like the one in Total war for example) in order to look up what certain things mean/are good for etc.  Overall, I am really looking forward to playing this game and if you enjoyed wing commander, freelancer, or any other game of that type, you'll enjoy this too.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I'll be sharing my humorous mishaps and other encounters in my review.  -Smuggled 10 tons of space weed...on accident.  -Was smuggling cargo into a station, and then I got scanned. Out of panic, I floored my engine to try to scramble into the station, got fined for the cargo anyways, missed, slammed into the side of the station, and received another fine.  -Got stuck in the airlock of a station by flying sideways. Got blown up by the station, of course. And fined.  -Was busy in the Steam overlay, wasn't looking, and smashed headfirst into an outpost going about 350 M/s.  -In Eravate, a Sidewinder newbie decided to shoot at me near the station, so for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles I boosted into him in my Vulture. Launched him into oblivion and he proceeded to blow up. Received a 200 cr fine for Reckless Piloting, but I got a 600 cr Bounty for his destruction. Worth it. \o/  This game is very fun, to sum it up.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,  *Serious review at the end*,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Hello to all you future ELITE pilots, I bought this game after playing the original ELITE on commodore 64 and i could not stop playing it back in the late 70s or 80s.  When this game was advertised for steam i had it in my wishlist and became so impressed with the video footage, I knew this would be a game worth having being that i am a loyal ELITE fan.  This game has good graphics and sound on a average computer and my computer is a high end computer soi have everything set on ULTRA in the game settings and it runs very smoothly.  The sound is good on headphones but it is advised you play this game using a 360 gamepad or joystick being a space simulation.  There is many things you can do in this game depending on what you want to do such as bounty hunting or trading from planet to planet or discover new planets in billions of systems, as in ELITE the space is endless and for those who like to kill and kill more then this game is for you as in space nobody can hear anyone scream.  This game can be hard to start with as it has a big learning curve but for those who has never played the original before it can take a little while to get the hang of it, but given a little time and patience and a lot of trading and bounty hunting you will get the hang of it in no time and become one of the deadliest elite pilots and feared by everyone, there is training videos that comes with this game to help you fully understand the game better.  (Advice) I started out mostly trading to begin with as fighting in a basic sidewinder with no upgrades is a sure way to die quickly so avoid fighting until you get a better ship, You need to trade well to get the credits to buy a better ship and upgrade it with A4 parts.  I bought the Cobra MK III and fitted it out with the best of everything this will take some time but it is worth it in the end. as it is a all round ship good for fighting and trading until you have enough credits to buy a Asp or Lokon T7 trade ship which has a big cargo hold which means earning big money to end up buying a Python or Anaconda and fully fit it out.  With a Python i can visit all these star systems with no fear of having my ship smashed to atoms among the stars by any smart fly by night elite bounty hunter pilots  I advise all new pilots to start off playing in solo mode and not multiplayer mode as if you play in multiplayer mode in the beginning you will be hunted down by more advanced players in ELITE until you have a better fighter ship and gained some playing time.  Everything you do and achieve in solo mode won't be lost as it can be used in multiplayer mode, so build your ship up in solo then go into multiplayer with that ship then you will have a better chance of survival.  There is just one golden rule to remember BE PATIENT never rush it rome was not built in a day everything will turn out ok if you play this game right and always remember to keep enough credits back in reserve in case you get your butt kicked and have to replace your ship or sadly it will be back to the beginning with a sidewinder.  This is a game that is endless and will take months or even years to complete.  I have played nearly 1100 hours and i have only just about scratched the surface, it is the game i like most as it has challenges and good missions to complete.  The game comes with excellent advice on how to play it with videos for the newbie and it does take a lot of hard work to move up the ranks, this game is one of my top 3 games and i will play this game forever.  If you like space simulations with trading/bounty hunting then this game is for you without any doubt as you won't get tired of it as there is so much to do, there is improvements and extra's being added to this game and more is still being developed as we speak.  The downside to this game is that you have to buy the paint jobs for your ship with real money from the developer's site and they are not cheap so my advice is choose your paint job wisely.  I can't wait until there is DLC packs for this game and more gimballed weapons for your ships but i enjoy this game and i think it is money well spent and i am sure you will feel the same too.  So don't hang about buy it now and join the rest of us and become a pro ELITE pilot in ELITE DANGEROUS...happy hunting.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,Updated on April 6th 2015.   Introduction,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous, A Mixed Bag of Epic Proportions,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I am rewriting this review because my other one was kind of all over the place, and I wasn't quite satisfied with it. Unlike my previous one, I will use subcatagories this time to keep everything in check. With that said, let's get roiiiight into the REVIEWWWWWWW.  Now I came across this game after I was extremely infuriated with No Man's Sky, and I bought the PC version when it came out, so for those of you who bought it too, you know the struggle of not being able to run a game that has half decent graphics with a GTX 820 graphics card. (The content in the game wasn't even worthwhile either BTW.)  I was CRAVING a space sim, and then I came across this sweet little jem called Elite Dangerous.  -STORY-  As of right now, the game's lore is... Well it does have lore, and it's there but... I never really cared about it that much because it isn't a very big focus of the game. However I heard it does have a farily intriguing story. (If you put time into researching it.)  -GAMEPLAY-  So you start the game out as a lone pilot, who needs to make a living in the galaxy. You are given a small ship called the 'Sidewinder' as your starter, a couple laser cannons and... Nothing else. In order to build your way up the ranks as a pilot, as well as grab yourself a new shiny ship, you need to choose how you are going to make credits. (Credits i.e. the game's currency.) You can do this a variety of ways. Mining, smuggling/transporting, pirating, bounty hunting, or assist a waring faction doing battle in a conflict zone. The choice is completely up to you how you want to spend your time earning funds, just make sure you choose the right ship for the job.  Now let's go a bit more in depth to the gameplay elements. First off I just want to get mining out of the way. Straightforward and simple, just equip a mining laser on your ship, find an astroid belt and shoot at rocks, that's it.  But let's be real here, the aspect where the gameplay truly shines is the ship combat!   The dogfighting in this game is truely unique, and the difficulty exceeds once you start encountering different ships, and trying to figure out how to deal with them.  The combat in Elite Dangerous seems simple at first; Point, shoot, destroy, get a bounty voucher or get a bounty on yourself. And... it is. Early on fighting weaker enemies you may think the combat is a breeze... However once you start making your way up to better ships, and fighting stronger pilots, you will quickly figure out the combat in this game is no simple 'breeze'.  You will eventually encounter ships that will destroy you in mere seconds, like Pythons, Imperial Clippers, and the legendary Fer De Lance fighter, all of which will completely smoke you if you don't know your manouvers, or don't have a good enough ship. This game has a VERY steep learning curve for ship combat, and it is an absolute neccessity to learn your manouvers so you can stay in their blind spots for as long as possible, and avoid being blown out of the cosmos in 5 seconds. You also shouldn't be afraid to bail and warp out if you take too much damage, however if the enemy is faster than you, well... GOOD LUCK BUDDY.  You also have the ability to forward power to you different modules, like your engines and weapons. If you find your weapons are overheated, you can forward power to them to get a quick boost, same with your engines and shields. Also bear in mind that any damage taken will NOT just be to your hull, and will damage other parts of your ship. You power plant, warp drive, etc, they can all be damaged, so before you warp into another fight, make sure you check the health on your modules to make sure you're able to warp out of a fight in case of an emergency, or your thrusters don't malfunction and you are left completely imobile. Even your canopy can be destroyed, so FOR GOD SAKE UPGRADE YOUR EMERGENCY LIFE SUPPORT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE!!!  Also it's worth mentioning the game has a very in depth customization system, allowing you to procedurally upgrade your ship with more weapons, better armor, and various gadgets that allow you to scan targets for extra bounties, boost your shields, and even one that allows you to pull ships out of warp so you can attack them.  -GRAPHICS AND *smiles delightfully* ATMOSPHERE-  For god's sake the graphics and overall feel in this game are just badass. If you have read through any of the other positive reviews on this game chances are you have seen people complimenting on how awesome the atmosphere in this game is. To sum up some details for you:  -Canopy breaches cause the air to be sucked out of your ship and the glass to crack, all in awesome detail and causing the cockpit to go silent as if you are actually in the vaccum of space.  -Boosting causes the hull to creek and vibrate.  -When you enter a space station you literally feel like you JUST ENTERED A FRICKEN SPACE STATION.  There are many more suddle details I could list, but I want to hurry up so I can go back to playing Elite Dangerous before my mom yells at me for it being a school night.  ... Oh right and the graphics look good too. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  -JUST SOME MORE THINGS I WANT TO SAY-  Elite Dangerous is a great game, one of the funnest in my Steam Library in fact. I have had so many experiences in this game I have never experienced in any other game before, and it was pretty damn awesome. One experience just recently happened to me in fact (BTW The review is over now this is just me ranting on about how good this game is for another paragraph.)  So I was just flying around in hyperspace, looking for conflict zones to get some combat bond vouchers. (Pay really good BTW) I found one and I warped in, expecting to make some good money after a good ten minutes there. When I warped into the zone, I got a message from my computer saying: 'Capital Class Signature Detected' and at the time I was all like 'WTF does that mean.' Because I never got the message before.   All of the sudden I saw this huge black cloud emerging when I warped in, filled with some kind of blue lightning... Or something. Then this CRAZY HUGE ship began emerging from the cloud, along with some of the best audiowork I have ever heard in a video game before. It was loud, and it was scary. A Federal Battlecruiser just emerged from hyperspace into the battleground, and it was quite the entrance. It seemed to me (from the size of the thing, I looked on wiki it's 2 kilometers long) that it was some kind of boss event, and I was all like HELL FRICKEN YES!!! I joined the opposing faction, managed to figure out how to defeat the thing (I say defeat because you can't destroy it, it just retreats back into hyperspace BUT IT'S STILL COOL.) and I got an insane reward for my contribution. By far one of the best experiences I have had this year, in fact one of my best video game experiences of all time.  'B-b-b-b-but it's grindy!'  Who cares... BATTLECRUISERS!!!",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"So good I returned the copy I bought a week ago so that I could buy it and have it on steam. Great game definitely worth grabbing on steam if you haven't bought this already. I have a Saitek X-52 joystick and this game was practically made for it. You definitely want to have a joystick for this game because it works great with one with no need to configure the buttons. BUY THIS GAME! P.S. they have great customer support and very fast responses, got two responses in same day both giving me solutions to the questions I had about switching my game over to steam. I had to get a refund and rebuy it, but they had no problem with refunding me so I could move over to steam and I did not have to create a new account, just add the new steam key and I was gtg. I would of loved to have just gotten a key for steam without refundning and repurchasing but hey lifes not always fair and considering how good this game is I did not mind too much.",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"A wonderful and stunning space sim! You have the options to be a bounty hunter, trader, smuggler or a pirate! I got a little motion sickness at the beginning but when I learned how to control the ship it went away. It may seem a little hard at first but when you get into it and play the tutorials it's not that hard. I played the tutorial for like 1 hour before I felt like knew how to do everything. It's a really great game! I would recommend it!",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I had seen that this game had been released on steam. Never had I heard about an Elite game. So, I read a few reviews and they promised depth within this game that you yourself need to find. I took the risk and bought this game.  The first 10 or so hours I spent doing low risk carrier missions. I made a fair amount of money and travelled 10 different systems or so. I wanted to leave though. This was amazing! I was like a trader in star wars moving cargo between solar systems! If i dove a little into bounty hunting and stealing cargo floating in space and selling it on the black market. However, there was more that I wanted, and I still strive for this. I want my name permanantely on a planet. NO. A SOLAR SYSTEM. I want every planet to have my name on it.  I dreamt big. The nearest nebula. Or just one to see how far moving along the galaxy really is. I chose the pipe nebula. Using the money I had made from my first 10-12 hours, I bought a new ship, a few minor upgrades, and set off. I traveled ~500 light years to reach this nebula, and my name was not on a planet/solar system yet. One of the best parts about this begining journey to the pipe nebula, was only 20 light years out from finally reaching the nebula, I noticed its not just the same skybox placed for every single solar system. I could see the pipe nebula getting larger with every jump I made towards it. It was real. It was there.  I discovered this no more than 20 minutes ago. And armed with this new knowledge, I jumped into the galaxy map and looked at countless other nebulae. What one do I want to see!? Where do I want to go!? So, thinking this, I decided I will return back the 500 or so light years I travelled to the center of the milky way, back into the established space (Space stations and such), and go the exact opposite way and move towards the pilleads cluster, and from then on, move towards the horse head nebula. However, im conflicted to wheather or not I would prefer to move into the elephant's trunk nebula.  I have the entire Galaxy to explore, and endless stars to jump though. Just the fact that I can go to the center of the milky way is astonishing. The fact that I can move to the opposite end of it, just as awesome. I spent 8 or so hours moving 500 light years, and i look forward to many more with the hope that I will get my name on a planet. For now, im going to be a tourist. Then an explorer. If I get bored, a miner, trader, bounty hunter, renegade. Dont worry, I will send post cards.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous," First of all,  please note  : Whole of this review is only my   Opinion   about this game.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I...I can't make a dent.  61 hours into this game now has me writing my first review.  I keep bouncing through systems completing random hush hush missions that are considered illegal and mixing in bounty hunting with my Eagle (A fighter class ship (I love it)), yet no matter how far I go in our beautiful galaxy I truly go nowhere when I zoom out in the galaxy map.   Completing tons of missions for tons of systems with tons of consequences along with choices 'Do I stay loyal or take the extra cash' my decision could inspire an economic boom for one system yet create an economic bust for another.  Not all missions are 'Do this for us, we'll give you something in return' either, some systems are looking for donations if things are really bad there and if you're feeling generous (or just want the rep) you go find them what they're looking for (food, meds...) bring it back and get no money but a heaping pile of thank you.  Bounty hunting is awesome in my personal opinion, just scan, verify if wanted, light 'em up, rinse and repeat. Bounty hunting is especially fun with a wing (Group) of people, given the fact that at within a wing you can you voice comms (and it actually sounds like voice comms!)  That's basically all I've done for 61 hours and I know that isn't even a fraction of a fraction.  Well, I'm going to start playing again so chances are it won't be 61 hours anymore.  Thank you for reading.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"So, after about 500 hours of playtime (I had 250+ hours on Horizons before it became DLC on steam) I think I can make a more educated review on what I think of Elite: Dangerous.   I started the game about a year ago, mindlessley flying around space with no real direction to go in. This notion can confuse some people as then, there was not a clear objective, it was just you're in space so go do something. The primary directive for me or drive was to generate income and work my way up towards bigger and better ships, and I believe this applies to a majority of players. Before the engineers update however, missions were considered bland and repetitivem, with the only real ways to make money being long distance smuggling or large ship trading. For me, I didn't know what to do, and promptly left the game for nearly a year. I then came back to elite dangerous about 3 months before horizons, having an urge to give it a go. I also had a friend with me which in my opinion made the experience much more enjoyable as you had another person to explore or bounty hunt with.  When planetary landing came out, me and my friend were playing all day from 10am to 2am for about a month or two. I think you have to simply enjoy the fun in flying to a planet, gliding down to the surface, deploying your SRV's and then surveying the brilliant terrain laid before you. Flying through canyons, landing in huge craters and taking hours to cross with your SRV. The game did a fantastic job of giving you a scope of just how big these planets are, and there are millions to explore, which to me was great.  However, after months of us playing and repeating the same act of landing on planets, doing the occasional planetary base mission, we became quite bored with the game. This is a huge defining point for a lot of players. 'Endgame'. This is the stage where you have a comfortable sum of money in your account, you have tried every mission and done your fair amount of bounty hunting. What drive is there now to continue playing the game. For me and my friend there was none, and we were thoroughly dissapointed in the engineers update for a number of reasons: -We like many others did not like the random aspect to upgrades -It adds more grind to the already grindy game -It didn't feel like the wait was worth it However recentley I have gone back to the engineers and I am having a much better time. Frontier have definitley made mission boards much better and more understandable. Missions pre-update seemed broken, when stacking 10 missions only increased the rep of a faction by 1%. I believe that the engineers update tailors well for outfitting a smaller ship as you are able to collect materials much quicker and get to places a lot faster. Overall, I've had a brilliant time with this game, and I am thoroughly nostalgic towards the first time I landed on planets or explored a nebula. I really do hope frontier adds more content to planets but I think that engineers at it's core is a step in the right direction. For players who stop playing at end game, I have been there and have done so, however what kept me into the game was the brilliant feeling when exploring space and just marvelling at the brilliance of the graphics and sounds.  -Brilliant Graphics -Upcoming DLC which will hopefully make the game a lot more rich with content -Huge planets with amazing terrain that you can explore for hours -An extremely large and expansive game space which can occupy your entire day.  I'm glad that I discovered Elite and continued playing it and that's why I'd give it a reccomendation to those who would give it time. P.S. I know this review is all over the place, it's my first proper one kek",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I bought this game primarily to curb my anxiousness for No Man's Sky, and so far it's done a fantastic job. The first thing you want to know before you buy this is that there's a huge learning curve, so don't expect to login for the first time and go guns hot on the first thing you see. You won't know what you're doing, and you will die. People who complain that this game is too hard are simply people who don't care to learn how to play it; they can just stick with CoD as it is more suited for them.  Trading:  I think the trading system is nice. It's not easy to exploit and get way too much money, but it is simple once you take the time to get a grasp of it. On first glance is does look a little daunting looking at all the trade routes and the bright colors in your Galaxy Map, but really it's just simple economics: high supply = low demand and vice versa. Once you sit down and just read what's in front of you there's really nothing to be confused about.  Combat:  Getting into the combat in this game can be a little slow and you DEFINITELY want to play the tutorials and maybe even watch some videos on the web. Once you begin to understand how to get an advantage combining your thrusters and yaw roll/pitch together then it really becomes a lot of fun. I must say that winning my first battle felt like a real accomplishment.  Immersion/AI:  Okay so these two kind of go hand in hand in this game. Without the AI being as dynamic as it is this would simply be a boring game because the galaxy is so big you don't come across a huge amount of people that you actually interact with. Yeah you see them flying by in Supercruise but it's very unlikely that two people will end up in the same section of space unless they've already formed a group. So in order to create an immersive galaxy this game has very interactive AI. For example, my very first battle in space: I was in Supercruise (which is when you use your frame drive, or jump drive at lower speeds to travel inside the same solar system) and all of a sudden I had a warning flashing on my sensors that there was an 'Interdiction' or something to that effect. Essentially a low level criminal (fortunately, this was my first time in a firefight outside the tutorial) pulled me out of Supercruise and demanded my cargo. Of course, I was going to just give it to him, so I deployed my weapons and the fight started. About 3/4 of the way through the battle (at which point I already knew I was going to win) the Federal Police dropped in because they had noticed what was happening. They done a quick scan of my ship and I assume his as well, joined my side of the battle and then it was 3v1. Yeah it didn't last much longer. The combat requires your full attention though as you have to constantly reassess the situation and divert power between your shields/engine/weapons to keep the advantage.  Travel:  Of course, in a game boasting a massive galaxy with 400 billion star systems you need to have a way to get around, right? Right. Essentially traveling in this game is done either with your Supercruise or jumping to Hyperspace. They both use the same button, but will activate one or the other based on what you're doing. So if you don't have another system targeted then you will simply jump to Supercruise which will increase your speed so you can effectively travel to other space stations, events, and people within the system you're currently residing. To travel to another star system you enter your Galaxy map (there are a number of ways to do this but I personally like clicking middle mouse button to go to headview and looking at the section of my cockpit where my Nav Interface pops up. This is a very cool way to keep the game immersive even in your own ship), select the star system you want to travel to and select plot course. Then you line up with it on your sensors and bam, hyperspace. Very cool, and you absolutely feel like an explorer out there going to all the different star systems.  Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 8.5/10 (not a 9 or 10 just because there still are some confusing things that the game doesn't tell you about) Controls: 10/10 once you learn how to use them Replay Value: 9/10 as far as I can tell there isn't really a main mission so the game is designed to keep you interested. However, it does seem that the missions might get a little repetitive after a while, but don't they in every game?   I'm still mega-noob level in this game but I'm having a lot of fun nonetheless, and I haven't really played with anyone in a group. I'm sure it would be exponentially more awesome if you did.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Elite is one of my favorite games of all time. I’ve put many, many hours into it and the recent Engineers update will only increase the playability for me. That said, I cannot recommend this game to just anyone. It takes a certain type of person to enjoy Elite Dangerous and it’s a game of it’s own class. Anyone thinking about purchasing it needs to do the research before hand to make sure that this is a game that they will enjoy. I’ve put 500+ hours into this game and have never enjoyed a game as much as Elite.  I won’t describe what this game is about, because anyone considering buying this game already knows what Elite is, or can easily look up some gameplay. For anyone considering buying this game, here’s what you need to know.  This game will not hold your hand, and there is no storyline. There is so much content to this game and people often judge it harshly because they aren’t able to turn the content into something they can enjoy which is exactly why this game isn’t for everyone. This game is also grindy, there is no way around that. I enjoy the grind though. I turn it into something I can enjoy and that’s why I keep coming back to this game. A lot of people here who leave negative reviews state that the game is ruined with the Engineer update, but that’s hardly the case. Yes there are some small issues, but the amount of customization now is endless. The AI is also harder with the recent patch and definitely made the game a lot more difficult, and for some players, unplayable. For me it’s a lot more challenging now, but I can deal with it. I feel confident that Frontier will develop a compromise to balance the AI for all players and they have already begun taking some steps to doing so which is why I don’t think this will be an issue for very long.  Horizons is almost a must now. Just owning the base game will put you at a disadvantage and make the game a lot less fun. That is the biggest negative. I think proper design should have been implemented to allow non-horizon players to use some features of engineers since it is crucial to achieving the best possible ship. Elite will have many more updates that will probably be just as controversial as Engineers, but undoubtedly make the game better. People judge this game too harshly because the game isn’t going in the direction they want it to go in. You have the right to be unhappy, and there are certainly changes that I am not happy with, but this is just a videogame after all.  I really can’t stress enough how important it is that you know what you are buying. If you understand what Elite Dangerous is and isn’t, and you like what you see, then I can absolutely recommend this game to you. Any game that can give me one hour of gameplay for every dollar is worth it to me, and Elite has well passed that. This game truly is amazing, you just have to be able to turn it into something that is amazing.  ",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"E:D is ridiculously underrated. It has evolved into something truly special with v.2.1 and 2.2 soon to release. Now is the time to jump in if you've been on the fence... or feel burned by the empty promise of No Man's Sky.   There is an unforutnately widespread perception that E:D is 'vast but shallow'. It's not shallow. (It *is* vast.) This is most likely due to the fact that many players seriously underestimate the learning curve. It's steep. E:D requires a real committment to learn. Or put another way -- you can learn the simple basics farily quickly. But learning the rest of the skills, procedures, tactics that turn E:D into a fantastic experience takes some time. It's not a game you can just jump into and expect to enjoy off the bat.   If you're willing to put in the effort to learn -- you will be rewarded. Amazing game.",1,1

But with a bit of determination, a player can soon wield a fleet scattered all over the galaxy.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Alright lets talk about the pros of the game: -Good Community -Responsible Developers -Quickly respond and fix your problem when you encounter bugs and glitches. -Open World -Good Graphics for a space game. Especially the upcoming neutron star revamped!!! :DD -Not Pay2Win -Great Sound Effect and Music. Hope that add more tho. -So far i havent seen any hackers. -Frontier gave us a complete game and add content after that, instead of trying to pack all the planned content and delay the full game release like star citizen (My opinion, dont flame me please) -Passenger Mission! -They updated the Neutron stars!!! Mind Blown by the sight. -New Player Power! :D (tho i'm not a powerplayer) -2.2 improved my performance somehow, used to stutter in station every fkin time but now  no more even on different type of station with new skin...no stutter! Good sign! Good Thing! -Federal Corvette Paintjobs finally! Oh not to mention my favourite chirstmas tree booblehead!  Meh: -Awesome Lore but require research on the internet to know more. -Background Simulation -Powerplay -Time Consuming not suitable for casual gamers, depends on how you treat the game, you want big ship? You have to invest some time in this game. -Instance problem! Well i can't blame them tho.  Cons: -Difficult NPC - GRIND FEAST (used to but not now) -Very boring if you have to wait 15 mins to reach a destination and betweern that time there's nothing to do in the game. -Very sintgy on Hyperspace Jump Range (edit: not anymore) -Combat Logging ( player force quit the game while he's in a PvP fight) -Long Searching in CQC. :( -Pirating in this game is dead. -Exploration is good but not good enough. -Lack of planetary surface activity.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"For newbies curious about the game I've made a guide at the bottom of this review as (to much irritation and annoyment) all the 'guides' are videos and it doesn't cover everything you should start out knowing.  Elite: Dangerous is an amazing space simulator. Your hand isn't held. You decide what you want to do and you create your own story and adventure. Some reviews will tell you that there isn't much to do and in a sense it's true. There are only a few things. You can be an explorer and just simply go from station to station exploring areas and broadening your database and mind with breathtaking visuals throughout an immensely huge galaxy. You could become a pirate and hunt down cargo to potentially gain lots of good loot to sell and become rich. You could become a trader; risk your life transporting legal and /or illegal goods from one station to the next. Or you could become a bounty hunter and chase down those who've murdered, thieved or -drumroll followed by silence- .....DIDN'T PAY THEIR FINES! Or you could become a miner moving from asteroid to asteroid trying to find profitable metals and minerals to process and sell. The choice is yours.   While the first trailer isn't gameplay, it could very well soon be that way. Developers have talked about two expansions they plan on releasing: 1. Being able to dock and get out of your ship to explore stations (I don't know exactly what they'd plan to do with that specifically) 2. Planetary landings and exploration. Frontier wants to put in wildlife, plant life, full blown cities filled with people and most importantly....buggies!   So in other words this game isn't done. In a way you could consider this a beta. And it does have minor bugs and crashes every once in a while so it makes sense. But it is a very polished, solid and fun beta. The negative people who just see this as 'pew pew you beat the game' can officially go screw themselves. Oh and I'll be very butthurt when you thumbs down my review for saying that. I will cry so hard. So please thumbs down my review for your griefer needs. Thank you.  Another thing to note is that this is not just a solo experience. The community is actually very friendly and it's very fun to enter a wing and do things together. So don't be shy, use that chat feature Frontier so cherishably put in so that you could complain about how no one talks or does anything together.  Do I recommend this game? Wholeheartedly, yes. And it'll only get a lot better in the future....wait this is the future....FRONTIER WHERE ARE MY DLC?! ....Oh near future. Got it. Great space simulator and a must buy for futuristic/space game lovers. Or a great start to those who are new and curious about them.  This is the guide section I mentioned at the beginning of my review. Don't be ashamed or feel stupid using it because the game does have a steep learning curve. Also note that this guide is for keyboard and mouse users (sorry HOTAS users nothing against you).  -In order to use the wing (party) system, simply hold shift and press W or alternatively press 2. In order to navigate tabs you use Q and E and space bar will select things. Select a commander and highlight the choices and choose 'Invite to wing'. If the person accepts you must go back into the friends tab and activate the nav lock on. In order for either of you to follow one anothers location in deep space you must have your wing beacon on. That is activated by pressing 4 or shift+D. Go to the functions tab, highlight beacon and select 'wing'. Note that every time you supercruise or go FTL it will go off so you have to re-activate it.  -In order to balance or shift power to systems, thrusters or weapons the default binds are the arrow keys. You'll know which one to press to shift power don't worry.  -While in supercruise and locked on to a destination it's best to start slowing down at around 10 seconds left. reduce throttle until your line hits the blue area and make sure it's at the bottom of that area as you'll just go right past your destination otherwise. Don't worry about having to adjust after that point. It will automatically control speed descent.  -When prompted, in order to assign scanners and/or weapons, press 4 and go to fire group. You have the option to make them primary (1) or secondary (2) fire. Press space in order to set it to primary, secondary or make it unusable. You also have the option to put weapons/scanners in another group entirely. Press D to shift over and you will be in your secondary loadout. You have the same option of setting to primary and secondary fire. In order to switch between the two sets the default button is N.  -In order to use a wake scanner, target (T) a wake in supercruise and follow your destination meters to slow down to the appropriate speed and you will automatically shift when in range. In order to hyper jump and follow someone you must deploy it in regular movement and hold down whichever you assigned the scanner to (primary or secondary). After the wake has been scanned, simply increase throttle and press J. Once prompted, align your ship with the destination vector and you will warp to the commanders location.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Captains Log, Will and Testament Star date 05042015  ' Pilots, I write to you from the Docking Bay of Aristotle City. I'm currently monitoring the space chatter and there's a rather irate CMDR out there who needs to dock and wants my butt out. Well he can jolly well wait. He's threatened to 'pop a laser cap' in my Sidewinder and I'm currently shaking in my space pants. I dont care. This is my fourth Sidewinder in as many days, It's tough out there in the great black if your current rating is Super Noob.  I'm trying to make money. Honestly. No contraband, no smuggling and no combat. I'm just a space guy looking to make his way on the right side of the law.  But it is tough.  There's limited contracts out there for an honest man. I tried a little commodity shifting in between bulletins, but er, unfortunately some idiot (ok, me) remapped the cargo jettison key right under the escape key so I lost about 690 Credits worth of computer components when exiting my Sidewinder menu's. I tried to scoop them up but I'm throttle happy and just kept whizzing by until they disintegrated.  I tried exploring, but flew a little too close to a Red Dwarf and fried my beans.  I succumbed and took on shall we say, a less than legal mission to transport some 'scrap' out into LTT387. Man, it was a long way out. But I persevered. Hopped to Docking points to refuel, planned my route carefully. I was going to make it.   I jumped into the sector and for once was not hurtling towards the planet at 'ohmygod' miles an hour and the clock was ticking. Two minutes to pay day. Two minutes to get some moolah and start outfitting my loaned ship. Heck, maybe even save for my own.  But no.   A space pirate named Agent Orange appears Wing Commander style and tells me 'now you die'. I made a dash for the escape vector but all I achieved was a centrifrugal spin right in his gun sights. I panicked. I jettisoned my cargo - again. Damn that mapping.   I died.   Again.  And now, here I sit in Dock, my fourth Ship, 'Noob Carrier IV' and just waiting for that big payday. Just itching to get out there in the vaccuum and make my way. I have 983 credits to my name and an insurance policy that buckling under my ridiculous claims. I dont know how to fly straight, can just about navigate and have bounced off the side for too many docking stations to be invited in again.   But by all the space Gods, I love this game...  Captain Noob, signing off'.",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"If you play elitie dangerous expecting it to have a predetermined story, guidelines to follow, or tutorials that hold your hand at all, then this game isn't for you.  However, if you're looking for a game that gives you the chance to pilot your personal starship across the galaxy, pirate, trade, bounty hunt, and mine asteroids at will, then this game might actuall suit you. Also, don't mistake my saying that this game has no predetermined story as meaning that it has no story.  In fact, it has thousands of stories progressing in real time. You find yourself mining in peace only to hear a news broadcast about a slave revolt in a nearby star cluster. If they succeed, the star system's economy would tank and the ore you're mining would become worthless, you think to yourself. Armed with motive, you swap out your mining laser for a multi-cannon at the nearest orbital station and head to the conflict zone, helping to quiet the revolt.   This game is a sandbox. The story, constantly changing and told through pieces of information you gather from every station across the galaxy, can be molded into whatever shape suits your needs and desires at the time.

Do I recommend it? If you want a space sim with virtually no bounds, where you start as a nobody, to carve out your own path, this IS your game. The 400 billion stars of our very own Milky Way, will become your playground.   Old timers, who've seen much steeper learning curves than this, won't have much trouble. New guys however, will need patience and the foreknowledge that in this game, there's no such thing as instant gratification. It's called Elite for a reason.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Initial impressions: Elite Dangerous has amazing graphics, sound, and controls for a space dogfighting game. It lacks direction for the player and is a complete sandbox that will probably keep many casual gamers away, but this is a great game if you are willing to put in some time to get started and figure it out.  The graphics and sound still blow me away.   Update: After 20 hours of gameplay I can start seeing the bigger picture. I've also shown this game to a few friends and we now have a group of seven people for our private group (you play on a private server with people in your group).  Exploration is very time consuming, but a lot a of fun. Its mostly predicting where planets/solar systems will be in a specific system and trying to find them with scanners. We're currently trying to find unexplored systems with good spots to bounty hunt/buy ships/trade.  Combat is what keeps me the playing the game for many hours at a time. Dog fighting is very satisfying and everything about it just feels right. Controlling the multiple systems while in a fast paced battle results in vastly different skill levels amongst different players. This doesn't mean you need skill to do combat. You simply adapt your skill to a style. The best players can play in fast ships with close range weapons while others can back you up with missles, take shields off with lasers, or even snipe with railguns.  None of us have engaged in trading as of yet. Likely to try it out once we can afford some nice trading ships. We do know that exploration ties heavily into trading. Finding two systems that have differing functions close to eachother results in easy money from trading as they will buy the other systems goods.  Knowledge is a great source of power and wealth in Elite Dangerous.  Our group started with goals. The first being to find a system to call home and work around. Followed by finding shipyards and stations with good ships and outfitting services which we are still working on.  Later goals are likely to be extensive exploration / checking out faction wars / picking minor factions to support in our turf. Haven't decided if we want to play in the open world format. We are actually just looking to get our private group big enough to enjoy all aspects of the game as this game is a ton of fun with friends.  Game has been a load of fun for us. If you like space simulation games you'll enjoy Elite Dangerous. Might want to wait for the price to drop if you are unsure, but I think many players will enjoy the game as long as they know what they are getting into.  There is no main story. There is no real direction of you need to go here and do this. You start in a station and can do whatever you want which many people will take hours just figuring out what that even means. If you create that direction for yourself this just might be the space sim you always wanted. If not you will likely quit from boredom within a couple days.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"I am CMDR Dnath and i approve of this game.  -Make sure you can be creative when playing(no hand holding). - Play for fun not just to grind. -Become immersed in a seamless universe. -Bring friends.  20hrs in, I can land, hyper jump, takeoff, run bounties, trade/ exchange and maneuver my ship(for the most part haha)- I say this lightly, but make sure you learn the mechanics before discarding as tooo hard. The time invested will pay out, I am learning more every flight.  40hrs- Still flying. Went for some combat, upgraded my Eagle and started bounty hunting.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"The game grows on you. At first I felt 'mile wide, inch deep.' You've seen one star system, you've seen them all, what's the point.  But still the game kept calling me back, and I realized the RP potential of the game is insane.  By RP I don't mean 'how art thou galadriel, shall we absconce and slay the evil wizard?'  I mean that the player's ability to really immerse themselves into being a grizzled freighter captain, or bounty hunter, or merchant, or miner, or whatever have you, is off the charts.  You can play this game in so many ways, it can play like Euro Trucker or Farming Simulator, you can operate a passenger cruise line, you can play it like a mogul hiring other ships and crew, or you can be the solo fighter pilot or explorer, landing on planets and seeing what's in that cave over there.  The amount of time this game can absorb is scary. I feel like it can easily take over a life.  Forget 'Star Citizen.' THIS is the real Star Citizen.  The committment and plans the devs have is amazing. See, this isn't like a game where they just made it and they're done. They have mutiple planned expansions, for opening up new aspects of the game, making it deeper, richer, more immersive. Just when you think you've mastered being a fighter pilot, it's like 'here, do the same thing on this moon. Here, try engineering. Here, hire a crew.' It just keeps expanding with more and more content, more things to do.  Eve was good, I have to say. Eve is real good. Star Citizen is ambitious but probably vaporware.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Played almost a hundred hours in a week, so i'd say it's ok ;)   Seriously though, i wasn't sure this game would draw me, as i was looking to pass the time till star citizen and no man's sky, but boy did this one hook me. Yes it is repetitive, yes you can't land on planets, yes there is no offline mode, but overshadowing all these is the sense that this game is actually alive and real. You are a nobody in the whole wide universe, but work with the community and you can change it little by little: Help terraform a planet and expand civilization by transporting the necessary materials - side with the rebels in a star system to overthrow the existing goverment (or the opposite, crush the resistance!) by taking part in the war - and who knows what the devs will come up with next..  Best part for me though is you can play vastly different roles, that actually matter (even if only a tiny bit) within the universe - and you can do this playing solo (no griefers and still all the community fun).  - Exploration: 400 billion stars to explore! The fun is in finding desirable rare things such as earthlike planets and black holes, then selling the cartographic data for profit and also putting your name on a planet as the first to discover it. Will you play it safe making short trips near on the edges of civilization ? Or will you go an a month-long journey to explore the edges of the galaxy ? What if you carry data worth millions and happen upon a skilled pirate ?  - Pirating: It's not always as simple as blowing up other players. Many pirates will let you go for a price. But pirates beware, for as soon as you commit any crime inside civilized star systems you should be very afraid when another ship beginns to 'scan' you. You'll be hunted down if you happen upon a security ship or even worse...:  - Bounty hunters: You'll be having fun hunting pirates, taking part in small- or large scale wars. Or why not team up ('wings') with a trader and see hiim safely through anarchy space ...for a price ?  - Traders: If you fancy yourself as a trader, prepare to be noting down prices alot (or use online crowdsourcing tools), searching the map for industrial and high-tech places or agricultural and terraforing places etc to trade between. Or maybe you'll make your mark as a trader of rare goods, which become more profitable the farther away you sell them.  - Miners: Tired of blowing up ships? Then blow up some rocks! You'll be searching for pristine metallic reserves in asteroid belts and rings, hunting down the pieces you laser off said asteroids and racing to a place in need of your metals and minerals. Beware though, pirates are aware of your favorite places.  All in all, if you're looking for an immersive experience look no further. Just be patient in the beginning while learning the controls and understanding how the universe and your ship's parts work. It is well worth it - and this coming from a player who really seldomly plays the same game more than a couple hours.",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"UPDATE: this game is addicting, i was thinking about it during sex :(   Some people complaining dont know what to do. I was in space for 4hrs straight not inching closer to my destination at all. ( i was 1.6 days away in real human life time, as in i needed to sit there for 1.6 days playing to reach my destination. However once i figured it out, i was there in 10 mins...Anyway if you can stick with it, put the effort into research aka play with google on your phone in hand. It slowly gets easier, and once its easy this is as amazing as it gets  . Theres one feature in this game i wasnt expecting...' conflict zones' you can go to..low and high intensity zones like going to another star or planet, When you get there you will see ALOT of NPCs battling it out all over the place in a star wars style battle. Oh yes, there will be players attracted to the fun. I cant tell you how many were at the low intensity one i was at, but im gonna guess maybe 9...and then...30 or 40 computer fighters...hell maybe more, i think if the NPCs die they respawn as another ship so the battle never stops. These zones come and go as wars end, new ones pop up. Its awsome because i was expecting player battles to almost be staged as in hey everyone meet here at this time for said epic battle...I am thoroughly pleased to know if i get bored of space exploring i can just literally turn to fighting in large scale engagements.. Its an amazing thing i saw traveling to my first real planet. And i grinned as ships exploded around me and lazers went off everywhere...JUST LIKE THE STORE PAGE VIDEO! the thing some people wanna say isnt in the game. They are wrong. These zones can be seen and are in world with all players, so you could be an explorer and look out your window to see a big battle as you pass it by. But this is a sim so, if you die you wont respawn in the thick of it like the AI will, youll respawn at the start. And youll have to  travel back to the battle.   UPDATE : I did transport missions until i was able to buy a better ship And if you chat through the in game comms with players its the coolest thing ive ever heard online, transmission static and noise but done right, its wicked cool.. JOYSTICK Recommended amazing immerison.  P.S. my buddy is black and the feds scanned his ship at a docking hub then told him to move along...ive never been scanned docking, i have 3 times the hours he does.   The missions are a way to make money, Youll find them on the bulletin board in starports. The world feels alive, I was attacked by a pirate AI ship, in mid supercruise and AI 3 police eagles came to aide me. They actually saved me. i have seen fleets. Im talking wings of 12 ships or more, cruising around together. 1 of them was a gang. I went to an asteriod belt, saw 20 something mining ships blasting asteriods with lasers then scooping up the smaller rock.Theres was also a War going on in 1 galaxy i went to. Big one lots of battles. The docs and ports are beautiful, full of life, and ships buzzing about in epic scale on some of the more popular ones. Im talking ships coming and going constantly, 98% real players. The stations have Extreme detail with little trucks drving about on them, blinking lights and many many docking bays. You will be issued clearence from them and given a specific dock to park at. At the docks you can order beer, wine, liquor, food, uogrades, weapons, ships, missions, the list goes on for a long time. The immersion is spot on. Its very real to me.   There can be alot of downtime in the game, as you travel well..space. whats neat is how theres routes that are well travels by other players and frigates and then theres just deep space, where you wont see much. The game always looks amazing,.. after watching interstellar earlier, and how beautiful the scenes were in that movie, this game is on par with it. Everything is jaw dropping pretty. You can invite players and buddies to be your wingmen, or even recruit up to 3 AI ships to follow you where ever.  I dont know any other space game that you can explore so far that you could literally be 24hrs from the nearest human in real time flight. thats is space my friends, you can feel crowded in a large battle, or feel more alone then playing doom... .   Anyway, i read the postive and negative reviews, got the game because I wanted to be an astronaut today, taking a chance. And at one point..3.5hrs in..i was lost, confused, bored, overwhlemed, shaking my head, running out of fuel and air thinking i bought the wrong game this is just too much.... and then..it all clicked, like a light bulb, and within 20 mins, i was engaging fighters in massive dog fights. some kinda federal navy ships attacking man i dont know. I promise this...if you stick it out, figure it out ( and it sucks to do) but once you get it...It may very well be considered one of the best space games out there. I personally...well lets see i bought it 6hrs ago i logged in 6hrs, its 7am, i dont want to go to bed or work, I dislike earth now. ..I. died twice, once intentionally, because i was confused and wanted to start over, and the other..i accidently slammed into a space station the size of texas at a high rate of speed in my 1 man fighter    For once, im glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews. You should still read them, they give some insight. But some of their chief complaints were 'space is too big, make the map smaller'  ...ugh..what?  ofcourse you dont see another player when you get WAY out there in deep space. isnt that the point of WAY out there. (can you imagine the excitement of running into someone if you ever did, 70hrs of gameplay away from the spawn. Talk about adrenaline) If you wanna see people some stay in middle space. Wanne see them everywhere stay in civliized space. Game could use solitare, mine sweeper, and angry birds on in dash computer to help pass time in deep space.   If your worried you wont grasp it...you will...you paid 60 bucks for it,...you wont stop til you get it, so you dont have that lost money sinking feeling in your heart anymore. Evntually that will turn into a sense of accomplishment and pride that you stuck it out. The graphics are out of this world, pun intended..and i truly feel that i have first hand experience now at crashing into a space station.  In closing YES this is a sim, I dont understand what else you do other then explore, meet people, form a group, maybe fight those massive battles in the conflict zones. (anywhere can be a conflict zone, just these are dedicated with a bunch of AI etc) Upgrade your ship with customizables and guns etc, trading, mining, piracy, blow stuff up, missions..transport this, protect this ship, attack this ship, go to this planet deliver this cargo. So i dont understand what else these guys expect in space? You can add your buddies and see their locations and meet up places. so your not left traversing for years calling out for each other asking players have you seen so and so? But your buddy must be in a galaxy or system, if they are in deep space, then you wont know where they are, If you like space, your really doing yourself an injustice not getting it. I think this game is worth 60 bucks and is the 3rd 60 dollar PC game ive ever bought. ( i like the 19.99-39.99) games ya catch my drift.) but i think in this game youll die in real life of old age before you ever see the whole map.   For the record i skipped the training, i heard it wasnt helpful. Its easier if you and a buddy share the learning curve, try to make a friend at the starting dock.or play with a steam friend. (unless you wanna be solo joe by all means do so, most do) Or as i said in the beginning, google. bing, yahoo, whatever, some kinda search engine and start learning to be an anstronaut from others mistakes and helpful videos and tutorials  UPDATE: bought a joystick today, mouse and keyboard in combat is more difficult then a t-rex tryna do pushups.",1,1

Almost year ago i bought R9 290 graphics card to be able to handle planets in this game. 6 months ago i bought 32inch display only for this game.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"First off, awesome game if you like awesome, I do recommend it.  - Use a Joystick - Go through the training - Watch the youtube tutorials   ^^^^ If you don't do the last two first, you will be doing it later. Though the game is not SUPER complex, without knowing a few of the basics you will get lost, and traveling at ludicrous speed and trying to figure out how you get out of supercruise is not a fun chore.  The game really shines everywhere in my opinion, it is beyond measure in size, it is BEAUTIFUL even on an Nvidia 660TI, the combat is fun, but what I love most...  The immersion.  How do they do it you ask? There is nothing you can't do from your cockpit, in fact, everything is done in the cockpit, as though you were sitting in the seat of your own spacecraft. Need to check what sun that is you are flying dang near into? Turn your head to the left. Need to get into your ships sub-systems and turn on some external lights so you can see the wreckage you found exploring? Turn your head right. The way the menus are done just floors me, I feel like I am really there.  Story time!  So, today, about 7 hours into my actual game play, I ended up getting a little to close to a sun. Got warm, ok not just warm, like hot and it started to fry my systems. I lost lifesupport, shield recharger and my FTL, crud, going to run out of oxygen in 4:30...how do I get to a station for repairs in 4 minutes without my FTL? Well...lets see what sort of systems we have in this thing...holy smokes a reboot and repair option under my sub-systems, lets give it a shot. *ship goes dark, sun is bright, ship systems rebooting*, whoa, what the heck. FTL has been repaired to 10%, I can divert all shield power and scanners to my FTL to get it to spool up and wammo! On our way to repair city!   ^^^ That right there was probably the best experiance I have had in a game since Master Chief met the Flood for the first time. I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings, I am headed out to a system a bit farther from the start, do some exploring, come back and sell my data, I think it will be a good day.  For those that stuck with it and maybe enjoyed what I wrote I hope it helps.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Elite: Space Trucker. I say this as a compliment, this game is unique as it's one of the few games to truly embrace what is required for a game to have serious longevity, massive amounts of boredom seperated by instances of knee jerkery.  What I just said probably won't interest most players though and that's the real shame here since this is an incredibly well done experience. The level of immersion in this game is borderline annoying but somehow that just makes everything better.  In this quasi mmo experience you are not a unique and special snowflake like in every other mmo experience, you aren't here to save the world, you are not the prophecy fufilled and no one cares about what you do. Just attempt to learn how to pilot your ship, try to make money and generally just get by...and that's pretty much everything you need to know about this game.  I recommend everyone buy this game not because I know every one of you will like it, I want you to buy it to give more money to the developers so they can continue expanding this amazing game, but if you don't like it and you feel you wasted your money then you should come back here and say 'This review was helpful' because clearly I warned you.  Seriously, I really did my best to warn you.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"When i first started playing, i thought i was never going to acclimate to the seemingly overly-complicated flight system.  All i wanted was a Freelancer-esque frolic through space.  I wanted to be a bounty hunter, or a pirate, or a trader, or an ace pilot or whatever my desires drew me to.  Then, after a few hours of dicking with the controls, i finally understood how this game worked. It all clicked.    And then i realised:  This game is a sandbox.   You can quite literally do whatever you want.  See a trader? Blow it up, steal his cargo.  See a wanted criminal? Kill him and collect your bounty. Notice that certain resources sell really high on a particular station? Go load up and haul them over.  Do missions for the Federation, or for the Empire, or for any one of hundreds of subfactions all vying for power.  There's so many factions by the way. Anything from trader groups to treasure hunters. You can join up with basically anyone and run missions with/for them.   You could even go passivist and just carry passengers from one end of the galaxy to another. There's an entire in-game market for that and it pays really well.   The universe is your oyster, you just have to figure out the tools to crack it open.  :)  TLDR:  Do anything you want as long as you get paid in space ",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"This game has so much potential. If you're expecting a big epic space adventure, you may or may not get it, depending on what your definition of epic is.   I find expecting it to be sorta a, space truck simulator, keeps my hopes undashed. It's fun to wing up with friends. Problem is you never really encounter as many people as you see in the trailers. They're few and far between.   How big this galaxy is, is really a blessing and curse. It's impressive but not always fun.  There's really not much to the Horizons expansion. You can land on planets! --But only planets that are entirely rock. There's a lot to be desired with the planetary exploration. As of now, it's just big rocks of different colors, sometimes with a dock or two, occupying a speck of an otherwise bleak and empty world. Apparently there's more to come later this year though.  IDK. I still enjoy the game. It's a major grind fest though. What action you find will almost always just be against NPCs. There's lots of time spent just kinda, driving. It's fun, impressive, big. but certainly has it's drawbacks. ",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"A spaceship simulator where human inhabited space is a bit like the wild west, and you're just out to make an living out of it. I'm coming to this game as someone who never played any of the previous Elite games, and I play this game with a cheap HOTAS joystick, and I don't personally wing up with other players online.   You start off in a very basic 'Jack of all trades' ship, you work your way up by doing missions, carrying cargo, couriering, exploring, combat, bounty hunting, mining, assassinations, smuggling, and finding buyers for your goods. Buy new ships, attain upgrades, and rank up with the various factions. No central 'story', but there is an evolving political environment that responds to player community actions.  Right now there are 29 ships in the main universe that you could pilot, each one handles differently, most of them can serve different roles better than others. Plenty of different loadout customisations for your ships, including many different weapon, utilities and internal compartments.   The good for this game includes the sheer size and scope of the universe: travel faster than the speed of light from Mercury to Saturn and watch as the surface detail of the rings slowly come into focus. A scientifically accurate modelling of the playable galaxy based on the real world Milky Way. Customisable and flexible ships to suit your playstyle. Exciting dogfighting combat. Easy to drop whatever task you're doing and do something else in game. Graphics can be stunning, sounds are amazing, runs fantastic with my GTX 680 (2560x1080 ultrawide, comfortably over 60FPS). I would also say that my experince has been positive when it comes to bugs, they are generally quite rare. Developers are always adding new content to both the base game (Elite: Dangerous) and the Horizons DLC.   The neutral for this game would be that the Close Quarter Combat game-within-a-game feature can be difficult to find other players (if you care about this mode), huge size of the game means it can be rare to find other players in game. If an true offline mode is required for you, you might want to give the game a miss, as the solo mode still requires internet access to update the in-game markets, community goals and exploration data.  The biggest negative for this game for me would be that without the Horizons DLC, the exploration aspect of this game would be extremely bare bones (you jump to locations, and point your ship at intesting planetary bodies to gain information about them, and sell this information).   At the time of writing this review, I wouldn't say that the DLC is required for enjoyment, but that may change before the end of the year, with the introduction of the ability to launch your own mini-fighter ships from larger ships.  tl;dr: it's Eurotruck Simulator, but in space and in a spaceship. And you can blow up the traffic instead if you want.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I ran out of fuel in a middle of far away uncolonised solar system. No stations for atleast another 40,000 light years. It was at this moment I knew I was screwed , i turned off my engines , life support and all none vitals. An eery silence set in , as I started gasping for breath. 4 mins left of oxygen..... dont panic I tell my self while looking into the black abyss. I light up a cig while looking at the self destruct button and contemplating letting go of all i fought for:80 tonnes of cargo , solar system after solar system of map data and most of all my precious ship. I bring up my Firefox , a quick google search , 'help im stuck in space and have no fuel'. First result  'fuelrats.com' . Holy ♥♥♥♥ , is this real!?!? I think to myself. Only one way to find out. I turn back on life support and continue to breathe again , and frantically input my commander name , and location. Within 20 minuites a beautiful sight was seen on the horizon. My saviour! Luck would have it the fuel rats came and transfered some fuel to me , enough to make it back to the nearest space station with my hefty cargo hold. If only they knew what was in there , I just hoped they wouldnt do a cargo scan...  This is why I love this game , it's a game where you create your own stories and live them out fully fleshed , anything can happen at anytime while online and the most immersive space sim anyone could own. There are many communities in the game such as the 'fuelrats' that go out of their way to make the very expansive world feel more full of life. It's the community in this game that really make it feel like a living breathing world.  10/10 Would not plan my space route again",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Absolutely amazing, Controls are meh, but f**king god, this game is beautiful and so fun to just explore, the map is huge and the gameplay is great. Only things that i see bad about it are the controls, you get lost easily and it just came to steam after a while of being out on its own website. Still love it",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I know a lot of people hate the 'grind' to this game but it only is a grind if you make it one. Elite Dangerous is a truly immersive game with plenty of opurtunitys in game i personally am a fan of bounty hunting myself but as long as you don't push yourself in and endless grind its a great game, only when you grind for end game content does the game lose its fun. but if you just go with the natural progression it goes by quite fast. Overall I give this game 8.5/10 stars",1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,"It's a shame that casuals are not recommending it because it is too complex.  When it comes to the game, I have never been entranced like this since I last played skyrim or Civilizaiton V, and I spent at least 100hrs in both. Nice UI, often a little confusing however and there is basically no instruction (which I like). There are no goals, apart from your own agenda, which I also like. The colour pallette is O.K. and I felt inspired by wonder quite a few times but apart from that the planets look relatively simaliar. The cockpit is astonishingly detailed and the Universe is astonishingly big.",1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Alright listen up,  I don't usually recommend games because I'm either too busy chopping wood or lifting heavy things, so you know that when one of these pops up here from me, the game either TERRRIFYINGLY good or AMAZINGLY bad.   Elite: Dangerous. With a name like that you can be sure that this game will start giving you heart palpitations the moment you slide your mouse over that 'add to cart' button. Two very strong, very HARD words. Makes my palms sweaty just thinking about it. MMMFFF. The game drops you into a tiny spaceship with a thousand bucks in your pocket and it is up to you, yeah YOU, to make the most of the huge playable world and endless amount of content. No missions, no storyline, no bullsh*t. This game ain't going to hold your hand JUST LIKE ME I AIN'T GONNA HOLD YOUR HAND WHAT ARE YOU SOME KINDA SISSY?!  Be a miner, a trader, a vigilante, bounty hunter, pirate scum, anything you want to be you can do it. Go where you want when you want and don't give two spits about WHO THE HELL IS TRYING TO ROB ME because there's always someone out there be it fellow space-game enthusiast like you, or a scheming little NPC who is looking to steal that one package of dehydrated milk you're trying to transport across the system.  Basically, 10/10 because some WEASEL tried to suck me out of my supercruise to steal my three packages of tea which I worked WAY TOO HARD TO FIND A STATION IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT SELLS TEA. ITS TEA PEOPLE. Irregadless, I escaped that snake, went back to his faction, told them thirteen tons of Animal meat and completely crashed their economy. I went on to find that slimy mole and sent him tumbling into a star before I got paid and spent it all on generic alcohol and cigars you can smoke... in space.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Edit: Powerplay info added.  Link for starters guide below.  Do not let the play time fool you. I have over a thousand hours in this game. Frontier unlocked Steam keys to Beta backers, and now I get to write a review about this game.   1. This game is amazing. Do not let any of the negative reviews complaining about the lack of content fool you. This game grows and adds more content about every 2-3 months. As proof the Powerplay update added a whole new way to play as a free patch. There is a whole political factions system to play with now. The development team is active and works with the community frequently.   2. There is no mistake this game is hard. Not like your normal hard but kick you in the pants hard, and when you fall over crying kick you in the face for good measure. You NEED to do the training. Do the docking training 4 or five times. If you still wanting more I made an instructional set about some of the things training does not cover.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"People say you don't have much to do in this game, they say is too complicated and that’s easy to get overwhelmed. I have been a fan of the space genere for years, played descent, combat flight simulator, wing commander, and a lot of other games.  If you are a space fan, like dogfighting , twitch control of your ship, this game is for you. It feels so satisfying that i cannot even begin to explain.  They also have a long list of features they want to add to the game, half of them sound surreal, on my side im very happy with the game as it is, but if they add more stuff or expansions i have to buy, all i have to say is shut up and take my money, please, take my money.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I am somewhat new to flight games so this is a new experience to me. I wanted to play Star Citizen, but my PC could not run it well. This game is very optimized and runs fine with my GTX 650 2GB. Saying I am a noob, there is a learning curve but DO NOT quit when you first start. Right now I am not very good, but with practice I will become better.  PROS: -Very optimized -fun gameplay -good if you don't like to be pointed in a direction  CONS: -learning curve(if you are new but with practice will get better) -probrably better if you have a joystick or something like that(keyboard and mice is fine though just preferance) -you have to do things yourself without much help(I do not mind since I like to do my own thing)  Final Verdict: I personally thing this game is very fun and also challenging. If you like to do your own thing and like space sims, this is for you! I plan on putting many more hours on this game right after this review is posted.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,If you have an xbox 360 controler set the option to advence gamepad  Then train on landind and navigation is the staring most needed skill  You can choose between single player or multi player. I would advise single player untill you get the hang of the controls.  This game has a complex controll system. that shows the depth of this game :) You can pick a name for youself then later choose male or female  Geting into the traing station requires you to spin the ship while going through air lock. dont forget to call the station for clearance. and basic stations needs you to fly around looking for landing point. center on landing point then face forward on landing pad with gear down. to Dock with station.  TRY not to get greedy on your first mission. My first mission requred 3 system jumps to complete.,1,1

Well Worth it, So Much Awesome",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Elite is a special kind of game. It is one of those games you just have to like to have fund with. It is similar to Flight Simulators or even ArmA. You either like it or you do not. If you like it, you will have the time of your life and it will be easy to look over all of it's problems without regert but if you dislike it, well... then it feels like the biggest piece of garbage you can buy for money.   -If you enjoy games with atmosphere, that put you in a gigantic world where you are on your own without any big instructions on what to do, Elite is your kind of game. -Do you like amazing graphics and awesome scenery to make screenshots off, possibly seeing things noone has ever seen before? Then Elite is for you. -You enjoy having to chose from a large variety of things to do in a game with none of them being mandatory at all? Then Elite is something you will like. -Do you enjoy cooperative RPGs where you can Team up to gain an advantage? Then you will have fun with this game.  Elite offers an entire, realistic galaxy with many things to do. Become a miner, a trader, a pirate, a soldier, an explorer, a Bounty Hunter, a rescue operator, a mercenary, a faction leader. All that is possible in Elite, even weird fuses between those jobs.  The galaxy simulation features real time trading between systems that is influenced by both NPCs and Players alike. If you sell a large amount of Mineral A to System X, then the demand for that Mineral will go down and the price will drop as they do not need as much of that Mineral anymore. Smuggle a load of Slaves into a station and watch it have an ecnomic boom. Kill system authorithy vessels and watch as the whole system slowly shifts who is in charge or even goes into complete anarchy.   The Power Play Factions are having an entire war in our Milky way. The so called 'Bubble' is the main playground for those, a cluster of systems around the Earth, where everything began. You can pledgy allegiance to one of those Factions and perform missions for them. Gather intel about other systems to allow your Faction to expand into it at some point. Activly help the Navy of your Factions in Combat Zones when attacking or defending a system. Do that in order to keep the influence in that system up or tear the influence of another system down. Gain merits by doing so, leveling you up in the ranks of your faction to allow bigger weekly payouts.  Don't enjoy any of the things named above? Elite also allows for many other things to do. For instance, you can just build an exploration ship and go explore the entire milky way. Yes I said the entire milky way. Think somewhat like 4.000.000.000 Systems. There is also quite some money to be made when finding special bodies or even finding things noone has found before.  Upgrade your ships internal parts: Shields, Hull, Sensors, Thrusters, Frameshiftdrive, Power Distributor, Power Plant, Weapons, Gadgets, Cargo, Reinforcement, Scanners, you name it. If that is not even enough for you, the Season Pass even allows you to farm for special Upgrades able to be applied on certain parts of your ship.    ====Negative things about Elite==== While it is a very beautiful and special game in my opinion, Elite currently has a lot of problems.  Getting into the game without help is very hard. You need at least some sort of information source like reddit if you do not want to spent hours and hours figuring out how things work. This is a very unique expierence but most people will not like finding out everything on their own.  The AI can sometimes be completely random and just attack you on sight without hesitation, causing a lot of frustration.   Some Materials, especially for The Engineers DLC under the Season Pass can be annoyingly hard to obtain and the outcome of the recipes are completely randomized so even a few douzen hours of farming can still leave you with something worse than the stock version.  Grinding in general is something any progress oriented player will dislike. It takes a long time to get those 155 Million Credits for that one ship you wanted and even if you are doing something that gets a good amount of money, you'll have to redo it over and over again. Not much change found there.  Playing without a proper input like at least a controller if not a Joystick or even something more professional leaves out a lot of the fun. This game just plays better with good equipment. It even has VR support to make it even better.    Overall I would recommand this game to anyone that likes Space Simulators or that is a fan of flight sims. Elite is a unique Space Flight Sim RPG Hybrid but a lot of fun if you manage to get into it.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Start out Supier cool looking stars are beautiful, ship looks like its a damn ship with blind spots. See new other ships, I want new shinies, start to grind it out with exploration spend 7 hours flying about getting data start to feel sleepy see last star in sector, and then off to sell my data to the station in sector Get interdicted because tired freak out and manage to jump away, right into the sun i just scaned, heat sink save me!!! doesnt work too much heat ship explodes entire day wasted, but I dont really care Would still spend entire day just to have a sun kill me  10/10",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"if your a fan of eve, but wished that you were actually flying; This is the game for you. If your a fan of the space sim, X series, but wished it was multiplayer; this is the game for you. If your waiting on Star Citizen, but have an extra $60, I would high~ly recommend adding this this beautiful piece of art to your collection.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"A slow paced game, its true. But after 4 hours of space trucking, when you hear the 'WHOOM' of an interdiction tether and glance at the sensors to see a little red dot of an enemy player on your tail... 448 tons of gold in the hold and a 10 million credit rebuy cost means if you die you will lose all the progress that 4 hours of trucking got you. Better hope you fronted the money for some decent shields and thrusters, you're gonna need all your tricks to get out of this one. Pop chaff, drop mines, deploy the turrets, and haul ♥♥♥. Get a scan of the enemy ship if you can so you know how to play this one. The chase is on- and you're going to need all the help you can get. It might only going to be a matter of seconds before you hear the dreaded 'shields offline- taking damage'  ^this feeling is what keeps coming me back, but the game has more to offer. The galaxy map is beautiful on its own, and exploring it is an almost spiritual experience. Watching stars and planets soar by, investigating the valleys and mountains of a planet that you are likely the first to land on, and finding rare stellar bodies like black holes and pulsars, all these thrills really don't wear off. The effort needed to find things like this makes them all the more rewarding, especially if you are the first to find an interesting system.  The atmosphere of this game is EXCELLENT thanks to the beautiful sound and graphic design. This game makes me FEEL like I'm in space. The hours of enjoying the vast stillness of space, is then shattered by a few seconds of pure adrenaline.",1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Period I will start with one thing... This game could be considered boring to many people who arent interested in its game style and lack of leveling and any type of ending.I personally arent that into the dog fighting aspect as fights can sometimes take quite a long time, I will at least get into it oncel I obtain a better ship and systems, however I am loving the exploring. Planning out a route through the stars, finding new planets, naming nebulae you happen to find first, checking out different planets and reading all the different makeups of star systems and sometimes finding gems where a system could have 4-7 super massive stars!!! The entire Galaxy is ours to explore. If you like developing good relations with certain government factions throughout the galaxy then there is plenty of trading opportunities and jobs available to take from simple trade missions to outstanding bounties on known criminals in nearby systems.... If you want to make a name for yourself in the Galaxy, here is ur chance!!! As a scifi nerd, gamer and science buff.. This game was made for someone like me who just wants to explore the galaxy and see all its wonders!!! Currently I an flying a Eagle class ship making my way towards the inner galactic center where I hope to find the galactic black hole as I wish to watch as stars wizz by and the black hole eats everything that comes near!!!!!",1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,"Ok, right from the start - this is a review for a special kind of player.  Many negative reviews are absolutly right about the lack of content and variety in the game. I would go so far to say, that this is a late beta which should have not been released for 60 bucks.  BUT....  If you someone fond of astronomics, space travel, star trek or sci fi in general, even if you are not a gamer at all...GET THIS GAME!!! Just the fact that you can explore our entire milky way at todays knowledge with realistic graphics and scale gets you alone.  Let me tell you about my first 30 hours in the game...  Got into it...let not fool you...its not overly complicated its just needs some work with the controls (recommend at least a gamepad and the tutorials)...and wanted nothing else than to explore. Since then I have not shot a single ship, delivered exactly zero cargo and made no errand boy missions. And despite of that reluctance of me to take part in this affairs I made a good coin just with the exploring data. My only long term goal is to get the Asp-explorer (the best ship for exploring for a reasonable price) and say good bye to human-'civilized' space.....  If you buy into that, you will be lost too!",1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,"I am no veteran in the Elite series, neither am I an expert at simulators or survivor games (bar Stranded Deep) so my review is honest.  It is very in depth and well thought out. You can trade, become a pirate or a bounty hunter, choice is yours, and you can switch between the paths quite easily. You build rep with factions with the list of factions being endless.   The world they have created is huge, I mean HUGE! My advice: I highly recommend this game, get straight into it but I must warn you that it doesn't offer much of a tutorial, its just you, your ship and endless, vast nothingness that is space and whatever it may contain.  All in all, if you're looking for an easy, enjoyable, worth-your-money space sim, look no further!",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Like Counterstrike and Battlefield had a child that was raised by Payday and put on steroids by insurgency...  Pros:  Very well rounded game. Runs very smoothly/very well optimised. Rounds are short and snappy. No two matches are ever the same. Extremely tactical. Excellent destruction 'Realistic'. Intuitive controls. Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played. HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard...if you are not prepared to play properly and just run around, you will die constantly and you will not enjoy it.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"EDIT: The 'Starter Edition' mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between 'starter players' and 'regular players' besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.   To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are 'free' and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.   Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this 'grinding' to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like 'grinding' to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an 'on sale' at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The 'grinding' is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator 'on sale' in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the 'full price for only multiplayer' argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a 'campaign'; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 'situations', each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a 'lone wolf' instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The 'time to die' is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to 'deal with' Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege," Rainbow Six Siege  is one if not the best FPS game I ever played... Let me try to describe it for you.  Rainbow Six Siege is a Tactical Shooter which its focus is completly in the multiplayer and competitive, with just some 'tutorials' that are done alone and can give you some Renown, these are called Situations and there are 11 Situations, 10 are Alone against Bots and the last one called Article 5 is cooperative against bots, like a normal 'Terrorist Hunt - Bomb' but with some story being it.  So, the multiplayer where this game shines is composed for 2 groups of operators, one being Attackers and the other Defenders, every round you switch between them with your teammates. Rainbow Six Siege has 3 gamemodes avaliable right now, which are:   BOMB:",1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good.  Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides 'scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too' and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think 'it's gg'. 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Rainbow Six Siege it's a great game, and I have had a lot of fun playing it.   However I would recommend if you are thinking about buying it, to have friends to play with as the game itself, is far more enjoyable when you play with people you know and can easily chat to while playing.  It is a game focused on giving as much information to your team-mates as possible and I find the communication can be lacking when playing with randoms.  Pros:  + Many different operators with unique abilities to choose from. + BattlEye Anti-Cheat + R6S is a HIGHLY TACTICAL game. + Wonderful graphics. + DLC doesn't limit anyone, You can play DLC maps for free and unlock DLC operators with in game renown. + Most skins only cost in game currency.  Cons:  - UPLAY, UBISOFT. We got Steam already. Your existence is pointless!! - Ping is a big ***** issue!!!! - RANKED matches are not balanced. - 5 rounds per game is too short. - No single-player mode.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"The deepest tactical shooter I've played in my life. Every decision made has put gameplay over realism and tradition in shooters, and they've got a masterpiece to show for it. It's as simple and elegant as chess with the same learning curve as you discover new combinations, strategies, and counter-strategies.  If you like hardcore shooters, do not miss this game, and do not pass judgment lightly. If you're looking for the Unreal Tournament or Call of Duty experience, this is not for you.   Edit: In response to 0.1 hours on record comment. I played alpha, both closed betas and their preceding technical tests, got a few rounds in during Siege Day in LA, and spent a week at Ubisoft Montreal playing the game and giving feedback on behalf of the community. To verify this, you're welcome to watch the 'Road to Montreal' livestream footage on YouTube; I'm 'geofurb' in those matches. I'm probably one of the most experienced players at the moment, though that's sure to change shortly!   Edit 2:  If you launched the game once, but on second launch Uplay prompted you to install:  1. Quit Steam. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common and rename the folder 'Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege' to 'Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege bak'.  2. Launch Steam. In your library, right-click on Siege and click 'Delete Local Content'  3. Change the name of the folder back to the original name, 'Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege'. When you press 'Install' in your library, it will find the existing installation instead of downloading the files all over again. You can now launch the game. This is a permanent fix, and you will not have to repeat these steps every time. Enjoy!",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Rainbow Six is back with a new title and it's only multiplayer, but will you want to play it ?  Rainbow Six Siege the new game in the Rainbow Six series. This game rose up from the ashes of what once was Rainbow Six Patriots.   The game is set in current times where the fight against terrorism is full blown out. Terrorist are conducting massive attacks around the world and you play as either the terrorists or the rainbow unit which consists of worldwide response units.   As stated before the game has no story whatsoever. The only thing you can do solo is a situation mode which teaches you the basics of the game and the incredibly fun Terrorist Hunt mode. The game has one story mission which is online only which tasks you to go to a US college and defuse a toxic bomb, the mission is notable because it obscures your vision with toxic gas and you need to work as a team to defuse the bombs, cause the mission is really difficult.  The AI for solo mode is not stupid so you won't be able to Rambo the entire map. You will have to be smart with your actions since the AI is pretty smart. They change up they're routes and will try to flank you and rush you any chance they get, they're aim is pretty good as well.   Now for the reason you might want to buy the game, THE PVP.   Trust me when I say this, the game is no joke. This game is incredibly difficult and doesn't hold your hand. You will need to work as a team if you want to win. A well placed shot will take you out and a well planned attack might earn you a sweet victory.  The game suits many play styles, from a support who helps out teammates in the field, to a pyromaniac who likes to blow up everything in sight. You will definitely find an operator that suits you the best.  Even though there's not many maps, each map is very dynamic. It's big enough for you to defend, but no matter what remember, you are never safe. You can destroy almost every wall, ceiling or floor so you never feel safe no matter how good your defenses are.   The game has one major flaw and that's the horrible servers. The servers are way too unpredictable. At one moment they work fine, the other they won't give you any money or won't even load you to the game. Ubisoft stated that they are working on fixing this issue so I trust them to get it sorted out.  The game is optimised incredibly well. It runs at 60 fps maxed out. If you have a high end PC you will have no trouble running this game.  In the end do I recommend the game ? Yes I do. I do suggest at the very least waiting for the server issue to be fixed and you have one of the best squad based games ever made. Get a few friends for the ride and you have one incredible game on your hands.  Final Rating: 9/10 - A must own (after servers are fixed)  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Straying from previous titles in the acclaimed Rainbow Six saga, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege sees the debut of storyless multiplayer missions in which players are tasked with a range of objectives, from obtaining a vulnerable hostage, to deactivating a volatile bomb. It is this wide variety of game modes that allows players to experience a unique battle every match.  Multiplayer is the key word for this game, because you will gain nothing from Siege if you are looking for a single player experience. Terrorist Hunt features an offline Lone Wolf mode and the game’s “Situations” comprise of ten single player missions, but that is literally all there is. Situations are polished tutorials where the game will demonstrate certain mechanics, with you needing to complete an objective against AI opponents. Judging these missions as tutorials, they are actually very strong. Each one teaches something new, lets you experiment with multiple operators, and rather than forcing the player to press their way through explicit instructions, it plays an intro cinematic, and leaves you to your own devices.   Levels in these situations are adjusted to not have as many options available to the player as in the full multiplayer game, but at no point does it stop you or take control away from you in order to make its point. The designers understand that mechanics are much easier to memorize through direct use instead of making the player read text, which is a good thing, because there are a lot of things to memorize.  Siege, at the time of this review, features 13 multiplayer maps and 26 unique operators. Each of these operators has a special quality that makes them ideal for certain scenarios, but this is when the game begins to reveal its depth. For example, Kapkan is a Russian Defender, his ability is to place laser tripwire explosives on windows and doors. For balancing purposes, they are very visible to the enemy, as long as they are paying attention to each entrance. This means that if you want to eliminate enemies with these charges, you’ve got to try and get in their heads. Instead of hiding the lasers behind barricaded doors, you can leave them visible, encouraging the enemy to proceed down another path that you will lay in wait for. You can place wires that slow them down in one path, and your explosive trap down another that appears to be quicker for the enemy.   This mental game is something that seeps its way into every round of Siege regardless of the operator or map, from the planning phase to the final ten seconds. Its 5v5 structure is key to this. Because each team has so few players, and no respawns, it immediately puts the pressure on every operator to perform well. Every death in this game is significant, death means less vantage points, less fire power, less Intel, and one less ability that could end up being very crucial to your success. Anything can happen at any second, no matter the circumstances. A team that’s down by three points in Ranked Matches can still comeback, a single player can kill five opponents, a defensive plan that you meticulously crafted can be utterly destroyed in seconds.  That tension is something I’ve missed from modern shooters. After Planetside 2 was released and publicly humiliated any shooter bragging about playercounts, I hoped that it would encourage developers to go back to experimenting with smaller, tighter, more focused designs. That’s been happening in the Indie genre with games out of necessity, but Rainbow Six: Siege is the first Triple A game I’ve experienced to take this approach.  Probably the biggest example of something that Siege does that an Indie studio simply does not have the budget for, is the destructibility. Battlefield is the franchise that popularized this mechanic in shooters, but since Bad Company 2, and failing to impress people with Battlefield 3’s micro-destruction effects, we’ve seen it be used more for spectacle than an actual mechanic.   Siege takes that consistent and fine-tuned destruction from Bad Company 2, while successfully combining it with micro-destruction on small maps. Every weapon can damage destructible walls and floors, and the game is very consistent about what you can and can’t destroy, which allows players to properly use the destruction as a strategic tool.   Defenders can reinforce walls to force the enemy down a path, but the attacker Thermite is capable of breaching these, not allowing the defenders to forget about them. It’s this depth and strategy that mitigates the relatively small number of maps. There’s also no level in this game that I would classify as “bad”, which is very rare in a multiplayer focused title, it’s expected for them to have a couple duds.  Thankfully, all of the important post-release content is being released for free, without the need for a season pass and not dividing up the community, a trend that I’m glad to see is spreading. I’m certain that this lack of paid DLC maps is what has led Ubisoft to implementing micro-transactions for certain skins, and boosters. Thankfully, the micro-transactions are not required to enjoy the game.  Optimization is much better than previous Ubisoft games, but that’s really not something to be proud of. Considering the size of the maps, and the small number of players and NPC’s in Terrorist Hunt populating them, the game really should run smoother than it does on lower end machines. For higher end PC’s, there are lot of options for people to adjust, which is refreshing.  Then there’s the netcode, it sucks. The poor hit-registration is probably the greatest flaw. It’s not rare to be killed behind solid cover, headshots to go undetected, and to watch your enemy paint the walls with their lost blood, only to see they still have full health. I’m not sure who or what is to blame for this problem, but in a game where intense situations are frequent, it’s infuriating to feel like you lost when you know for a fact that you shouldn’t have. I think what it makes these flaws even more frustrating is that for the most part, the game avoids that. Nearly every lost round in Siege is deserved, and in turn, so is every victory.  It’s this quality that makes the game so addicting, and will keep you playing round after round, long after you should’ve gone to sleep. I’ve had matches in this game that left me with shaking hands and a pumping heart, every 1v1 dual ends with both players exhaling their long held breath.  Be warned that while I am an avid supporter of this game, I’m aware it’s not for everyone. Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege is a stressful and downright punishing game, it takes no prisoners, one little mistake or overlook on your part can be the cause of your team’s demise. That kind of experience is not something every gamer desires. But if you’re like me, and you’ve been waiting for squad-based shooter that pushes you and your friends to the edge, demanding your full attention, and rewarding you with victory that is truly earned; grab your buddies and get ready to plan, fortify, and execute!",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Never had my heart beat so fast while playing video games than this. 8/10  Edit*   Since my review came op as one of the most helpful i've decided to expand it with some details  Rainbow six siege is mainly about two teams fighting agaisnt each other in a FPS counter terrorism world, one team as the defenders (Terrorists) other team as attackers (Counter-terrorits). The special thing about this game is the strategi and the destruction of the maps.  every game can feel very different, because both teams has a fair amount of characters to choose from who all has one special abililty. The destruction is a very big factor why i think the game is great, it gives it a LOT of replayability. There are so many different ways to defend a point or even to attack one. the teamplay and strategi is also important, your team will have a WAY higher chance of winning if you all communicate and plan your attacks.  The singleplayer isnt as great as the other rainbow games, there are basically two ways of playing singleplayer, one is to play lonewolf in terrorist hunt, terrorist hunt is your team or your self agaisnt AI. The other way is to play situations which are premade lonewolf maps with AI. there is no campaign.  The design of the game is really MLG as i would call it, all the characters doesnt really look like counter-terrorist units. which isnt a bad thing it just kinda takes the imersion away. otherwise the map is just trying to simulate the real world, which it does nicely. The graphics runs well on my computer with the highest settings.  The gun play and gameplay is close to perfect (If you ask me). its nothing like arma 3 but it has a very good feel to it, and sometimes even so much that i feel like i'm a SWAT solider breaching into a building ;D. There are sometimes where its kinda unrealistic but its nothing close to a problem.  The commuinity i have played with is nice, they play toghter, work togther and most importantly they communicate (Have had some games with people that didnt work togther at all but it doesnt ruin it)  (Nothing about the game it self) I just want to add that ubisoft have made a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff like AAC Unity, i'm very happy how this turned out since it was one of my childhood games. but that doesnt mean that ubisoft are the 'good guys' they still use Uplay, and many of their games are overpriced (if you ask me). Thats mainly why i would say YOU SHOULDNT buy the game. BUT the game is still a ton of fun, and if you want it i truely recommend it.  Now go read the top rated review insted of mine.",1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"A tactical shooter centered around either attacking or defending a structure may not sound unique or new, but Rainbow Six: Siege really takes that idea and expands on it in amazing ways.   RS:S is a continuation of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six saga and the story is much of the same you'd expect in a game like this, but it does the job: an international terror group is attempting to cause as much destruction as possible for reasons unknown and you're part of an elite counter-terror team tasked with stopping them. You can get your bearings with the tutorials and after that, there are a number of singleplayer missions that expand on the game's features. Both the tutorials and singleplayer missions are invaluable to learning the game and the various maps that you'll encounter in multiplayer. You can jump into multiplayer at anytime, but it's not advised to do that right off the bat.  The loadout available to you in multiplayer is based off of the Operator you choose to play as - unique characters unlocked with Renown, a form of game currency that you earn by completing the tutorials, singleplayer missions, or multiplayer matches and specific objectives and actions between the three of them. There is a microtransaction alternative to Renown points, but worry not: you earn more than enough Renown points through regular gameplay. Each individual Operator also has a special piece of equipment unique to them and there's enough variety to make them all useful in their own ways. You can also play as the generic Recruit character with access to default equipment.  As mentioned before, RS:S is centered around defending or attacking a structure with the aim to disarm bombs, rescue hostages, or simply kill the opposing team. However, what makes RS:S special is the means and methods the game provides to you in order to carry out these objectives. Nearly everything in the game's environment can be destroyed or damaged in some way, creating endless tactical scenarios: you can destroy the ceiling to swoop in on an enemy team, trade fire between destructable walls, breach doorways and destroy barricades obstructing your path, deploy ground-based drones to suss out enemy positions - the possibilities are endless. On the flip side, the defending team can set up a plethora of traps, barricades, and other obstructions to impede the other side, all the while having access to various surveillance methods to keep a close eye on the going-ons of their base. The unique Operator characters on either team make use of EMP grenades, sticky gas bombs, deployable manned turrets, heartbeat detectors and much more. But remember, slow and methodical is   not   how you want to play this game - reminiscent of real life breaching tactics, you're expected to be fast and decisive!  The environment is the true star of RS:S. It can mean either life or death depending on how a team decides to use it and can be shaped to each individual players' whims, and that is what makes RS:S special.   Absolutely recommended.",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"This is a long review from someone who has played the game since release, reached high ranks in ranked mode (Gold II), and seen some ♥♥♥♥ turn to diamonds. I'm reviewing Siege in terms of its current state, July 2016. Also, I'm too lazy to proof read so excuse any typos/grammar errors.   Summary: Siege is an online-only game. I've played this game since it's release, and I can definitely say I recommend this game... to a certain audience. Simply, this is a tactical shooter, where patience truly is a virtue. I can see how some players may find this frustrating compared to other popular fast-paced shooters, but in my perspective I feel they are completely different genres using the same elements of game play. For instance, you'll find yourself crouching 80% of the time to avoid detection and remain out of sight of the apposing team. In my experience, this is the best tactic to use when starting out, which again, may be frustrating for some. Now, for the issues which I personally have come across and still exist. Note that there have been bug and minor gameplay fixes (i.e. increased Mute's Jammer range, people hiding in certain spots of the map which cannot be accessed on the other end).   Issues:  Hackers - The obvious issues which I've come across while playing, of course, are the hackers. The new anti-cheat system has potential and I encourage Ubisoft to keep improving FairFight. In some cases, hackers are still getting away even when five players report 'suspicious behavior', there have been times where the other team was co-operative enough to boot the player who's using hacks. In ranked, it's much less likely to happen because the team you start with is the team you end with. Despite popular opinion, I've found most of the player base non-toxic compared to its first release. What I've noticed, however, are that majority of hackers are around the Gold and beyond ranks of Siege, meaning casual and early points of ranked are relatively hacker-free.  FPS drops on Yacht (one map) - Maybe this is just me, but for some reason (I'm guessing due to the snowy environment) my FPS drops from 60 to 25-30 in this map. (AMD Radeon 380 4GB VRAM, 8GB RAM, 6-core AMD Processor for the curious). This seems to only happen on Yacht, but I've read that some have similar issues on other maps. Otherwise, I'm running Siege on (almost) highest settings available.   Pricing - I bought the game full price on it's release and haven't regretted it. However, I can see how intimidating it is for the general consumer, being $70 CAD for basically two game modes, split into random objectives on both (Bomb, Secure, and Hostage). This, I believe, is the biggest issue since I've come across the same players in the game over a span of days, weeks, and to my surprise, months (which I'm fine with, but going somewhere with this). The price pretty much lowers population of the Siege community and I fear once the game gets a price drop, Siege will become irrelevant, thus, a dying community. The starter edition (which is gone now, I think) did help boost player base, but...  In-game currency/THE GRIND - The starter edition is a massive grind. let me explain. I'm totally fine with the system Siege has for unlocking weapon skins, headgear, and other aesthetics, but I bought the regular edition, meaning I don't get access to new and upcoming operators for free on their release, where instead I must collect in game currency (reknown) to unlock them - which is arguably fair. Regular operators (in other words, classes) are easy and fast to buy. New ops cost much, much more unless you buy them with real money to skip ahead/season pass/gold edition/etc. 2k vs 25k. each match typically rewards 200-450 depending how well you did. To put this into perspective, I've only bought two of the four new operators in my 160 hrs of playtime. Although, I'll be fair to say I spent ~20k on aesthetics. but still. 160 hrs and I havent unlocked all Operators.   The Good:  Graphics &amp; Sound - Beautiful and stunning. It's such a great success that the game gets little more challenging when I'm playing in a daytime vs nighttime map because it becomes hard to focus your sights indoor vs outdoor. Other than Yacht, I've had smooth performance in the game in (almost) max settings. The game emphasizes on sound, which really got me hooked on the game. 9/10  Gameplay - Very well done and is slowly improving as updates come. Maps are as destructible as possible, meaning you can blast through walls, barricades, windows, floors, whathaveyou - pretty much, anything made of wood. No mini map, no kill streak garbage, and the only info on your HUD are bullet count, available items to use, and compass. Bugs have been fixed (however, some do linger) and some operators obtained improved gadgets/traits. For PvP, given you're playing people with a similar skill set, it's very fun and intense. You're more likely to win by communicating than staying silent (i.e. rather than complaining about your death, you instead notify your team of the position of the opposing players and what you think they're planning) Even in death you can be useful by navigating cams. PvE (Terrorist Hunt) is also fun, but I use that game mode to blow off steam. In some cases, can be challenging, but again, patience is a virtue. Don't run around. I use some nice, high quality headphones which help gameplay drastically (You can sometimes hear enemies at the other side of a wall where you can shoot through). If you have a co-operative team, all the better. Guns are great, however there are a small amount of OP guns which need nerfing... particularly guns new operators use. 9/10  Community - Despite popular opinion and NOT taking in hackers in consideration, I like the Siege community. Yes, during it's first months, there had been much unnecessary ♥♥♥♥ talking and team killing. Don't get me wrong though, I'm fine with people boasting about their wins, however, people look stupid after ♥♥♥♥ talking while playing on casual. save it for ranked bud. Anyways, when I play casual I try my best to give new players tips and ideas, which mostly have respected and taken in consideration, but I don't let the bad apples spoil the bunch. The sense of community is a big deal to me in Siege because of it's co-operative aspect. Listen to teammates, follow them if you aren't sure what to do (which I always remind people), don't yell on your mic cause you ran in my line of fire, therefore don't be a ♥♥♥♥. Lastly, sometimes I've come across teams which just don't want to communicate at all, but that's just casual. Casual vs ranked really does feel like a different type of community. 7/10  Overall - I like that Ubisoft hasn't forgotten about this game and are at least doing somethings to improve it. Even since release, I've been able to avoid/ignore issues which were first introduced in the game and still am because they're manageable. It's super fun, rewarding, challenging, realistic-ish, and my favorite tactical shooter. I recommend this game, but not at it's full price given the content and how likely you are to stick with the game. Be aware, though, that for a good experience you're hardware may need to be of some quality, but this seems to be the standard for AAA games nowadays. I give this game a confident 9/10 at a sale price.",1,1

My C4 was down there. I went through the first floor, came up on the other side, blew up my C4, and slowly crouched walked into the room he was hiding in guarding the hall way.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"I came from CSGO, looking for something to fill the gap in the games that I play, this game is similar to CSGO in the sense that its Bomb, Hostage and so on, but this game is so much more than CS, the mechanics are awesome, I love the fact danger comes from every angle. Through walls, ceilings, floors, it keeps you on your toes, more skill is involved, It takes a little while to learn but if you have game sense you'll do ok.  But the best part about it, no $1000 skins, no gambling, its not just there to make money for a greedy company that cares only for the money it makes on skins rather than the game itself.  When this game is broken it gets FIXED, Ubisoft don't release sound updates when major flaws exist in the game, they ♥♥♥♥ing fix them. Take Blackbeard for example, one of the new operators, he has a shield, it was OP, they fixed it.  However, this game as a downside or maybe two, the community is as it always is in competitive games, toxic, but you learn to live with it.  But what does really ♥♥♥♥ing bug me....the DRM, Uplay its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, you have to exit the game and Uplay to get friend requests to show on your profile, and the lobbies often fail...I'm sure they're working on that, or atleast I hope they are....  This game is a massive plus in my collection, I didn't like it at first because I was so blinded by CSGO, but now I've left CSGO and started playing this, I don't think I'll go back.",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"This game is like anal , hard in the beginning  but you get a lot of pleasure once you get used to it.   ---------------------------------------------------------- It's tough, skill-focused, smart and notable game.   if you're a fan of stories and set-pieces rather than co-op and competitive online play, this really isn't the Rainbow Six you're looking for.  Like CS, R6S is all about deadly skills, snap reactions, strong map strategy and adaptability, and when one mistake can leave you dead and out of the round, you really has better pay attention and think before you move.  Its sad that the campaign isn't that long , but its teaches you the basics and  each of them has their difficulties so you will need your sweet time and effort.  Besides the campaign you got casual , competive and terrorist hunt  Casual is just a 5vs5 casual match , competive a 5 vs 5 competive match. The matchmaking isn't perfect , e.g : sitting in a team like this : lv20 , lv 69, lv89 , 100+  And terrorist hunt is where you play with a 5 man team to play against bots , its sounds easy but without real teamwork and strategy you are dead. Ripperino   The grafics aren't bad , but here all the love and work has gone into the game's destructible detail, as gunfire and explosions tear great chunks out of stud walls and furniture, and as breach charges shatter tough stone walls ectr  I don't think there are a lot of games around that put that much details in it :)   The community is overall positive , most of the time you will get fun and polite teammates. Beware though there are always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  I recommend buying this when its on sale.   Thank you for taking your time to read this !  Leaving a thumb up and a comment would be a great help !",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Rainbow Six: Siege has surprised me in many positive ways. During it’s original announcement, I was still recovering from the disappointment that was Watch_Dogs, and actually refused to buy Ubisoft games for some time. I’m a huge fan of the older Vegas games, both of which had a strong single player component. So naturally I was even more disappointed when I heard that Siege would be exclusively multiplayer. Little did I know that their multiplayer would be some of the most satisfying I’ve ever played.  Siege has actually taken me away from my regular multiplayer shooter, the largely popular CS:GO of which I’ve been playing since it’s beta. I didn’t even think that was possible, but here I am playing Siege for 2 months with less than 2 hours of CS:GO during that time.   The possibilities in Siege are what make it so addictive. It has destructibility on a more controlled scale than what you would see in the Battlefield games. You can break walls, build barricades, reinforce walls, etc. There are so many ways each round can play out, and so many different tactics you can use to win. The gunplay is highly satisfying, as is expected from the Rainbow Six games which have set a very high standard from the Vegas years.   Rainbow Six Siege feels like the next gen shooter I’ve been waiting for. It’s smooth, elegant, and tons of fun to play for hours on end.",1,1

Are you F***ing kidding me?",1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Rainbow Six Siege is what happens when you mix the brilliance of the intimate counter strike matches with Battlefield Bad Company 2's destructible environments. It is excellent. The most common and most played mode is a 5v5 match. Here you either start out scouting the whole building while playing as Ct or setting up the defense as the Terrorists.   Some of the most tense moments I have ever had outside of horror games is when I wait for the counter terrorists to break in, you hear thumping, blasting, footsteps and all you can do is wait as going out as a lone wolf out there won't be doing you much good.  As Counter terrorists you are given drones in the start for scouting out the terrorists positions and it is actually tougher than it looks as you only know the last tagged position by the drones.   There are plenty of Classes available in Six Siege all with different abilities. You need in game currency called Renowns to buy them. The flow of them is good enough that it does not feel that the game is forcing you to buy them using real world money.   There are other modes like situations and terrorist hunt which help you get familiar with the various operators. Terrorist hunt in particular is excellent when played with friends against higher level of AI. Another thing I like is that you have to reach a specific level before you can enter Ranked matches, which makes you get ready for them.  Rainbow six siege is one of the most brilliant FPS I've played till now and if you like methodical slow , tactical shooters, You can't go wrong with Rainbow Six Siege.",1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege honest review  PROS +Competative multiplayer-based combat +Fun yet challenging side-ops +Completable challenges +Buyable 'operators' +Customizable weaponry +Intriquite map design +Addicting  CONS -Some glitched lobbies, soon to be fixed -Pre-game lag (probably just my pc)  ABOUT THE OPERATORS  Players may buy operators that suit what they like to do, with currency made by doing online and side-ops. Some operators can place a mounted LMG and has perfect armor. Another can place a barricade that can only be blown up, not shot or melee'd. All operators have very particular abilities, none are remotely the same.  THE TEAMS  You can play as either the terrorists or the counterterrorists with 5 on each team. The police, i'll call of counterterrorists, must breach and clear a selected building with the terrorists inside, either rescuing a hostage, securing some toxic ♥♥♥♥, or defusing a bomb. You can place charges that will detonate and destroy only designated destroyable areas. Other gadgets come with the operaters. The terrorists must fortify their position at once. Place heavy barriers on walls and/or floors to prevent breaching. Also place either a mounted shield or barbed wire (you select which one pre-game), Other gadgets will come with the operators.  GAMEPLAY/GRAPHICS  The game is like no other (maybe a little bit Payday 2). The textures of models and the gunfire feels realistic and fun. Feel free to bring down some settings to make it run faster, as it still will look stunning. The gunfire feels kind of crummy, as your gun goes nuts when you pull the trigger (which is a GOOD thing). This game plays like call of duty but has more less-controlled gunfire.   OVERALL SCORE 9.5/10 A masterpiece by my standareds.  Recommended Purchase:  YES",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"This is probably the best multiplayer FPS available right now. It's surprising to say that the devs behind a Ubisoft published game actually seem to care about what they make and what the community thinks because they've been fairly ontop of balancing, issue-fixing and releasing patches and content.   The game is 5v5 in one of three similar game modes where one team defends and one attacks. Each side gets access to a number of 'operators' which are basically the game's versions of classes. Each has a unique ability and particular weapons depending on their CTU. The balancing is great, with each class having direct and indirect counters. Each class has its role and while there are a few that can be ignored they can still prove worthwhile on some maps. All the guns fill a niche and none are there purely for padding, the same can be said for attachments.  Destructability is the primary difference between this and other FPSs. The maps are all CQB and most of the combat happens through a wooden/plaster medium. There are distinctive destructable materials in the walls, floors and ceilings and the key to this game is map knowledge, because you'll know exactly where to punch a hole to get a good sight line or where to blow up for easy entrance into a reinforced room. You can have awful aim, poor crosshair placement and generally just be bad, but if you have map knowledge then you're halfway there to winning. It's a testament to really good level design more than anything.  There are problems though, the netcode being the biggest. I still run into issues of severe peeker's advantage where an enemy can poke out, kill me, and pop back into hiding without me ever seeing them because I've died before the server sends me the information that they're there to begin with. Rubberbanding happens frequently and sometimes searching for a game can take up to five minutes in ranked.  The lack of a singleplayer isn't a bad thing, there are situations to ease you into the game which don't have overdramatic cutscenes, pointless backstory and aren't an extended tutorial. They give you a set loadout and tell you to beat a mission. This lets you get used to the operators, the abilties, the guns and the maps without any unnessecary fluff.  You can play this game solo, although most people don't use microphones or communicate much at all, but it's playable and still fun even in ranked. It's better with friends though since information is the key to winning. I bought the game for €15 as a Starter Edition but considering that it took me only 5 months to acquire nearly half the playtime I have in CSGO which took 4 years, I'd say the game is worth paying €60 for. It also ruined CS for me, by showing me what it's like to play a tactical 5v5 shooter that's actually good.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Well made, fun, polished and balanced game BUT... if ur looking to play competitively in its current state u will be disappointed!  The only problem this game has are the horrible servers. Hit detection is way off and sometimes u die from the position u were 2seconds ago. I also have 80hours in beta's and the servers felt better back then, Its very frustrating and happens very often.  WAIT FOR A NETCODE FIX BEFORE U PURCHASE THIS GAME!!!   UPDATE: (Original post 6th of dec 2015 - update post 6th of feb 2016)  If u are looking to buy this game to mess around with youre friends in casual go ahead.  If ur looking to play a serious ranked game dont waste ur money on R6S.  -Hitbox's are still way off and the gunfights can only be taken seriously half of the time (uncluding highest headshot rate of any game ive ever seen) and im DMG on csgo...  -Match making is a joke... and i still cant believe they allow players to bypass the level20 cap on ranked games if they duo with a friend!!  -Continuous 4v5's due to there not being a reconnect function  -The ranked system itself is also very off... i win 7 games in a row (no rank up) to lose the next 2 games in a row and i got derank, wich led me to this review update.   Review summary: Go back to CSGO : )",1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"I put many hours into the beta, and now into the full game and I'm loving every minute of it.   Do not hesitate to buy this game. Overall fantastic gameplay. It feels very smooth and plays very well. Never thought I'd be uttering these words but.... Good job, Ubisoft.  Also, to those experiencing the Steam/Ubisoft Issue, here's a fix:  1. Copy the Steam game folder 'Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege' located in  C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege  And copy it somewhere for the time being.   2. Now go back and in steam Right click on the game and Delete Local content (This is why we made a copy)  3. Now place the folder back into the same location it was in and then go into the Folder and open the .EXE and Steam will pop up asking you to reinstall the game.  4.Click Okay and Steam should say something along the lines of 'Discovering Existing Files' then your doing it right :)  Now after it is done Click Play and you're all set.",1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"It's like Counter-Strike, but fun. You get to blow up walls, doors and floors. Cool stuff. Theres some underpowered characters, some overpowered ones (that stupid rifle shield and it's free peeks i swear to god), but they're working on it, so that's good. The whole 'free content for everyone' approach is also great, hard to believe it's in a Ubisoft™ game.  Two issues it does suffer from are crappy netcode and the matchmaking. Sure I'm silver, but that doesn't warrant placing a level 41 against a level 170, even if he's also silver.  If you're into competitive FPSs, this is a great tactical one. If the Starter Edition comes up again, don't even waste time pondering it and jump on the Siege train. Great waste of 15€.

This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, it's such a new breath of fresh air within FPSs. It's got the graphics, the gameplay is amazing.  ------------  Learning to play from EVERY AGNLE possible is part of the fun here. Hanging upside down in a window and shooting people is amazingly fun, finding people in MM to breach and clear rooms....holy ♥♥♥♥ it brought me back to my Army days. Never have I felt such fun in a new game until now.   The guns have their limits, but aren't exactly the focus. There's not really a huge balance issue with this game either, most of the time when you die you just get out played.   Every gun has their play style, like shotguns? you actually have to play close to walls or windows and not try to shoot medium to far range.   Like to be able to take out enemies who like to peak from afar? Pick up a rifle  Like to run and gun? Well too bad go back to CoD.  Those who complain about the game are normally the CoD players or Silvers out of CSGO who can't actually aim and need to find something to complain about.

That's better than like 40 or how much R6S is) -Can run on crap PCs (It has the same requirements as HL2, and even my old potato from 2003 can run it)  And that's it. R6S is way better.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"This game is awesome, REALLY awesome but recently, there has been a lot of problems with the comunity, a lot of people on this review page say the comunity is nice and cool, but here's the thing, its changing. For one thing, the amount of TeamKillers has increased dramatically, especially if you play on casual, One time I went into a match on Bank, on offensive and was imediatly killed by a guy, I waited for someone to kill him cause well he was an as@hole, but nobody did, and I realized they didn't because they were playing together, like they knew eachother, and aparrently they wanted to play alone, people like this ruin the game, and ubisoft needs to do something to properly punish players that do this. Also I have recently been encountering nice and friendly people less and less, just more as@holes. There are three kinds of people I play with in this game, mostly guys who dont have mics, don't coordinate and don't comunicate with their team and get themselves killed first, secondly there are asses who will coordinate with you, but insult and criticize you for every mistake you make, (you'll encounter these guys mainly on ranked they don't like inexperienced players) and lastly the friendly people, who are rare now. They will help you give the needed call outs and back you up in a match and those are the best people in this game. And even with everything I said, its still not enough to not recomend this game, just if you are gonna buy it, try to find a clan or just some friends to play it with if you can, cause the randomes are wild cards now, thank you for taking the time to read this review and I hoped it helped you make your decision because this is one of the most tactical and team based multiplayer fps's of this decade and its an amazing accomplishment by Ubisoft.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Most fun i have had with a First Person Shooter in years !  Pros + solid tactical gameplay - you really have to choose your entry points carefully + classes are all fun and exciting to play - each has its own important role + microtransactions arent intrusive , as in they only are for weapon skins and a boost of renown ( which is easy to get in the first place ) + maps always feel like a different experience every single time cause of the way the objective moves around each round , and so it feels like multiple maps in one.  cons - the netcode right now is a bit wonky , but ubisoft is addressing this issue - some people are jerks and teamkill , but doesnt happen that often . in fact its only happened to me once in 30 hours of gameplay - killcams are also jacked up and show someone killing you differently from what you saw  - the open mic issue is annoying    overall i would give this game about an 8/10 and is definitly worth your time!!",1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"As a kid I used to paint and collect Warhammer. I would imagine my warriors battle hoardes of Orcs and Chaos as I played against my brother and my friends. Great heroes and huge, sprawling battles raged in my mind. My brother's Empire troops standing bravely against my vampire hoarde!  The only place I could actually see something akin to these battles was through the Total War franchise with Rome Total War which we also used to play together. Ambushing his Roman column with Gaulic warriors!  I have waited twelve years for this pairing to come along. Even since I heard the announcements I have been eagerly waiting. Despite all of that pressure, the game did not disappoint. The battles that I dreamed of seeing as a kid are coming to life before my eyes.   I now live in the USA and my brother is still in England. We are playing our cooperative campaign to recreate those same rivalries, stories and memories that we would make with our models on our kitchen table as kids. Technology like this makes life better. Three thousand miles apart and yet thanks to this platform we can feel that same joy and excitement that we did back then.  10/10 would make more childhood dreams come true",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I'll start with this; Ooooooh man is this game pretty! I'll follow up with this; Ooooooh man the game runs like a dream!  So yes, I find it hard to describe the feeling of quality the game radiates. Everything just seem to have been worked on until it's as they wanted it, and nothing else. The feeling I get is like the perfect mix between Total War and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.  All the factions are different, not only the units but they also have a faction specific feature, like Offices for Empire, Raise Dead for Vampires, and so on... Playing another faction really is another faction, and not just recoloured units with changed names.  Battles are tough, the AI uses cavalry units so damn well, I keep getting surrounded and hammered on which really have me watch how I do battle more carefully.  Lords (Generals) and Heroes (Agents) now have a very solid skill system, much like a roleplaying game, when they level up. Also, Heroes can actually be in the battle with you, you really get the feeling that this is fantasy, and that these people are something out of the ordinary.  As I said above, it's like the perfect union of Total War and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Diplomacy actually WORKS in this one. As the Empire, I managed to a form a grand alliance between myself, Brettonia and the Dwarves, and everybody teamed up to cancel the apocalypse. You can tell your allies where to put their armies, and coordinate solid strategies to make sure everything goes down as planned.   Probably the best Total War game so far - better even than Shogun 2, since it doesn't have an infuriating realm divide mechanic nor does it have a max number of turns: you keep going until somebody wins.   Balance could probably be better - the Vampire Counts can pull up so many units in a single turn that they're basically unbeatable on the campaign map if you use them at all competently. On the flipside, every Empire unit except STanks and demigryphs just cannot make its upkeep back compared to the other armies' equivalent units.   I do wonder how they're going to fit all the races in their appropriate places without massively redrawing the map, but that's a bidge to cross when we come to it.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Ok so after having played every faction and won on very hard or lengendary (I have a lot of time, not currently working) my personal opinion is this is the best Total war game made so far, previously Shogun 2 was my favorite. I've read some of the negative reviews and I disagree with them for the following reasons.   1) Each faction's play style is vastly different and more different than in any other total war game. Although I loved Shogun 2, at the end of the day each faction you use the same units. Here not only is each faction's units very different, the way you accumulate resources is different. Orcs you have to sack a lot of cities and raid, and you get bonus Waargh! armies if you fight a lot. Empire is a mix of Cavalry, artillery and magic. Vampire is mainly magic based. Dwarves has the best artillery but no cavs, sucks when those stumpy legs have to chase enemies down at the end. Chaos, you have roving mobile bases embedded into your army and you have to constantly sack and raze cities.   2) Gaming experience for each faction is very different. Chaos is the hardest, as soon as you build your second horde the entire world wants to kill you, you basically have to run and sack cities until you get strong enough. Empire is also very hard, you get attacked constantly starting from about turn 35 from chaos and barbarian tribes. Dwarves and orcs are in similar starting positions and very sheltered so if you survive the beginning when everyone's declaring war then it's easy. Vampires are also easy because chaos and the barbarians ignore them until the end.   3) The game is much harder than previous total war games. I've read a lot of negative reviews where people complain that they get wiped out by chaos playing Empire. Dude, THAT'S THE POINT! They're out to wipe out the world! I can't believe people cry about the game being too hard, if it were too easy then people would complain it was too easy.   AI is much smarter now, thank God we don't have the mess from Rome 2 again. It's much harder to get the enemy army units to flee on harder difficulty settings. Again people have complained about this. Well, then play easy, I've tried easy and it's like the other total war games, the enemy breaks easily. But if you play very hard or legendary then you have to fight a perfect battle to win if the odds are against you even slightly.   4) Quest battles. Each of the legendary lords have their own quests which if you win gives you an item. Although not important for winning for a faction it adds a new fun element to the game.   Only downside to the game mechanics which I agree with some negative reviews is that the battles are too quick. Which means unless you're really winning you don't have time to zoom in and watch the cool units doing their thing. But I think the battles were made shorter again to make it harder, you have to micro fast to get units into the right position to win. If watching cool graphics is your thing then play on easy, allows for more time to watch the show.   This is a challenging game. Not everyone's made out to be a general. The ones who are not cry. Really? A game where everyone's out to kill you and you want a walk in the park instead? Go play on easy, the easy setting is there for a reason. So big thumbs up from me for the vastly different play styles of each faction which allows for replayability and the difficulty.  (btw if you're amazed at how much time I've logged in this game, it's because I keep the game running even when I'm out shopping or in the other room watching movies. You're welcome to read the comments section though to see how many aholes there are in this world though who feel like they need to judge and bully people. The funny thing is most are gamers with a lot more games on their accounts than mine)",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I want to start by saying that I have been a fan of Warhammer since I was 8 years old and my stepdad brought over some Lizardmen miniatures for me to play with while he wooed my mom. I have collected several armies over the years, played many games, and given up hours upon hours to reading the novels, looking at the lore, and writing my own adventures in the Old World and beyond. This is and has been my favorite fantasy setting since I was a child. No other world brings all of the greatest fantasy elements together, ties them into an awesome renaissance era, and then adds in death and despair (and crack-addicted ratmen!) by the truckload quite like Games Workshop has with Warhammer. Before you write the rest of this review off as the ramblings of a fanboy, I want you to realize that this absolute love of Warhammer has lead me to hold everything done with IP to the absolute highest standards. I have played every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game that I can find with the Warhammer logo and been grossly disappointed with all of them, with the exception of Vermintide which scratches a completely different itch. Since I was eight years old I have wanted a video game that let me control The Emperors armies, a game that let me see the Old World in all of it's beautiful, deadly detail. Every new Warhammer game I've seen has raised my hopes that this is the game that will let me do that, this is the game that will bring the ridiculously overpriced tabeltop miniatures to life. Every new game has let me down, until now.  Mechanically, this is one solid piece of clockwork. The game is wonderfully optimized, I run it with everything set to ultra and I have yet to see so much as a stutter in my 30 hours, and I do NOT have a top of the line PC. The graphics are great (for a Total War game), and the special effects and monsters all look stunning. Campaign mechanics have been streamlined and simplified to make the empire building aspect of the Total War series fun and less of a hassle. No longer do you have to worry about food, or sanitation, fertility. Public order is now the only number the player must keep track of. No longer do you have to look at a building and decide if the -12 public order is worth the 10% increase to your soldier's armor. Now buildings either let you recruit units or give you positive effects. That isn't to say that it makes empire building easier, just less of a chore. You still need to plan out your building slots rather well, as you only have a select few in each province.  New mechanics are brought into the campaign map as well, and these are well done and add a nice, new layer to the depth presented by the game. One of these is corruption. Certain factions bring corruption to the lands. This is generally done slowly and with little notice until it seems all at once that it hits you. Corruption brings about public order penalties to factions that don't use them, as well as attrition for their armies. This can be countered by certain buildings and heroes. Sieges have been revamped, so now instead of attacking the entire city you only attack a single stretch of the walls. While it makes the battles simpler, it also allows for the AI to stand with the player on even footing, and it makes the sieges more fun. In Rome 2 and Attila I found myself auto-resolving almost every single siege because of how lackluster and boring they were. In TW:Warhammer I don't auto-resolve sieges at all, because they are fun and exciting. It's fantastic watching my units of Orcs fight for supremecy on the Dwarven walls.  Speaking of heroes, they are the replacer for agents. On the campaign map they are exactly like the agents of old, however they have a new ability, and that is the action that lets them join an army. When embedded into an army, a hero fights on the battle map along with the army, and they are awesome. They look great and have awesome special abilities to boot. Lords replace the generals, and are much better. They stand alone, but are tougher and more resilient than the general's units of past games. They also collect followers, weapons, armor, and gear that can all be equippied to them and the heroes of your choosing.  The AI is much smarter than previous Total War games, though that's not to say that it doesn't act stupid at times. All too often have I requested peace from a faction, just to be denied and then offered peace and a fat purse for accepting the offer a turn later. It makes no sense. On the battlefield the AI is a lot smarter as well, able to use the new units just as well if not better than me at times. Speaking of the new units...Warhammer fits in perfect with Total War. Most of the new creatures and units are incredibly detailed, and bring about new facets to the battlefield. Flying units, giant monsters and magic are all welcome editions to the age old Total War formula, and they fit in so well. Battlefields are so much more intense when there are steam tanks fighting dragons than they ever could be with Romans fighting Carthagenians. That's not to say that battles got a lot more complicated, either. The special abilities of units (like spearwalls for hoplites) have been removed, with spearmen bracing themselves against charges automatically if they're standing still. This is good, because the special abilities that Lords, Heroes, Wizards, and magic items can be complicated enough when you have a lot of them, and sometimes can turn into micro-managing hell. While battles are still complex, chaotic messes, it's at least manageable given all that is going on.  The five factions are all unique, both on the campaign map and the battle map, which adds a lot of replayability to the game. I've read complaints that the end-game is repetitive because all factions have to beat Chaos back to the wastes at the end, but I don't really know what else they were expecting. Chaos has always been the big bad of the Warhammer World, so it makes sense that a finale would consist of beating them down, hard. All in all, well done.  Now, for all of the praise, this game still has it's negatives, but they are few and far between. The biggest issue seems to be with balance. Some damage spells are extremely powerful, able to wipe out high-tier units with a single cast, while most aren't even worth their casting cost at all. Agent actions are also overpowered, doing huge amounts of damage to entire armies while costing very little.  There are other things that bother me, too, when it comes to staying with the lore of the world. The minor human nations have been extremely generalized, receiving mostly reskinned Empire units. This is sad, because these nations are important to the lore. While I understand that they're not nor will they be playable, that doesn't mean that on the campaign map they shouldn't be fleshed out even a little. I mean come on, Kislev doesn't even get the Tsarina Katerina as their leader, instead they recieve a generic Empire lord!   Certain locations also don't receive the attention that they should. Certain Empire cities are supposed to be works of art, yet are just generic versions of each other. Dwarfen holds aren't even close to how they're described in the lore. Also, factions are missing entire chunks of their rosters, which I'm willing to bet will be added with DLC. I'm not even upset about that, because I'm used to GW practices of nickel and diming you, so that was to be expected. The game even has mod support, something I never thought possible with GW involved. The game isn't perfect, but CA has worked very hard for a very long time to make it what it is, and it is great. You can immediately tell the amount of love that the game has been given, and if more games were given this amount of attention to detail, we would all live in a better place with better games.  9.5 out of 10, Great job Creative Assembly",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Usually I am too lazy to write reviews. But right now I am slightly drunk and feel the sudden urge to express myself. Because of that, and since the gloomy 'Mixed' on top of this page bothered me for some time now, I decided to do something about that.  If you are not a fan of reading more than five sentences at a time, better stop right now and just trust the big 'Recommended' atop this review. Or decide that I am not trustworthy and smash the dislike button, I don't really care.   First off, I played every Total War game since Rome and enjoyed most of them, even the universally hated Rome II (at least after a year of patches). Usually I kept to playing campaigns; custom battles, be it single- or multiplayer, never really tickled my fancy.  On the other hand, I never really got into Warhammer before, thus I was skeptical at best when I heard about this game. But yet I bought it shortly after release as a despereate attempt to get out of my post-Witcher 3 depression. Surprisingly, I was not dissatisified.  The biggest asset of this game, in my opinion, is the diversity of the playable races. For one, each faction has some unique mechanics which nicely blend in with the whole setting; orcs accumulate 'fightiness' to get free Waaagh-armies, vampires can instantly summon whole armies from the dead, etc. Secondly, each faction focuses on different unit types, far more extremely than in every previous Total War game, where I basically played all factions mostly the same. For example, dwarves feature a batch of armored units with big guns and heavy infantry but without any cavalry while vampires completely renounce ranged combat and instead rush hordes of zombies, skeletons and monsters into the enemy.  Then there is the addition of flying units and magic. I initally feared that this would be impossible to bring into accordance with classical Total War combat, but the developers somehow managed to balance those features pretty well. Magic is useful but not overpowered, flying units are dangerous if kept unchecked, yet there are effective ways to defend against them. So you basically get new possibilities to fight your battles without making traditional strategies obsolete.  Still, the game is definitely not flawless (as you might have already guessed reading some of the other reviews). The campaign AI is crappy as ever, always trying to get a single win but never planning two steps ahead. Diplomacy has not seen much improvement either, which is also mainly an AI problem; alliances don't mean much, non aggression pacts are broken with no repercussions, suitable trade partners are hard to come by. I nearly almost end up being at war with everyone. Furthermore, many aspects of the campaign gameplay were simplified compared to previous Total War games, which is however not necesserily a bad thing. Being honest, Total war games were (as far as I remember) never really deep in terms of economy, city building and politics. So, if you are looking especially for those features and don't care much about the real time battles, this is probably not the right game for you.  At last, a few words regarding all the DLC hate: Yup, they are overpriced, but they still sell. Therefore big greedy Publishers like SEGA will continue this trend and ignore your pretty middle finger comments. Just don't buy them, if you don't want to support that, no one forces you. Or wait for a nice sale. The base game is nonetheless worth it and occasionally there are some free goodies.  There are many more points I could get into, positive ones (lords, heroes, quest battles, campaign map, ...) as well as negative ones (no naval combat, simplified battle maps, unaccurate auto-resolve, ...), but I have the feeling that I was getting too verbose already. There's probably a reason I don't write reviews. All in all I will now just conclude that this is definitely my favorite Total War game so far, and, regarding the battles, probably the most entertaining strategy game I know.   So if you read all this: I am sorry. If not: Didn't I tell you to go away with my fourth sentence?",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is Stephen. Stephen's game crashed on startup. Stephen went to reddit, Total War twitter, and read other reviews. Stephen found out that he could go into Offline mode and this may fix the problem. Stephen fixed his problem, and vanquished the enemies of the Empire. Stephen did not run to the review page and leave a bad review for a problem Stephen knows will be fixed very soon.  Don't be a ♥♥♥♥.  Be like Stephen.  EDIT: Here is my review for those complaining there isn't one here. But before that I just want to say my initial review was to point out that, devs are people. They make mistakes. There was a small issue causing this bug and that you should have waited it out before kneejerking it to the review page, give people the benefit of the doubt before you condemn them - especially after only a couple hours of release. The issue I had was patched within hours of release. Now, if the game was STILL unplayable, I might march to a different tune. But don’t be so damn negative right off the bat people, life is much easier if you're an optimist. Also, if you gave the game a bad review for that issue but are now crushing little dwarfs with your trolls, you might change your review :)   Now for my thoughts: The game is amazing. I've been playing Total War games since 2005 and this is by far the best Total War game to date. In previous TW games you’ve played as humans, obviously, and while this is cool to be historically accurate, what it meant was that all the playable factions were basically some variation of the other with differences in culture. In TW:WH, each faction is COMPLETELY different. The tactics you learned as the Empire will NOT hold when fighting as the Vampire. Plus, each faction has their own campaign aspect, the Empire can appoint Lords to offices that give bonuses, the Vamps have to have lands be corrupted before entering them, otherwise they take attrition, the Dwarfs have a book of grudges that each grudge has to be “settled”, and the Greenskins have to maintain a level of “fightiness” within their armies or else they start in-fighting and take attrition. What all this means, is that when you start a new campaign, it feels like a whole new game almost.   Also, the UI in this game is a MASSIVE improvement over Rome II and Attila. Now you can understand what buildings you need where to get what. Gone are the days of going down the rabbit hole of the building browser trying to figure out what does what and how it will all play out. The message system is sooo much better. Many times in the prev TW games you’d start a turn and have to click through 4-5 pop up messages then there would be 10 more side ones to go through. They’ve boiled it down to what's important and overall I think have hit the right balance between complexity and depth and learnability. After all, this is nowhere as deep as like EUIV or Civ 5, but its similar, I mean the point of this game is to get more armies to smash other armies.  Now for the battles, HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THEY ARE AWESOME. The feeling of watching your Demigryph Knights slam into the back of an unsuspecting unit of little Dwarfs and watching them fly through the air cannot properly be described in words. Where TW has sort of simplified the campaign, they added complexity to the battlefield. No more of the rock, paper, scissors formula of the old TW games where spears beat cav, cav beat swords, and swords beat spears. Now you have flying monstrous units, trolls, undead armies that can pop up from the ground, gunnery, infantry, giant comets of magic that rain from the sky and hexes that curse your men.I feel like some of the magic will need some balancing especially since magic damage does not scale with unit size. But over all battles are awesome. It definitely will take some time to master but it is so much fun trying to figure it out.   Performance wise, I think it's great, I got a GTX 970 W/ i7-6700k, and while in the campaign get a smooth 90 fps on high and 50-60 on ultra, in battle usually 75-80 on high and 40-50 on ultra with few dips, even if there are a ton of units. I've only had one game crash, but no big deal! Overall I give it a 9/10. If you’re new to TW, start here! The prev TW games are much more complicated and sometime unnecessarily. TW:WH struck the right balance and I definitely recommend it.   TL;DR - best TW game yet. All the races feels completely different, the UI is waaay better, battles are great, challenging, and loads of fun and the game is well optimized and runs good.   Cheers :)",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Creative Assembly has gotten alot of flak for their DLC model down here, but the truth of the matter is this is a review section to tell people how the game plays and how well it plays and if the initial game is worth the price point, not a rant forum for problems people have with CA and Sega's DLC model.   Q: Without any DLC does this game feel complete and polished and worth the $60 USD? A: Yes, in my opinion it does. Without any DLC I logged over 100 hours in this game, and if you play every campaign available you will likely get a ton of in game time before you even approach needing DLC. Every single race plays differently in campaign. They have unique areas of the map to deal with and unique challenges they all face. Most of them have totally different campaign mechanics to learn before you can really get a handle on that races playstyle. It is without a doubt, a complete game with the initial 4 playable races.  Now if you want to complain that the DLC isn't worth the money, is unpolished or incomplete that is a different thing altogether and would totally belong here but its all just complaining that they feel entitled to free stuff any time its added into a game but the truth is, we as gamers, and consumers, are not. Even if making games is CA's dream, it's still a business and to make more content to add to a game costs money. People don't get college degrees to work for free.   Gamers giving this game a bad review because of a company policy are doing this game an injustice. The game is amazing in my opinion and very much worth the price point. Their complaints about DLC policy shouldn't be aired on a review of the game because this review section is for GAME REVIEWS. Not a forum for complaints about a company. Please, go to the Creative Assembly forums and let them know what you think there. ",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"When I first heard about a fantasy universe in a Total War game I shook my head in disapproval.  I was stuck in the mindset that TW need its origins in real-world history and realism – boy was I wrong.  The squalor, food and aging is removed to give room for the fantasy to shine, and it delivers.  You no longer have to worry about your mighty captain(in this game lord) becoming a victim of aging or falling in a surprise battle. Your ”Legendary Lords” will always be there(if you can avoid a 5 turn assasination wound recovery) and you never feel your progress getting lost or wasted – it's honestly great.  It means that you can put your entire heart and soul into becoming the mightiest Lord, without worrying about inevitable death. Needless to say that this fits a fantasy universe perfectly.  As a new feature your Lord is now a single person instead of being part of a squad, which works wonders – you will no longer suffer from random unlucky deaths of your lord, by simply being unlucky with who dies in his squad. The single unit now works off of a pool of HP, which eliminates that element of luck that haunted killing a captain in previous TW games. As the game progresses and your lord earns levels through glorious combat, he will get some unique questlines to fulfill in order to gain high tier loot, such as powerful weapons and armor – really satisfying and worthwhile to complete. Usually with a fun battle(including cutscene) to end it.  Diplomacy is miles apart from all other TW games – way better, with AI that actually doesn't seem to be controlled by your dog and actively engages in diplomacy.   Those were som quick thoughts – 100% recommended as the best TW game so far.",1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"As the Slayer King, my first battle was against some green skins that were in the lands around my home and mountain stronghold of Karaz-a-Karak. Victory came for me but at a hefty cost as I lost almost as many warriors as my enemy. They retreated back to the shack made of rotten wood and rusted metal that they called a town, while I stayed in my territory, licking my wounds, replenising my crippled army. I reviewed the Dwarvern Emo diary, AKA The Book of Grudges, to see what I could do to rally the hordes of crybaby dwarf citizens at my command. I readied myself to take the Orc settlement, just a few more turns to gather my strength... The next turn, a goblin army from a neighbouring region charged at my army's flank, ruining my plans. 'Why didn't I go back to safety of my stronghold!' I said, chastising myself. I was now being attacked by a healthy, rested and eager Goblin army, baying for my blood, meanwhile the Orc army that I had defeated, also joined the fray.  Outnumbered almost 3 to 1, I started the battle, positioning my troops at the crest of a hill, having plenty of time to maneuver as the sheepish Goblin army moved to join their wounded Orc allies. I waited. A line of Thunderers and another of Quarrellers stood in line, ready to shoot. Victory was unlikely, but maybe I could pull off a miracle. It was then that the miracle presented itself. I noticed the Orc Warchief at the front of their lines, severely wounded from our last encounter... If I could just take him out, the low morale of the Orcs and Goblins might shift in my favour.  The warchief entered my range and my Quarrellers unleashed their crossbow bolts. As he came even closer, my Thunderers opened up. It was then that the Warchief dropped dead; his body riddled with crossbowbolts and shot. It was as if the ancestors themselves smiled upon the bravery of my men and smote my enemies down for their hubris.  The remains of the Orc army instantly routed, charging from the field. I turned the eagerness of my ranged infantry to the more pressing matter of the Goblins. Goblin spearmen charged at my wounded men, enveloping them in a sea of green slimey flesh and primitive spears. They fought hard, standing their ground and finally got the edge again when the Slayer king himself jumped into the tide, immediately flinging half a dozen tiny goblin bodies down the hill. Still, I was heavily outnumbered. Desperate times call for desperate measures. As my Longbeards and Slayers kept the goblins occupied, I marched my ranged units down the hill towards their Goblin shaman who sat toward the back of their ranks. I opened fire with all the fury my men could muster, wounding the fragile leader. Being on the outskirts of the mob, the Slayer king met with the Shaman, leader to leader. As it turns out, a Goblin Shaman is no match for the King of the Slayers, and soon he fell to his axe. With their leaders gone, the Goblins began to fall in droves. They soon realised that it was hopeless as the Thunderers and Quarrellers joined the fight, supplementing their arsenal for the shield on their backs. The rest of the Goblins fled; my men cut some of them down, but alas, it was a luxury that Dwarves, being much slower than Goblins, would not be able to take advantage of. It didn't matter, against the odds, we had won.   With two of their leaders dead, I felt satisfied that we had done enough damage for one day and I easily occupied their settlement, replacing wood and rusted iron with stone and steel. I nestled in my new settlement, my men gaining much needed respite and reinforcements. I crossed another whiney errand (read: grudge) from my Emo book of dark poetry, assured in the knowledge that the Dwarves wouldn't drown me in their tears - at least not for another turn or two.  I love this game.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've just finished a ~23 hour Dwarf Campaign before writing this review.  This review is targeted towards those familiar with other TW games. For newer players let me just say that this game is a perfect starting point if you are looking to get into the series.    PROS:   - Campaign : I was always detracted from finishing Long Campaigns before - it was often grindy and finishing was just a formality. The restrictions to settling in this game actually help with this. It allows you to interact with other Factions as friends/foes rather than 'future property of me'. I was skeptical with this change but it gave a refreshing amount of direction to my campaign. That said, I am still going to use the upcoming conquer the map mod, but perhaps not all of the time. The Chaos event was fun in a way that wasnt also annoying (I'm looking at you Rome II IA civil war).  - Combat : Combat is meaty. Cannons sound amazing, lords smack away soldiers like Sauron from Lord of the Rings, unit design and animations utilize the fantasy setting very well. Map Landscapes are varied and gorgeous. In all, I found myself using auto resolve less than my first campaigns in other titles. UI and control is closest to Attila.  - Difficulty : There was an artifical difficulty on easy/normal in the last titles where you would have hordes of one-city factions with an army or two complicating your movements. In this game, Confederations are usually established by the midgame, allowing much more epic fights with much more balanced enemies. The easy/normal difficulties have never been more accurate. I have yet to test higher but I've watched HeirofCarthage (Hard/VH) and LegendofTotalWar (Legendary) and I can say that challenge is alive in full force. You can take a look at thier LPs to be the judge.  - Depth : 'Generals' and 'Agents' have a depth that was previously only achived with mods like TTT. If you play Chaos and want to field lots of armies, you might choose to be a better leader for marauder units since you will have a lot of them. If you play Dwarves like me, you can make your general better at setting up underground ambushes for all of those pesky orks. This can only get better with expansions and mods. The faction leader quests involve epic scripted battles that were tons of fun.  - System : I would be shocked if I had to wait over 10 seconds for an end turn in my first campaign. Most were ~5 seconds. I have an i5-4690 with the game loaded on an SSD. With a GTX 970 I was able to run on ultra with only a few frames dropped here and there. Though not everyone plays with my system this is a 'Pro' since on the same system, both Rome II and Attila run much much worse.    CONS:   - Towns : Towns have not have a lot of depth since Empire (maybe Shogun 2). Besides a few regions that have a special building chain to encourage you to think, you will very quickly find the right buildings to build in your 6/4/4/4. I think this was the intent. I suggest a return to population and more ways to affect region wealth outside of buildings and building modifiers. Popluation/taxes/trade/wealth made Empire one of my favorites despite the awful combat and AI. Food and Sanitation are gone. I don't mourn thier passing but it does leave less to manage.  - Agents : It is difficult to keep up with the AI in terms of agent levels. In the early game (on easy) the AI was fielding lvl 11 agents while I had lvl 4. Success against AI agents was in the range of 20% with an equal amount to injury. Enemy agents would succeed often and kill my own making it ever more diffucult to catch up. Deployment grants almost no exp (a level every 8 turns or more). It seems the game wants you to utilize army placement but even then I could not keep up. I think the numbers just need a small revisiting to fix this issue. You get agent spammed less but your agents feel about as useful in campaign action as in Empire Total War (pretty bad).   I am happy this review is done because I really want to start another campaign. This game is a must buy for TW veterans or fans of the Warhammer IP as it fits with the gameplay so well.  TLDR; Yes - buy.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I'm a simple man. I play the game,  I enjoyed the game, I upvote the game.  I would consider this the best Total War game since their last masterpiece; Shogun 2",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Cavalry charges actually work again, units have weight, and factions have variety again. A good return to form after Rome II and especially the factional blandness of Attilla . Runs reasonably well, comparable to Rome 2, but don't expect to run it at ultra 60fps unless you have topend hardware, and even then it may be iffy. AMD users supposedly should get better performance due to hardware based Asynch Compute when running in DX12, but as an Nvidia user I can't confirm that.  Loading times are a bit iffy, but I won't say for sure as I am running a budget harddisk, so it may simply be the system. However if you were the type to play Divide Et impera mod for R2, it is much faster, but that's more a comment on DEI than TW:W. Conversely, turn times are perhaps the fastest they've been since Mideval 2. And difficulty. This is perhaps one of the most ball busting TWs yet, which some may find good, others less so.  Lastly MP. I have no idea how the MP is because the servers are completely hammered right now because of launch, but sadly from previews I can say it is more of R2 and Attilla style MP than the Avatar Conquest of Shogun. There is a mod on the workshop that moves the secondary Lord to a new faction of the same race, and I highly reccomend it for co-op play so you can both be the same race however.  Edit: No idea why, but texture detail seems to have a massive framerate impact. Dialing it down from Ultra to High made it so I could run at a decent 40-50fps in battles with an aging GTX 760. Probably the first time I've had texture detail severly effect framerate as opposed to just causing loading issues or ram issues.  Edit 5/26: The game has been out 51 hours and I've logged 30. That should sum it up.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I read The Hobbit as a Freshman in highschool in 1979. I started playing Advanced D&amp;D later that year, and Dungeon Mastered my first game on Dec. 31, 1979. We played well into the morning and everyone crashed in chairs and couches after the sun had come up. We didn't play any other than AD&amp;D until the mid to late 80's but when we did we tried them all. Paladium and all of their stuff from Rifts to Beyond the Supernatural, Shadown Run, Champions you name it. We picked up Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and ate it up. During that time we played a lot of Games Workshop stuff. Talisman, Hero's Quest, Battle Master, and of course Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Games Workshop always put out great stuff with awesome back stories that set the perfect atmosphere of each adventure. When computers rolled around in the 90's we saw the potential and would fantasize about the possibilities of going to these places virtually and see all the places we had played for so many years. We started in Ultima Online I stayed there way past their peak, then ended up in WOW for 7 years or so. Everyone wants to complain about the price of DLC's. I paid 15 a month for WOW for years and always thought it was worth the money. Now one of those games we used to play back in the day has come out. Total War Warhammer has captured those awesome backstories and set that perfect atmosphere that great games always do. The game is completely flexible to allow expansion and easily changed to make it what ever you think it should be. Add some units with a mod, or pay for a DLC if you want, but you don't have to. I absolutely love this game and I want it to be successful. I don't have any problem paying for DLC as long as they don't get too expensive. So far so good! I like what I see! They have made an old gamer happy! Hopefully I'll retire one day with the complete world at my fingertips and ride off into a magical sunset. Pretty scary thought. Anyway, I do recomend this game!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,Leaving the 'historically correct' settings was probably the best possible thing for the TW-series. This is the most enjoyable campaign I've ever played in a TW-game and I have a hard time going back to the older games.  Highly recommended!,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"First Campaign in this game, hard difficulty. I pick Chaos, with Archaon as a legendary lord. Turn 2, I attack a town, I make my army suicide itseft, rushing straight into a trap. I lose the campaign, but...

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Steam reviews are the youtube comments of reviews. It is a cesspool of negativity just like YELP or any other public review forum.  Straight off the bat I can tell you this is far and away a total war game that really drew me back into the fold with RTS. Each faction plays in a completely different fashion from the other, game mechanics are on point, magic offers unique strands of strategy. Monsters and flying units just absolutely re-haul the game.   This negative press is mainly because of DLC, which is upsetting. Most people have enjoyed the game and are using this recommendation system as a method in which to 'protest'. Call of the beastmen easily offered me 20 hours+ of gameplay.   Don't listen to the steam reviews. If you want to know if you'll enjoy a game, go to youtube and gameplay videos of Total War Warhammer. A few minutes of gameplay footage is more likely to help you determine whether or not a game will be up to your preferences than Steam reviews.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Alright... where to start... First off this game is a fantastic addition to the Total War series after the past few duds (Rome 2 and Attila) put out by CA since Shogun 2. The races feel unique, interesting, and powerful in their own ways. There are 4 base races to choose from Empire (Men), Orks, Vampire Counts, and finally the Dwarfs.   One improvement to the series is a more in depth character build system which truly makes your characters feel unique and special with the you being able to make your general a good fighter in their own right, a good behind the scenes leader and caster, or focus on campaign traits and use them to quell public order issues and lower vampiric or chaos corruption. On top of this system is the quest chains for the Legendary Lords which provide them with some of their unique gear and weapons from the TT game. This gear provides interesting benefits such as improved stats, better abilities, and sometimes allows your Lord to access a lore of magic (in the case of Azhag the Slaughterer).   In my opinion the graphics are definitely a step up from what they were in Attila and the gameplay is fairly fluid, although the AI will have some hiccups sometimes (but this isn't a huge issue).   Now... should you feel absolutely obligated to buy the DLCs? Short answer: no. While the DLC adds extra options to the base game, the base game itself has enough content to keep you occupied. Some complaints I have seen is that some of the DLC, namely the Campaign Packs are a tad overpriced, my opinion is that they are certainly above what I expected but not unreasonable in my eyes. Otherwise the DLCs released so far have been solid and did add some good stuff to the game.   Look, the way I see it, the game is a gem. This is certainly a big improvement over the last few Total War games. For former Warhammer Fantasy players, this game even with the DLC, is a steal compared to the price we have had to pay for miniatures in the past from Games Workshop. I give this game a 10/10. Great base game with few complaints from me, the DLCs are good BUT... if you want to buy the Campaign Pack DLCs, I would wait for a sale. Factions packs will probably be in the similar realm as what Warriors of Chaos is priced at ($8 US if I'm not mistaken) which I find to be a fair price even without a sale, while Blood and Gore ($2.99 US) is behind a paywall so that CA could keep the games rating down to attract a larger audience.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Terrible DLC policy, awesome game. I'll give it a thumbs up, because I know the complete-edition is going to be amazing!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War Fantasy  Yes, I bought all the DLC No, half shouldn't be DLC Yes, I enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game regardless  9/10  Update: I'm lovin' the elves ;)",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"The game has the seal of of the Elector Counts.  I go for immersion when I play so, for me, the greatest feature is the ability to choose a race that fits your play style the best. Of the 5 races in the game, I've played as 3. Here are their stories:  Dwarves: They fight to reclaim lost lands. When you use them, you have to play defensively. You drive the hordes of Greenskins from your mountains and right the ancestral wrongs. They are a slow campaign. But honestly, nobody ever looked at a Dorf and thought, 'This guy... this guy's on the track team.' God, watching their stumpy march drives me crazy. Love their variety of artillery though. And they have flamethrowers. You can literally kill things with fire.  Vampire Counts: Total Subjugation. The Vampire Count armies have two flavors. Monsters and undead trash. I went the undead trash route and threw endless armies of zombies at everything until their heroes fell under the weight of the dead. It's got a kind of shambling majesty when you watch 3000 zombies and skeletons just engulf a formation of shining Brettonian Knights. You know they're doomed. But you kinda want to seem them put up a fight.  Chaos: FHOORR KAAOSSS. My personal favorite. No worrying about settlements. No worrying about income. No worrying about Diplomacy. You just run your angry armored Ape train through every settlement in the old world. They are awesomely terrifying because they seem so ANGRY.  I have 2 complaints.   The first and most irksome is that the multiplayer is exceptionally bare bones and offers no ranking or matchmaking. It's a mess and a downgrade from previous Total Wars. The Generals (Lords) have fixed skill trees that do not allow you customize the lord to complement your army. A pity because the lords in this game are such engines of destruction/ paladins of buffing. I feel this could have been easy to implement. The lack of ranking also makes this a distasteful affair.  The other complaint is the lack of giblets and entrails. Not really a complaint. When the Blood and Gore DLC comes out, I better see people exploding into bloodmist and leaving bits and pieces everywhere or I'm telling Khorne. And he'll f you up.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"very rare i'll write a review, but by far the best total war game since Rome 1 imo, haven't personally came across any bugs, and apart from the launch issues (i'd only been trying for 5 minutes to get the game working before the hotfix came available) its been a flawless experience, a must have for any total war or warhammer fan!  edit:  So after 14 hours of gameplay i'll go a little bit more indepth to try and help people make up their minds on the game with all the mixed reviews that are kicking about.  To start off with, if you have a reasonably new pc you will have absolutely no issues at all running this game, my cpu is a FX-9370 and my gpu is a Sapphire R9 380 4gig, the campaign runs smooth at 1920x1080 with no stuttering whatsoever, the transition to battles from the campaign map is a lot faster than previous total war games (approx 30 seconds) and then the actual battles run fine on ultra settings as well (again running at 1920x1080).  The only time i had to turn the graphics down to High was when me and 3 friends decided to play vs 4 AI on the largest unit sizes and everyone having a 20 stack (80x80).  I've played both multiplayer battles and multiplayer co-op campaign and have yet to experience any desync issues myself either (which i know was a big issue on some of the previous games).  So far i've only had a quick play around with Chaos and Empire so can't really give any feedback on the Orcs, Dwarfs or Vampire Counts.  --Chaos-- -Nice selection of units and also having to decide which god you want to worship giving different bonuses and penalties. -Horde units (so you don't technically have to upkeep towns except the embedded buildings in the army) (changed faction after i lost my units for taking a stupid battle so i'll come back to chaos after more game time)  --Empire-- -Plenty of diversity within the faction roster so you can build your armies your own way! -Although the game suggests that they are the 2nd easiest to play as at the start things are a bit chaotic to begin with. Surrounded by orcs, dwarfs and rebellious empire factions that all want to wipe you out! -Easy to manage your towns when you get to grip with the new set up. -Hard difficulty is actually Hard, i've had to restart 4-5 times due to making silly errors and getting punished by surrounding factions.  Lastly Cons and Pros imo --Pros-- -Smart AI when playing on hard and above (haven't tried on Normal or Easy), if you declare war on an AI to your east, expect opportunist rival factions surrounding you to declare war on you and try to grab land whilst your armies are nowhere to be seen. -Graphics are amazing and the game is well optimized. -All factions are different and suit a different play style! (obviously). -Ease to join friends games (steam overlay actually works to invite and join friends).  --Cons-- -As empire when you unlock a new unit, e.g. you start off with 'spearmen' and unlock 'spearmen with shields', there isn't an option to upgrade the base unit to the upgraded like in previous total war games, you have to dismantle your army and re-recruit the ugraded units. Not sure if this is intentional or a bug? -Tutorial for non experience total war players can be a bit underwelming, doesn't really go in to a lot of detail when it comes to hero skills and town management. -Bretonnian units and bases are in the game but aren't a playable faction at the moment on the campaign map. (ye ok i'm a bretonnian fanboy).  If your new to Total War games start off by playing on Easy or Normal, if your experience with Total War games get the difficulty cranked up and have fun :) Hope this helps!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,After the launch debacle that was Rome 2 total war i swore that i would never pre order or maybe even buy a total war again. Now here i am after playing over 150 hours of Total War Warhammer and i think it is worth every penny.  Yes i get it the DLC policy is kinda Overpriced and maybe some of those things should have been in the main game from the start but really.... In my opinion this is the best Total war so far and i can only say i can recommend anyone that loves RTS games or maybe u just like fantasy. There are moments in battle where i get that Lord of the Rings movie feel and that is prolly the best compliment i can give the game.  Finally the last thing i want to add is that this game will become way bigger then it is now in terms of content. Many cool DLC and FLC (Free downloadable content) is being added on a 2 month basis or so. I love this game and i am sure within 2 years i will have more then 1000 hours played!,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is the best total war ever created.   Units and building have distinct purposes like in Shogun 2, no more choosing between 15 varieties of the same and looking through dozens of small buffs and debuffs. It is as hectic as Atilla, and it has hordes. It has a theme which is as great as Rome (let's forget Rome 2 ever existed). Combat makes sense like in Medieval 2, before the synced animations were introduced. I... wish I could say something about Empire. Maybe when naval battles come? For the first time factions play very different from each other.   And it runs well! And diplomacy makes sense! Kinda! Most of the time, anyway.  Finally, CA, after few years of experimentation and blunders, you made a game that is awesome as a complete package. ",1,1

A dev team who listens and communicates with the community? Yes.  If you have the cash, this game is highly recommended. There's no strategy game (turn-based and real-time) that can give you the epic experience of W:TH. The DLC do add up but they are added to the campaign whether or not you purchase them; you just can't play as them.",1,1

Total War: Warhammer seems to be a return to form for Creative Assembly, having pulled their heads out of their asses and delivered possibly the best Total War experience I've encountered yet.... having warhammer in there doesn't hurt either.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"• An AMAZING game • Fun and complex battle &amp; campaign system • Beautiful sceneries  • Rich and deep lore  = Everything I want from a fantasy strategy game!  I am a huge fan of both Total war &amp; Warhammer, and I have now played almost 600 hours on one of the most amazing strategy games ever made. The world has not witnessed such an incredible masterpiece in the Total war series since Shogun 2.   First, the only question I feel is worth asking: Is this game fun and will you spend time on it?   Answer: YES, this game gives an incredible deep and rewarding experience. It is incredibly fun and surprisingly addictive. Total war Warhammer is the first game to give same feeling of “just one more turn” since Civ 5. There is allot of different aspects of the game due to the 6 playable races and the countless legendary lords you can start with. It combines many new aspects during battle, like varied units, lords, heroes, magic, beast and monsters which adds up to a fantastic and varied experience. Plus, the game features fun campaign systems accompanied with great graphics and beautiful sceneries. I spend almost half my time just watching reviews of battles and going through the lore. In addition, the game is really difficult and complex (which is a must for me at least).   Second, I must mention the negative aspects of this game:  It's expensive with terrible DLC policy (which is the only reason for negative reviews on this game). If you are a casual gamer that only plays a game for a month or two and then buy a new one, this game is not for you.   Non-the-less, you will without a doubt spend hours and hour on this exhilarating game! And the best part is that the Warhammer universe contains countless new races, lords, units, magics, continents and features that will be included in the future.  So please consider buying this amazing game if you want a complete fantasy strategy-game experience that will last for many years.  I can highly recommend Total war: Warhammer!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I have played every total war game that has been released so far. Unfortuntely, the last TW game that I was satisfied with was Rome Total War, the first one.    Empire Total War felt like a prototype rather than an actual game, suffering from some nasty bugs, silly AI (much more silly than normal) and horrible performance optimisation.  Shogun TW was decent, yet limited in scope and play. It's main flaw was limited replay value. Shogun 2 was popular and score a lot of points with the fanbase, but I absoloutely hated its cheating blatant AI which was more apparent this time round and enemy agent spams (something that Warhammer suffers from at the moment sadly).  Rome 2: Total War had to be one of the franchises biggest launch disappointments. A lot of the issues got fixed by the time Empire edition came around, but by then it was too late. Rome 2 has a bad interface, terrible politic mechanics and mundane boring micromanagement features such as the leveling up of your leaders, which ended up becoming less of a chore in Warhammer.  The Total War series has been on a losing streak since Rome Total War, trying to recapture the magic that the iconic R:TW is known for. Until now...  Warhammer Total War has finally taken the mantle as the best Total War game since Rome, and sits loftly on its throne, goading and chiding all its previous titles like an angry Thorgrim Grudgebearer reading through his Grudgebook.   Thankfully, the reputation for the Total War series has been salvaged, one less grudge to be concerned about. Warhammer is not only a solid release - minus the few remaining bugs - but its also has solid performance, and a solid stable multiplayer that I've been enjoying far too much.  Right away its easy to see that Creative Assembly have poured their hearts and souls into this title. They clearly love the Warhammer Universe and have done it great justice. As a fan of Warhammer, its lore and a current active GM for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, I would be the first to jump down their throats if they messed up this title as its very close to the heart, and its good to know that they have done it justice.  Now, some minor gripes do remain, mostly lore ones: The colours of most of the state troops are wrong for the various Empire provinces, as are the appearance of some of the Elector Counts, I'm looking at you Boris Todbringer!  Yet these are just a drop in the ocean, and issues like these can be readily fixed by mods and such.   Leveling up skills of your leaders was a complete chore in Rome 2, uninteresting, annoyingly mundane and full of micromanagement. However, in Warhammer Total War, all that has changed. You still level up your heroes and leaders, but the skill tree interface, rather than smacking you in the face and shoving it in the mud like the previous total war game, here it treats you kindly and you know what your looking at. Not only that, but the skill trees (and the tech trees) are done really well, full of detail and surprisingly full of content, with each skill tree becoming different depending on the hero.  Rome 2's dull micromanagement system (and its awful attempt at politics) is all done away with for a much more favoured approach of retaining depth and complexity yet keeping it simple to use.  From the interface to the way everything just feels 'right', TW Warhammer certainly earns its place as the top franchise title. My only regret is that they didn't call it Total Warhammer... *Sigh*   This game also has the most potential of any other previous title, as there is so much they can do to not only improve the game, but also to expand upon it. With two HUGE new standalone (urgh, standalone...) expansions on the way, and dlc (and FLC) on the way for the first title, this is an exciting time to be a Warhammer fan.",1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Warhammer fan? Why are you reading this? Go play the game already.  Is the game good for everyone else? Yes, it's a solid game imho but bear in mind that my opinion is biased since I'm a huge fan of both Total War and Warhammer.   Technical and grapics",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Before anything else, I should say that I have been a total war fan since Shogun I, and I have played every single total war with the exception of Attila.  Total War Warhammer is the most fun I've had playing a total war game, by far. Since release 3 weeks ago, I've put aver 100 hours into the game and have finished the Dwarf, Orc, and Empire campaigns. Before this, I could probably count on one hand the number of times I finished a total war campaign. The factions in previous total war games mostly felt the same, so you would play one or two factions and have a pretty good idea of how the others played. In this game, all factions have totally unique units and play styles.  When I first heard that the game was announced, I was skeptical. I'm a big history nerd, and while I'm a fan of some fantasy I was not really into Warhammer at all. But Creative Assembly proved me wrong. Total War and Warhammer were made for eachother. The fantasy setting makes things seem so much more epic. And the dread and constant warfare of Warhammer is a perfect setting for a Total War game. When I saw my stout little dwarfs go up against barbarous orcs and huge monsters, I felt like there is a much more desperate life or death feel to the combat. Kinda like I'm the Romans holding back barbarians from taking over civilization, except I think being ruled by Huns would be much more preferable then being eaten by an orc. I also love the hero system. You really grow attached to your heroes and your armies, whereas before each general in Total War more or less felt the same. I encountered no technical issues and the game ran surprisingly smooth at launch, unlike alot of other Total War titles. The AI, which is a weak part of almost all Total War games, may be the best that it's ever been.   Now for the cons. Players need to be able to choose where to deploy their reinforcements on the battle map. I had a few battles where my reinforcing army and the enemy reinforcements deployed at the same spot, which led to a huge disorganized battle breaking out on the edge of the map. This turned what should have been an easy victory into a decisive defeat. Also, the AI spends too much emphasis on agent actions, which leads to AI agents that are way too powerful by end game. While the AI agents are way too powerful, the composition of end game AI armies is mostly made up of low quality early game units. The result is that dealing with AI agents is extremely difficult, but player armies become steam rollers by end game.   Anyway, good job Creative Assembly. Rome II and Empire really kind of turned me off from buying Total War games at launch, but you won my confidence back.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"the good +fantasy setting for total war +equal to shogun 2 and with time it might surpass +every update so far has made the game run smoother for me +fractions well done +magic system well put together +monsters (giants, dragons, trolls  the bad -the dlc policy -AI can be very bad -for decent variety of units mod needed radius recomended  -only chaos undivided so far GRAND FATHER NURGLE DEMMANDS RESPECT -NO SKAVEN!!!

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"So far, I really like it. They stripped down the tech and social trees to stream line the battles. There are quests to get geared up and equipable and swappable retainers. The whole thing seems way more like a battle intensive RPG set in the Total War engine, which is why I bought it.   The graphics look great, with diverse little toons amongst the units. They yell, they fight, they die, they get swept through the air and rag dolled by trolls. You can even cast magic and watch them all fry like pork sausages.  The game itself runs good too, I have currently played 3 hours over a remote connection with no issues. There was a point on the very first splash screen where I waited for about 10 minutes before the intro started. I thought it was broken but, it started eventually :/   I don't know if multiplayer is working for anyone else but, it crashed my game the two times I clicked Multiplayer so.... that's definitly a bad mark for the game right now. If you wanted to play this game for the multiplayer, hold off till they fix it. (Fixed now)  Many people have said that it black screens or constantly crashes on them. I haven't experienced that yet, outside of attempting multiplayer. This game runs on my low end bare bones laptop that i'm remoted into from a crapy Dell. I give it two thumbs up for optimization. Now all I want is an Army Painter so the Warhammer Theme would be complete.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"After 133 hours completing legendary greenskin and one week later, im on the verge of breaking up with my 2 girlfriends, losing my job and getting reported for a missing person.  This is my first ever steam game review.  I have been playing total war since shogun 1. i had great time playing rome 1 and shogun 2. im also a huge fan of warhammer since the days of dark omen . i was excited when i got to know about this game just 6 months ago. hated the fact that they had day 1 DLC.   Every time i play a game on launch day, i expect minor hiccups. This game gave me black screen for the opening cinematic because i was using nvidia card, this has been fixed with the game's hotfix and now game runs fine. there were 3 crashes over 133 hours of game play when i tried to swap units between armies. it was annoying. then i realized one crash every two days for a week old game is not a huge issue. at least it was not like rome 2, which was ...well, u know.  What i like about this game is that all the units from different races are not reskins of each other. unlike shogun 2, all the units of different races has their own stats and attributes. i learned this the hard way when my armies which gave me decisive victories towards one race suffered crushing defeats at the hands of another race. - i could not mop the whole map with the same army composition. however, it could be the legendary setting since we suffer a huge penalty and the AI gains huge advantages, even the slightest difference causes major set backs. i was forced to go indepth in understanding each races' units before creating a spesific army for each of them. the economy of races are also done differently, which is a cool thing.  What i didn't like is the multiplayer. it is bare bones. the set up for multiplayer game feels like it is from the 90s. they could learn a lot more from shogun 2 where they had clans, conquest map, smart auto matchmaking and the coolest of all is creating your own avatar and equipping him with gears which drop after a battle is done. each item has it's own stats and completing a particular set would give extra stats. i had expected this from day 1 for warhammer since they had it in shogun 2.  What surprised me is that the AI seems to be quite smart. i had to fight a battle since i got outmanevoured by the AI, AI had a huge army with weak warboss (orc's general), while i had a battered army with experienced warboss. i had thought that i could try to win this battle by killing the AI's warboss with mine and the rest of his army would rout. when the battle started, that warboss did something no greenskin had done - he stayed way back and did not engage me in melee. that cupking coward. my army was wiped out, my warboss dead and his gear looted.   What didn't matter to me is the graphics. im running on a budget card......while the graphics aren't top notch but still it looked good when i zoomed in using the cinematic mode. when you have to fight and command your army on the battlefield, things like units details or grass details becomes negligible. i switched to cinematic mode two times on battles that i knew i would definately win - i wish that i had a high end gpu so i could watch the units in action.  bottomline. this is a fantasy total war. there is no history to follow other than from the lore of warhammer. there is no tetsudo formation and such, however, units with shields automatically raise up their shields under missle fire, this blocks 30% of incoming fire for orcs boyz, while the goblins, having smaller body and could cover their limbs better, could block 50% of missle fires, provided that they are facing the correct direction. i think this automation is convinient and done in part so there would be less micomanagement due to the fact that our attention would be shifted to focus on casting magic and activating magical hero gears. i believe only players who like both total war and warhammer lore would truly enjoy this game.  im not sure if i should make amends with my girlfriends or start a dwarf legendary campaign.",1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: WARHAMMER Reviews before DLC: Very postive.  Total War: WARHAMMER Reviews after DLC: Mixed.  What? I'm shocked! This game is everything that I ever wanted in the Total War Series franchise. The game itself is a great happy marriage between Total War and Warhammer IPs. It is such a shame that people are coming out hating the game based on the fact that it has DLC. In my opinion, the base game is WORTH it for the price it currently is. The DLC is well thought out and created with passion. I'll happily purchase it because the IP is just so great on both sides.  Creative Assembly took the Warhammer Fantasy world and recreated in their vision in such an amazing way. For someone that has been following the Warhammer franchise and own a couple tabletop armies (which sadly I don't play anymore!) I just can not say anything negative to Creative Assembly about this particular title.  I wish MORE people reviewed for the base game opposed to the DLC and expressing their opinion specifically about the game itself. Not pitch forks about 'greedy devs'. Creative Assembly has always shown that they want to satisfy their clients and have always stated that this game would have DLC. Nobody complained about it then, why now?",1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game is amazing. The graphics, sounds, landscapes, armies, and models...all stellar. The reviews are accurate, this is the best Total War game ever and probably the best Warhammer game ever. This and DoW3 will make this an amazing year for Games Workshop themed video games.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I think it is very easy with the Steam review system to recieve an incomplete understanding of how good a game is or isn't. With just a thumbs up or down it is hard for anyone to tell you much about a game. So I would like to break this game down as much as possible to give you are really good source for information.  Firstly lets address the negative reviews that state 'the game is great, I had a lot of fun but **** DLC'. These reviews are not reviewing the game. Ignore them immediatly, there are problems with this game but DLC is an option the problem would only be if the game did not have enough content to begin with.  So lets look at that, what do you get in the base game. The base game gives you 4 races, Empire, Vampire Counts, Dwarfs and Greenskins. The map that you are playing on is set in the Old World of the Warhammer universe. By default all races have 2 legendary lords however through the free updates some have gotten more. Each campaign can take anywhere from 40 to 70 hours to complete. If you consider 1 dollar an hour a pretty good investment this game oozes good value. However if it is **** that would not matter.  Alright so gameplay, this section has to be split into two sections campaign and battle. Starting with campaign this side of the map is a perfect example of 10 steps forward 2 steps back.   Campaign Pros: All cam,paigns FEEL really different Diplomacy is easy to use and understand Stances are all useful and feel intuitive Visuals are beautiful Cities changing to match faction is an amazing addition Economy is limited forcing players to actually make desicions when building armies  Campaign Cons: Regional Occupation (The concept that only certain races can occupy certain cities, terrible idea) Movement in your land is same speed as enemy causing annoying chases through your land Though cities due change when upgraded it is very hard to see the difference unlike Attila or Rome 2  Onto battles, the battles stay mainly the same from previous games with the addition of crazy new units to spice it up. The Ai is also much improved. You can tell a ton of work went into making these great. However the games keep pushing towards smaller maps and faster battles which may have gone a little to far in this one.  Battle Pros: AI (it can actually put up a good fight) Diversity Magic Visuals Custimizable UI (Bound to space bar) Nice additions to control make it easy to move army Impacts are greatly improved  Battle Cons: No blood (Maybe I'm just messed up) Lack of kill animations (understand the point of removing the match combat of older games however a system like Dawn of War where when they go to kill an enemy it plays a combat animation would have been nice) Maps are very small Battles are very short (5 minutes - 8 minutes)  Lastly we need to discuss seiges and the lack of battle diversity in terms of types. Total War Warhammer features two battle types, seige and land battles, no minor settlement battles, no fort battles and no naval battles (not so salty about the last)  Seige Pros: The first few feel epic Art is beautiful  Seige Cons: Single or double wall leaves zero strategy Entire battle is spent watching your troops slowly try to break past theirs Infinite tower range makes artillery useless Only feels like there are 5 different maps Different factions have the same settlements with different art Dwarfs are the most dissapointing as if you want their trailer it shows multi tiered setlements  In conclussion, Total War Warhammer improves on much and gives you a ton of value for the money you are spending, even without mods or DLC. Some of the issues I have mentioned can be fixed with mods. With the game all moded out like mine is the only issue I still see are that seige battles are dull and lack strategy. Other than that this game is amazing and if you love TW like I do this is a breath of fresh air into a very old franchise.",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Great graphics, great performance, playable even on my very old pc at medium, no boring typical TW game, great battles, great strategy, great character lvling, great etc. Simply the best game of many years and will be with its expansions for many more years. I recommend it 100% in all my pro gaming honor. And super fun!!!!!!! Just turn off the antivirus completely when playing this game and it wont lag at all, but turn antivirs off completely and restart the pc if the antivirus needs this to be turned off but remember to turn it on when not playing, i did that and it doesnt lag on medium, it runs great. THIS IS TOTAL WARHAMMER - SPARTA - EPICNESS!!!!!!!!!!!! Also formation abilities are already in the game in passive form for example charge defence vs all etc and this is so well thought cause its no longer a pike wall spam fest for example, also units themselves have active abilities. Also this is IMPORTANT: after making a group for example ctrl+4, then u select that group so all units are selected and press ctrl+G, it saves the unit formation and enables group attack, which is like the a-move in rts, u select when u want the group and click it to attack an enemy unit and the units of the crtl+G group will target different enemy squads which are close to the target, of course the targets arent always the most optimal so u can select those units which dont have the best target and manually set target but this saves a lot of time and like that u dont have to press pause all the time to manually set targets fr each unit of your army. The multiplayer is GREAT - INTELLIGENT - STRATEGIC, plain and simple.",1,1

No more individual units locking into a 'dance' with each other - finally!

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Man are these some troll reviews...  This is the best Total War game ever, warts and all.  I haven't bought the blood DLC, I don't think it's worth 3 bucks. I haven't bought Beastmen either, that sure as hell isn't worth 19.  Would I tank the game reviews with a negative because I'm not happy with them? Hell no, I've already NOT BOUGHT THEM. I speak with my wallet, people who did can speak with their reviews of the actual products they're unhappy with.  This is not a game of copy/paste infantry and cavalry to alter slightly between near identical factions. Some TW games are completely comprised of such near identical factions. Others have two or three significant variations that comprise all or most of their lineups being actually unique from others.  The four base factions are epic, utterly different units from start to finish. Combat is a blast, it would be even without magic and monstrous flyers.  I have plenty of complaints about the game, I think city design has been overly simplified, agent behavior is terrible as usual, and the battlemaps are also hugely simplified, boring affairs compared to what they used to be. The game is still great though, there's no excuse for giving it a negative because you don't like the DLC.  The DLC have their own reviews, use them. This is supposed to be here to help people decide to buy a game by getting relevant, useful information.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"How do I describe it?   It's at the same level Shogun 2 was when it came out. A step up from its predecessors and a step behind what we had hoped for. This game needs to be good and needs to be well received I believe for the Total War franchise to continue on.   PROCONNERUS!   I'm happy the AI doesn't derp it's way into sieges, but the cities are simpler so it feels like a bit of a trade off especially with auto-ladders though its realistically the only solution to the AI's general sad panda face at the prospect of going up walls.    The AI seems to be able to competently handle its new unit types, I was particularly impressed with Chaos's use of Marauder Cav and Tundra wolves for skirmishing. However, the AI also seems to favour the 'If we engaged in a line today, we're certainly going to engage in a line tomorrow!'    There's quite alot of love thats gone into the character models from what I've seen, the art work is certainly on point. Though who ever thought Thorgrims AngryLazyBoyChair3000 was a going solution is a bit well, daft.    I haven't seemed to inherit many of the technical issues people are going on about right now. The con part of it is that theres a huge ♥♥♥♥♥torm over the technical soudness and optimisation of this game. Business as Usual for TW :P  CON-CONNERUS   Dont touch multiplayer in early days right now, its broken af. Though I suspect server load and GLORIOUS COMRADE AUSTRALIAN INTERNET is to blame.     No RPG style Shogun 2 general avatar for multiplayer. Game was basically made for that style of multiplayer and would have shined with it.   All in all, this game is worth the dollars, my hip pocket regret hasn't burned through my trousers so thats a good thing.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Total War: Warhammer is a turn-based strategy game with real-time tactical battles set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles universe.  What is Great about this game:  - The real-time tactical battles are beautiful and terribly satisfying to play while the 'one-more-turn' compulsion of the turn-based strategic game is as strong as in any Total War game in recent memory - Giving the units more active abilities (while slightly micro-heavy) makes the tactical battles much more engrossing and compelling. There is more a sense of you needing to be there to act rather than just watching the armies fight each other - The new customization and upgrade options for your lords and heroes add an almost RPG-like element to the game that is fantastic - Heroes (Agents from previous Total War games) can now integrate into your army and fight as a unit alongside your regular army - The fantasy Warhammer setting allows for the developers to free themselves somewhat from the binds of historical fact - The Steam workshop modding support provides key customization options to make the game play as you want it to without issue - The Warhammer universe is an excellent backdrop for a Total War game, and they come together brilliantly - The game was so impactful on me that I went out and bought my first GW miniature (Mannfred Von Carstein)  What is Good about this game:  - There is a game that the developers could make derived from this game where you build up a party of only (a few) heroes and go through the country-side taking on and defeating standard Total War (20+ unit) armies. I would buy that game and play a lot of that game. That isn't really important to the review of this game except to say that that is how good the new lord and hero RPG elements are - Good use of Steam features including cloud saves, trading cards, etc  What could be improved in this game:  - The new hero and lord abilities - while great - can be a little micro-management heavy as you will spend a significant time in the battles - especially in large battles - just searching for the next hero/lord ability to pop. If a few more of them had been passive abilities - especially for heavy magic users - that probably wouldn't have been a terrible thing - The city management options are quite sparse and relatively uninteresting. Other than a main couple of core provinces that produce units, most of your additional cities will upgrade almost identically - I don't like the mixture of fantasy units and gunpowder units  Conclusion:  At this point, I think that Steam workshop support for Total War games is almost a requirement - not because the games are bad by themselves, but because such effortless modding gives these games entirely new life and the freedom to play them as you wish, so this review takes that reality into account.  I am honestly shocked by so many bad reviews for this game. This is one of the exceedingly rare times when I think the professional reviewers were more accurate than the gaming public. The game isn't perfect by itself, but any modest tweaks to the game can be made via the copious mods available in the workshop, so unless you just can't stand a fantasy setting for a Total War game, this is clearly one of the best playing Total War games in years. Moreover, its innovation in the RPG-like lord and hero skill upgrade paths to me feels like an essential innovation for all future Total War games.  10.0 / 10.0",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"After playing around 120 turns of an Empire campaign and the first 30 of a Greenskins cmapaign i've decided to write this review.  Performance wise the game runs well on medium graphics with some on high and ultra unit size on my NVIDIA GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM, the game looks smooth and has more Shogun II esque graphics than Attila and Rome II. The UI is asthetically pleasing and very intuitive and is very customisable going from quite bare-bones to very informative, allowing you to change it up in-battle. As always the Total War Wiki is there for further information. The Campaign map and it's UI is also intuitive, full of options and necessary information and again, asthetically pleasing.  Moving on to gameplay the fantasy setting brings a new breath of life, increasing replayability and bringing new exciting battle mechanics. Although there are a lack of races to play as (4/5) each faction is VERY different to play as. In this case less is more. The battles themselves are fast-paced, full of actions and awe-inspiring set pieces. There is a lot going on in the battlefield which changes the game up and forces you to bring new tactics to the table. The Campaign itself is very fun and 120 odd turns in is still very exciting and thrilling. The arrival of chaos changes everything where enemies forget their differences and band together to fight the insueing tide of evil. The arrival of chaos does not mean a boring, survive as long as you can but instead brings an exciting new chapter of stemming the stream of the end times.  Overall the game handles the fantasy setting very well, magic is fun and not at all op is feared pre-release and the game is better optimized than Rome II and Attila even for NVIDIA systems. Total War: Warhammer is a match made in heaven and brings a new lease of life to both franchises. This game is a definate for fans of Warhammer, Total War, strategy and fantasy!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I'm just going to say what everyone else is: the game itself is awesome, and the planned expansions will make it one of the best games ever, especially for Warhammer fans. The problem is their DLC policy; it's going to push the total price of the game to ridiculous levels. It's probably best to wait 2 or 3 years when they've released their 2 dozen or more DLC packs and two expansions, and it's all rolled into one neat 'game of the year edition' or whatever they'll call it, and is hopefully far cheaper. If you can't wait that long like I couldn't, try and buy a cheap Steam key from somewhere other than Steam for the base game, and pick just a few of the DLC packs - from the current ones, i'd recommend 'The King and the Warlord' and 'The Grim and the Grave'. You can live without the rest; they can be bought much later on, when they fall in price.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,its good,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,Currently my favourite game. all 4 of the starting campaigns are varied and fun. Have not tried any of the dlc because theres still so much to do with the original game. Highly Recommend.,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"For the first time in a long time the battles actually feel weighted, which is a good thing I am currently playing as the Dwarves and I feel like the Lore has been fleshed out very well, you really feel immersed in the kingdom you are branching out. I do recommend this game for fans of RTS, as well as warhammer fans.  I have not come across any bugs in my very short playthrough so far. My set up is i5 4670k, 16gbs DDR3 ram clocked at 1866, MSI 970 I am getting a steady 55-60 fps 55 when the magic fields are heavy in my regions. I will post a more in depth review after more hours of gameplay.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game is great, even with 'only' 4+1 races is more various than previous Total War and - weird to say - it's really faithful to the Warhammer Universe.  YES, of course has its flaws (IA during siege and more) but i simply don't care. Why? Pros are way more than the cons and - as everyone knows - GamesWorkshop discontinued Warhammer Fantasy for Age of Sigmar.  So this is probably my only opportunity to see a non-amateurish work that deliver the same rich lore that made me fell in love with the Warhammer Universe, in a strategy videogame. The last opportuniy to see the  Tomb Kings  in a videogame. This will be the definitive 'Warhammer compendium' Game, with all the races.   My last goodbye to Warhammer Fantasy.  P.S. ♥♥♥♥ you GamesWorkshop, maybe here you can read me. ♥♥♥♥ you haters too. :D  P.P.S. For any Warhammer fan out there that isn't sure about this game:   We've played March of Chaos. Seriously.  ",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Now I have to admit, i've been a Total War fan since Rome 1, but the last few titles had issues for me.  Not so with Warhammer. Though I find the inability to claim all territories irritating, the fact mods allow me to from day 1 as well as co-op racing with friends is a big plus for me. Gameplay wise, it's a beautiful game. I have to run on low spec due to an older system, but it still looks great. I love the Vampire Counts and, yes, if you build your province right you can field a massive host (I'm about to do battle with 3 terrorgheist!). I had no issue on start up, always a plus there, and the races feel unique which I love.  In short, if your a fan of warhammer hit this up and enjoy the power of magic! (which is amazing to be honest), if not a fantasy fan, at least try it, you may be surprised.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Excellent game which is being continually developed and supported by the devs. There is a major roadmap for future free and paid content. This was one of the smoother Total War launches I have experienced (I could actually play a multiplayer campaign from launch day without constant DC's and crashes).  The DLC can be a little pricey (lots of the negative reviews are salty about this), but there is still plenty of content in the base game (plenty of online replayability) without having to reach for your wallet so you can take it or leave it.  Multiplayer balance is coming along and is in a fairly good place at the moment. They have mainly managed to capture the spirit of Warhammer with a good part of what makes a Total War game and I can only see this game getting better with age.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Short Verdict: Captures the feeling of the Warhammer universe perfectly. Music, art, voice acting, everything. Cavalry and army clashes have more CRUNCH to them than they used to. If you could run Attila and Rome 2, you'll run this even better. Battle AI is better. Campaign play is better because of optimized CPU usage, meaning no more 15 minute turns. Each faction is VERY different, not only in battle but how they play in campaign (i.e. Vampires get to corrupt mortal lands and start up covens to disrupt their public order, Orcs always have to be fighting or your armies kill each other, etc.)  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Long Verdict: Pros -Five (Six in custom battle) Warhammer Fantasy armies, each lovingly detailed with different play mechanics -Great soundtrack -Campaign is extremely accessible, perfect for people who have never played Total War before -Campaign AI is more intelligent, no more of armies running between two points as you ruin their kingdom. They also back off when they see you have a strong defense -Very in depth magic system gives a new layer of strategy to battles -Customizable lords and heroes, choose their equipment and talents  Cons -Environmental destruction and fire effects have been severely downgraded from the spectacle they were in Attila -No unit formations (i.e. wedge formation for cavalry, spear walls, shield walls, etc.) -No more small settlement battles (and therefore no random civilian killing as your army moves in), all sieges happen in large and famous cities -No options to change the season, weather or time of day in battles  Meh -Sieges are relegated to one corner of the city. I'm indifferent to this. -Due to Warhammer lore, diplomacy in campaign is somewhat limited in the kinds of interactions you can have with other factions. I'm indifferent to this. Very lore accurate that Chaos barbarians and Orcs would not come to humans with any sort of trade agreement. -You can't conquer whole map. Only the cities and provinces of your nemesis faction. Again, I don't care about this but perfectionists might. -I do miss the ability to choose ammo types for ranged units. Having one type of ammo for everything simplifies things however, leaving more time to micro for magic.  First time I've finished a Total War campaign in a while. Can't wait until they add the Elf factions to this game.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"So I never bought Attilla, and delayed buying TWW for a LONG time .... because I had my faith seriously tested by TW:R2. This game also appeared so expensive for me, and ofc there is all the DLC issues, which adds up to more than the retail price of the game!!!!  However, now that I have bought it ....  I CAN NOT STOP PLAYING. IT WAS SO WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT ON IT.    The stuff that I thought were going to be issues ARE NOT ISSUES, they MAKE the game!!  Example:  1. You can't paint the entire map! This is so not an issue, it actually works quite well. The sack/raze is GREAT, and makes perfect sense in the game design, and there is so much to do just winning your own campaign and seeing off all the invasions from the areas you cant control. Makes for a great game.  2. The chaos invasions ... these add so much pressure to the game, it creates a driving purpose to be ready for the next wave of invaders. It makes every turn precious!  3. The whole DLC to unlock content thing! I can now see just how much effort has gone into making each faction a completely different play experience. The entire campaign mechanic and storyline and imperative CHANGES with each faction. They have different units, unique technology tree, and totally different playstyle. it is almost like an enirely new game when you switch factions. I cannot wait to get enough of the starting factions, and will definitely be buying the other factions as well. Vampires, Chaos, here I come!!!",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I played Warcraft 2 when it came out on a 56K modem, this is the best Fantasy Battle RTS I've played since. I ♥♥♥♥ing love the Warhammer Fantasy IP and I've played it since the late 80's, this game absolutely nails the feel of waging massive battles with fantastical troops and creatures.  + Gorgeous models + Top notch voice acting, sound effects, and an epic score I hum when not playing + Warhammer to the bone in atmosphere + Endless fun tweaking with army composition and experimenting with different tactics + Free DLC released regularly + Pay DLC unquestionably worth the money  10/10 would raise Altdorf again.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Finally! The Old World comes to fruition. I have read all the Old World novels from the 'Time of Legends' to the Nagash stories, fantastic books and collectors items.  'Come Dawi! For there are grudges to settle!' Love the Dwarves, always have. They have beautifully rendered these stalwart champions. The battle are epic and enormous in scale. Every piece of this game breathes Warhammer.  My only complaint was not adding the Druchii. The Dark Elves are a huge part of the Old World and Malekith is a beast, who needs to be brought into this game. I won't knock a star off for it yet because I'm hoping this will come in DLC.  5 star game, highly recommend to anyone who loves Warhammer, The Old World, and Total War.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,If you're a fan of the fantasy genre and of strategy this is a good game to get into. Enjoying the game myself so far.,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Being really fast in my review, its simply the best total war game ever made!!! :) Each faction plays completely different from the others and the game is way more straightforward than every other total war game to date.   It have a bit of a shogun feel to it and the AI can give you a run for your money even in normal difficulty. I super recomend it for every fan of TOTAL WAR tittles or anyone that likes a good WHAAAAAAAG!!!!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Definitely the most polished total war release to date, a solid 9/10 at release.   Pros:  - All the races have extremely different rosters and play styles that keep you interested in the game for much longer than a normal total war title (I usually find different nations have rosters that are very similar in normal total war games). - The lore is interesting and at times funny - Battles are flawless and the flying units are pretty cool.  Cons: I feel like the Chaos hordes arrive too quickly in the campaign, maybe if they came in at around turn 100 it'd be better.  All in all i'm looking forward to expansions of this game, should be interesting.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"   FANBOY ALERT    I have played every total war game uptill now and can safely proclaim that this is the best TW so far ... even surpases loved and praised Shogun 2. This is it! The series mechanics works with Warhammer world just great, graphic and animations are beatiful (and well optimized), battles are large and immersive, game is true to the lore, every race plays differently, voice acting and in-game movies are top quality. First of TW's that don't require any mod to play game to full potentional and likeness.  ++ Warhammer (let me be the heretic and say that fantasy works just better) + Graphic and animations, optimized experience even on mediocre hardware + Gameplay and inovations (for example fly units) + Playable races (don't really enjoy the chaos but that's my personal aversion to horde) + Magic and rune system + Bugs free + I am one lucky guy, apparently no crashes or problems with singleplayer/multiplayer after Day One patch - no elves, hope for DLC/FLC  10/10  'Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh' ",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is my favorite Total War game to date. I am relatively new to the franchine however. I started with Shogun 2 but did not really get into the game untill Rome 2.   I think the the Warhammer fantasy setting is a perfect fit for Total War. Each of the factions feels unique unlike most of the previous Total War games, making it a joy to play all of them. It also makes diplomacy more interesting because instead of just dealing with a lot of humans you get to deal with fantastical creatures.   The hero units are great too. They feel more impactful compared to previous generals in Total War. Upgrading them with new skills and giving them new weapons feels more satisfying when you see them in action.  The game is not perfect though. It lacks mouth movement during diplomacy, and many factions do not even have voice lines for trade. All of the empire factions look the same, except for their troosp are a different color pallet. All of their leaders use the same two or three models however so they don't feel distinct.   Overall I would highly reccomend this game.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've been playing TW since the first shogun, and after getting burned by Rome 2 I was pretty skeptical, but the game's solid.   Pros: - Great job on optimization, at least compared to previous games - Battles are the best they've ever been - New elements like magic and monstrous creatures add a great level of depth to combat - Very well polished and atmospheric - Voice acting, music, and general sound is all great - AI all around - though not perfect and prone to hiccups here and there - is certainly very much improved - Campaign map is less tedious, additions like quests add immersion and things to do besides blobbing - Global recruitment   Cons: - Agents can get a little frustrating with how weak they are against other agents. Even with Witch hunters with level 3 assassination or whatever it's called will take like 5 or 6 tries and 3,000 gold later to actually wound some ♥♥♥♥ sorcerer who's the same level as him.  - Quests tend to pull you all over the map, so while they're really cool and a great feature they can get a bit frustrating at times. For example, part of a quest demanded that I ally with Nordland - but despite fighting all their same enemies, being friends of their friends, and showering them with gifts, it took an extremely long time for them to accept anything. I had the next part of the quest - acquire a Rocket Battery - done well before it.  - No Navies  Your mileage may vary: - General system still in place. Whilst global recruitment addresses this, it feels more like a bandaid than a feature. Maybe it's for the AI to prevent tiny stacks everywhere, but I greatly preferred being able to freely move units wherever I wish. I've been told the reason is to focus on smaller, bigger battles but in my experience it just makes every battle the same 20v20 or 20v8. A better option I think would be to allow more units in a single stack and re-introduce the interception mechanic from Empire. But hey, I'm not a programmer so if it's better this way then so be it.  - Campaign map though less tedious is becoming more and more simplified. I'm not crying over sanitation and food, but I do miss the long extensive building chains in previous total wars (even just things like upgrading roads, it was cool seeing the province develop and looking at actual ships and wagons traveling between towns)  As a side note I do have to give praise to CA or Sega or whoever has been in charge of marketing it. It was very transparent with live gameplay being easily available to watch (though I don't know why a bunch of random youtube streamers who don't play total war were given copies, I'd much rather just watch the CA group or actual TW streamers play). It was also a good show of faith to move chaos from pre-order to 1st week free. Whilst I despise early DLC stuff, it was still a nice gesture and shows they listen to the community.   All in all a great game, definitely recommend.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Genre - Turn Based Fantasy Strategy  I was a massive Warhammer fan back in the mid 90s but haven't been able to get into the tabletop significantly since. I played Shogun Total War a lot back in the day but haven't got into any Total War games until this one.  I got this game on pre-order with the free Chaos expansion. I played through the Dwarf campaign on easy and no mods, managing to earn a win after a lengthy session. Then I tried the Chaos and Beastmen achieving campaign wins with both and having fun on the way. I only fought the odd battle auto resolving most due to the limited time I have to play games nowadays (I miss being a student so much).  Since then I have tried running unsuccessful campaigns as the Empire and Vampire Counts due to what I think was an OP Chaos invasion with powerful armies and the norse types becoming automatic vassals attacking from all sides that was restricting my ability to capture enough cities for a win. This I admit led to a few rage quits.  I have since experimented with mods and found one that disables the chaos invasion. Now I have played through with all three other races and had a great time dominating the map.  I have also tried a few co-op campaigns, these have been fun and although the objectives are basic you get to try out some interesting alliances. The main problem I have here is coinciding the time to play.  The various races have there own unique objectives and through the free and paid DLC you can get more races, factions and units. These can be used in all your Grand Campaign games to add more variety. I know some people don't like paid DLC but with each one I have got so far (exc. the blood pack) I have felt they are value for money and give significant added enjoyment to the game. There are loads of free community mods that allow you play the game the way that you want, without paying extra money too.  I think it is just a shame that it feels the main story of the campaign of the Chaos Invasion was not thoroughly play tested for balance across all the races. Without it you are able to have some great sandbox Warhammer themed fun though.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"When I first bought the game I was very skeptical because of the negative reviews. However, after installing and playing it. I must say it is Total Wars master piece thus far. It is beautiful and runs smoothly for me. I had no issues at the start up screen that so many were complaining about. The diversity among the factions is a nice change, and the required play style is different for each one as well. Well done CA, thank you for a well made game!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Alright, there's alot of mixed and negative reviews on here. So, I figured I'd go in and throw my hat for a positive review. Alot of the negative reviews are recent, and are based on the Call of the Beastmen DLC (Or, if you want to be less fancy, Beastmen Race pack). Furthermore, alot of them are critiquing a combination of things regarding that DLC, and are pasting it on the main page.  Well, 20 bucks per race pack, if that's CA's plan, is extreme. I'll grant them that. And that's a discomfort, but, here's something I couldn't find anybody mentioning when I was skimming through the negative critiques....the Beastmen are freely showing up in the campaign as an AI race. You only have to kick in if you want to play as them. Not against. I feel if the DLC mentioned that it might help it retain some gravitas or resemblance of sanity in this comment section, as I milled through it when it was in preorder and bought a copy of it for myself. Kicking myself for that a bit now, as I didn't actually want to play the buggers, I just wanted an extra threat to show up for later in the game.  But, I digress. What's good/bad about this game?  Good: Pretty lore accurate (As far as I can tell) depictions of most of the beasties and monsters in this game from this setting. AI can now use cavalry/light speedy assault units to actually go after squishies. Grand Campaign is a managable conquer simulator, which the modders in the workshop have enhanced to allow you to make it an unmanagable, insane, inventory filling abomination just like the old grand campaigns. The combat's got alot of interesting questions to learn the answers to (Q: Can Graveguard fight a giant A: Maybe?) Each race plays differently from each other race in noticable ways. (Beastmen have a pressure to always attack, yes, I did try out the 20 buck investmen. Greenskins can't really stop rebellions, but don't really want to, as it creates sweet free Waaagh stacks. Vampire Counts want to slowly invade the rest of the world, corroding the morales of others into welcoming their new vampiric overlords. Imperials and Dorfs play more or less like old Total War, with Imperials having a special promotion system as their unique mechanic, and Dwarfs gaining quests for allies being harassed, or themselves losing ground/fights). In battle, it's a fantasy RTS, out of battle, it's a fantasy turn based kinda grand-strategy-mabob (With the grand strategy really devolving into who's your friend vs who's your enemy/which direction you're going to war in next. If they call Stellaris grand strategy, this is really more of the same in that respect) Both of which aren't exactly the most 'populated' genres independently, and getting both together is a bit light. And, ultimately, the model designs are beautifully well crafted, with the workshop letting you pimp them if you feel they're not quite glorious enough, I'm sure someone has had the same idea you've had.  Alright, let's go to the bad.  Well, everyone's ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the price point, but honestly, alot of games release with less features then this one does, and offer the new features as mono-DLC. This -doesn't- offer the new features exclusively as DLC, again, people who kick in 60 get the same experience (outside of what forces chaos can field and what races they can play personally) as people who've got all the DLC. What it does do that personally kind of offends me is offer the new features without a great deal of bug testing. I think the reason for this on the beastmen DLC was that they wanted to keep this game on people's radars and shelves, but still....I mean, if they'd waited a few more weeks, maybe they could've stopped their entire bug page on their forum from being repeats of 'Beastmen buggy', a few of which I've experienced personally.  The game could use a pruning on bugs. Seriously, the game's got quite a few problems still, which is surprising, because most of these I wouldn't have expected given this is sharing an engine with Total War Rome 2. I'm -fine- with them, because alot of these bugs aren't game breaking, but if you were to jump back just a week, a week and a half, the game would occasionally have enemy armies be invisible until they were 50 meters out. Which is crippling for any artillery players (Although not so much for chaos, yes, yes, I preordered the game, or vampire counts, my two main races).   The game tends to not have enough diversity in the late game. Frankly, if you kill a race off, it's gone, and currently, there's not really much possibility of anything showing up, resulting in Imperials needing to erase the AI vampire counts (And since AI doesn't know how to play vampire counts, that's a pretty easy task) and the incoming chaos hordes, and then they can kinda just...sit there and resettle until they win. Meanwhile, dwarfs...once the greenskins are gone, there's pretty much nothing for them to do but slowly confederate all the other dwarfs into their massive dwarf empire. I was hoping beastmen would shake this up, but...honestly, they have a pretty nasty tendency of dying really early in the campaign currently. I don't know why.  The AI doesn't like using higher tier units. I was really patient on a vampire counts Hard game. I didn't kill the actual human empire for a hundred and fifty turns. Their one high tier unit in their army was two squads of demigryph knights. That was it. I had half a dozen terrogheists split across 6 armies, and the Empire had two squads of demigryph knights. If the game was actually simulating the AI's path, I'd be fine with this, but the AI has infinite money to do what it needs to do, and it has heroes that level every turn, could we get some, and I hate to say this, just a little bit of cheating to make the AI match its' lands? Maybe Nuln has a tendency to have riflemen or a steam tank sitting waiting after the first 20-30 turns, for example. As-is, chances are, you're only seeing the cool ♥♥♥♥ -you- can do, and it's never really highlighting the other races as well as it could, outside of quick battle, where the AI kinda just grabs one of everything.  And, as many, many people have put, they don't release full races. Which is...discomforting. Because beastmen are missing three units, Chaos Warriors can't tap into the power of the dark gods individually (Outside of the campaign map, and even on the campaign map....it's kinda...lackluster and random whether the gods let you reach for them at all.) Chaos Warriors are a great 'I want to be a dark magic barbarian' simulator, not really all that good for the 'chaos' part of it though. Vampire Counts don't have everything for them yet (They're missing Strigoi ghoul kings and two engines), Imperials don't have all their mages, blah blah blah.   Would I reccomend this game? Absolutely. The TL:DR of the above is that this game's fun. If you don't have the money to buy a race you want, then, seriously, just wait for a sale for the thing to go down to 5 bucks. DLC always gets hit the hardest in sales.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"  The End Times have arrived.   Chaos fanatics and abominations led by Archaon the Everchosen, the Three-Eyed King and favored son of Chaos, march ever-forward from the desolate North with a single goal set before them, to bring forth the end of the world in honor of the dark gods.  Entire nations of men have fallen, Orks have been wiped out from the world, and the only thing standing against the tides of darkness is an uneasy alliance between the mountain Dwarfs and the undead legions of Sylvania... or at least it would be if the damnable Dwarfs didn't decide this was prime time to exact revenge for a trade dispute that occurred ages ago!    As I sat there watching my entire empire crumble I was left wondering if I should be angry the AI decided to essentially throw the entire campaign and condemn us all to eternal damnation, or genuinely impressed it managed to do exactly what the Dwarfs in Warhammer lore would do - seek revenge against anyone foolish enough to end up in their great Book of Grudges.    The Factions",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,[still playing and testing the game]  Total War: Warhammer is a nice alternative to Total War: Atilla and Total War: Rome II. Total War: Warhammer is all in one not a improvement over the other Total War games but it offers a new experience of Total War.  Pro + Graphic + Realistic + Better AI than Total War: Atilla and Total War: Rome II + Most important Mods are already available  - Performance is struggling sometimes. - Standard Camera is somehow broken? - Formations of some Units are missing - No Seafight  / Only 5 Races BUT they are completely different / Camera can be fixed with mods  I am actually enjoying this game.. even without having time for it because of my study.  Overall 8/10,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"THE game, along with my disappointment over the current console generation, that inspired me to upgrade from my old A6 powered laptop and build my first gaming PC. My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.   Total War is up there as one of my favorite game series, Warhammer + 40k are my favorite fictional universes. Thankfully, CA have done a good job of bringing the two together and continue to improve on the base game with some decent DLC (except the blood/gore one, this really should have been part of the base game + Beastmen is overpriced).   While the game has its issues (legendary lords are way too OP (even given the source material), AI is missile unit heavy, many overworld and diplomacy exploits...); it runs great, can be really challenging (I now save scum on EVERY turn + before EVERY battle) and is just a fun nerdy time sink.   Total War + Warhammer = Total War: Warhammer - does exactly what is says on the tin.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"  I love this game. Honestly, I do.  Pro's: - Combines Warhammer and Total War in a great way - A lot of content - Most unique Total War game to date - Very unique races, units, lords and heroes - Graphics, Voice-acting, music and sound is amazing - Magic is a great addition, just like the various new unit types. - Reimplements good features from older games like Provinces. - Character Customization is very cool - Improved AI, both in battles and the campaign - Great support from the developer  Cons - Rare crashes/performance issues - Long loading times - The AI has been improved, but it's still lacking - Magic seems a little unbalanced. 'Attack' spells are quite weak compared to the buffs. - AI Heroes can be very annoying on the campaign map - Lacking multiplayer  Most cons are details, while the pro's are big and very welcome. I would rate the game 8/10. Recommended! ",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Despite a lack of game complexity and 'dumbed down' features from previous Total War titles, I was excited to experience the lore and battles of the Warhammer series from a more visual and immersive medium. There is a lot of potential for the game to be expanded upon, especially with proper support for the modding community. It will be interesting to see what's introduced as DLC, as the game makes you want more.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER, If you think I missed something in my review feel free to tell me      THE TIME HAS COME FOR WAR!!,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This is a really refreshing game as far as the Total War series is concerned! I was initially concerned by them going in the Warhammer direction, but my fears no longer exist.   It is such a nice feeling to send your hero unit into battle and watch the mayhem he creates. It reminds me a little bit of Sauron just destroying units, except it's not Sauron but Karl Franz!  They improved a lot as far as cavalry is concerned, too. It used to always be a little disappointing to me in previous games when a cavalry charge would just fail because the enemy turned his units just on time. Now Cav has weight, and units WILL go flying even when prepared. Also no more of that 'if one unit is engaged the whole cavalry stops and turns back' BS.  Spells are fun to use as well. Seriously powerful, but not completely OP.  The campaign is actually really intelligently done, too. When I first heard that say the Empire could only take occupy other human settlements and Vampire Count settlements, I was a little concerned. But it turns out it is really a smart move because now every campaign will automatically feel different, since you will be settling in different regions completely-ish.  I had stopped enjoying Total War games since Shogun 2. However, I can now finally say that this is no longer the case. Bottom line, this game is great, and I highly recommend it! Oh and you don't need to be a big Warhammer fan to enjoy the game. I barely know anything about it, yet I am having a blast! I am sure it helps, but I don't think you will miss serious story-altering facts (yes, I realize Warhammer fans now think I'm a giant moron... I'm okay with that).",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"One of the best Total War releases so far. Every faction is unique and plays differently, giving you a huge amount of replayability. Total War : WARHAMMER is a game every Warhammer fan and even every Total War/ RTS fan should pick up !",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I've been a long time fan of the TW franchise, but wasn't enthused about Rome2, and I didn'tplay Attila. However, TW:W had made an incredible leap forward with it's engine, story telling, and presentation.   I love the difference between the races. Till now, factions were pretty much texture swaps with a few units getting bonuses and possibly a limited amount of unique units (that looked a lot like other units). Now we have different models, different animations, different army structures, different economies, different play styles. Completely unique units, the addition of spells and flying creatures shake up how we used to think about fighting in this game.   There's lots of game play additons here as well. AI that will actually keep their word and have different temperments. Massive amounts of personalization for your characters- abilies, equipment, and followers; you can change your equipments around and gift it to other heros or generals. Heros can now take part in battles. The leveling system is a lot more incrimental giving you more choices. Your main faction leader has individual quests that unlock incredible items.   CA also did a great job of sticking to the Games Workshop IP of the old world. It 'feels' like Warhammer.   Over all huge thumbs up. More to do, more (and different) ways to do it, and a metric ton of replayability.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,This is decent game and in my opinion is better than its predecessors. The factions are well balanced and the new Hero and Wizard units make a great addition to the game.   With that said there are a few bugs at the moment that let it down.   1) I am unable to play multiplayer due to the game crashing as soon as I select it. 2) The game sometimes crashes on the start screen. 3) Ridiculous waiting time for the game to strart (when it does not crash)   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *Edit* All bugs have been fixed.,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"A great game that runs so much better than any of the recent Total War games. It still has some of the issues of Total War AI, but all in all the battles are a ton of fun. Probably gonna easily sink a couple hundred hours into this game.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I love this game, the more content the better in my eyes. I love the lore, and gameplay.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,I've already had some of my favourite moments ever in a Total War game. It has problems but I haven't enjoyed playing a game as much as this since Medieval II.,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Definitely the best modern Total War since Shogun II. The factions play very differently from one another, but are also reasonably well balanced. Any issues you have with the open-endedness of the campaign can be fixed via day one mods.   Easily the least buggy release by CA in a long time.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"  To preface this for transparency reasons, I've been given a press copy of Total War: Warhammer.  Total War: Warhammer has turned out to be a pretty spectacular game and will form a strong basis for future content expansions.   I've been a huge Warhammer Fantasy fan for over ten years. I've played Call of Warhammer for Medieval II and Mark of Chaos for PC. It's been awesome to see Creative Assembly provide a really quality game.  PROS: 1.) It feels very well optimized and the turns end quickly. 2.) The factions are defined and unique. There isn't a copy/paste feeling that  3.) The magic is varied and while it needs rebalancing for offensive magic, is a welcome addition. 4.) The aesthetic of the towns and campaign map is amazing. This is the new standard for future Total War titles. 5.) The AI feels more competent and logical. They attack when it's advantageous, they may broker for treaties and so forth.  CONS: 1.) There's still a need for an arcade option like in Rome I. The battles are very fast and almost overwhelming, especially with the addition of a new micro-management option (magic).  2.) I don't know yet how this is late game. But right now units will break and come back quite often. This makes the pacing of the battles feel frantic. The balance needs looking into for a more cohesive experience. I want to be able to watch the battles from time to time or have formations retained. 3.) I really did hope for a form of tabletop painter for units. I've always wanted customization in the vein of the Avatar mode in Shogun 2. The idea of changing their appearance and colors is pretty intrinsic to a Warhammer experience.  For my own personal score, I give it a 8/10.",1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Got home today and waited for the upload of the hotfix. Once done I embraced my darker side and started a Vampire counts campaign.  19 turns in and all but shcwartzhafen is under my sway with a solid foundation of cities in Eastern Sylvania.  Mannfred has immersed himself in the Lore of Death, and has acquired the Sword of Unholy Power from it's resting place.  Now let the feeble minded cattle of Stirland quake, for the Dark counts of Sylvania ride again.  10/10   Update 14/6/16  During the 3 weeks or so that I have had the game I have now had the opportunity to play all the races in campaign.  Vampires - quite hard to build outwards due to vampiric corruption, but a good challenge. Stirland is under my sway and now I consolidate waiting for the next moment to strike.  Dwarfs - rather easy campaign on normal. with the help of the humans numbers was able to crush chaos after obliterating the orcish tribes south of blackfire pass and all through the World's Edge mountains. Karak Ankor lives again.  Empire - Still playing through as Karl Franz. Both the Empire and Dwarfs find it easier to expand due to confedeartion mechanics. Archaon has been sent packing once and has returned. Once Karl wields Ghal Maraz I shall march north and destroy the chaos threat once and for all.  Orcs - Waagh Azhag is progressing nicely, however it can be difficult to maintain momentum North. However Karaz-a-Karak lays within my hands and the Dwarf empire is in even more tatters than before. Throgrim has been sent packing and only now rears his face.  The crown whispers to me, and I shall obey.  Out of charcter -   11/10 review. Love the game, enjoy the tactical side and building settlements. I will try it on hard next time and see if I can truly challenge myself.  Only gripe - quest battles. Hard to get through all the item battles before the end of the game as they're always further and further away.  But that one gripe is not enough to spoil the game in any way.  Love it Love it Love it!  If you liked Warhammer in the last 30 years - buy this game.    Update 26/07/16   Keeping this review updated as I feel it helps others.  As of now, I have completed the Empire, Dwarf and VC campaigns.  Of all of them, the VC campaign I feel I played the slowest, but finally managed to wipe the Empire from the map, whilst contending with the Chaos threat.  The corruption mechanic does make the game more difficult for the VC, especially in the early phases. I also made a mistake going round the south part of the map, eliminating the Border Princes before wiping out Estalia, Tilea and Bretonnia with Mannfred leading the charge.  Just Chaos to complete, a far different proposition but a challenging one.  On the DLC, I feel that it is worth it, I will be pre-purchasing soon, but before I will be revisiting the Dwarfs to try and improve my last performance (it was my first campaign) in terms of speed, before diving into the Beastmen next week.  All I can continue to say is how great this game is and how much fun it is to play, and the DLC seems to be a continuous stream of new content.  Still 11/10 and a brilliant investment. If you wait for a sale in December, I'd go as far as 15/10 because you will get it at a steal, but I know I wouldn't be able to wait that long!",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"This game combines all that one loved of the total war franchise, adds in all the best bits of the warhammer franchise..and combines them perfectly.  Miss the old days of total war medieval but always wanted fantasy and magic added in? Then this is your game!  Love the warhammer lore and all that but hate the price or model gaming? Then this is your game!  Of course in current total war greedyness outside of the core game there is and will be to come, a lot of DLC. You should know this by now going into a total war game. This does not ruin or end the game for me personally as the core one has more than enough for the price in my opinion. IT also lets me pick and choose what factions I may want in the future, what stories, etc. (Bring on the skaven!!!!)   ",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Amazing game. I'm playing on a low tier PC and I give this game a 8.5/10 I'm sure once I upgrade it will be a lot better. I've been playing for about 7 hours now with no issues. This game runs better than Attila. If you love Warhammer and Total war get this game right now!  The good:  1: Easy to pick up gameplay if you're new to any Total war game 2: Graphics are good (if you're used to COD like graphics this game is not for you) 3: Optimized very well I'm getting 40+ fps on a below Min requirement PC  4: 130 turns in with the Empire and it's still not stale. 5: Quest battles are fun and give good rewards that help you on the campaign map, I'm sure modders,DLC and FLC will add more 6: Combat is a bit slower than Attila 7 : Flying units  The Bad:  1: If you want to run this game on max settings you'll need a decent computer 2: Lack of factions 3: Magic is a bit hard to get used to  The Ugly 1: The game still needs a bit of polish in terms of hotfixes but I've been playing for 130 turns and have not run into anything game breaking.   Update. Most of the negative reviews are not legit, If I can play on my potato of a computer you'll be fine. I've played every Total war since Shogun and this game feels like TW is going back to it's roots with a fantasy story. Also if you notice the negative reviews are from people playing less than a hour.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Not really sure what all the fuss about the black screen bug when you launch the game, it was a simple fix, check your firewall settings, verify cache or launch in offline, ( I got the game on release and that happened, I just had top launch in offline)  That's what 90% of the downvotes are.",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"An awesome Warhammer game and the best Total War game that revolutionized the saga. It delivered practically everything I had hoped for.   Small negatives: - After a while real-time combat becomes redundant - Diplomacy system still could be more usefull and needs refinement. While your AI allies drag you into too many, useless wars too quickly - Some DLCs are a bit overprized",1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Despite all of the issues surronding DLC pricing for the game, TW:W is arguably the strongest in the series. I only envision the game improving upon itself as time goes on, and CA, despite still causing controversey with their pre-order bonuses, DLC pricing, etc... HAVE improved marginally compared to the past releases of Rome 2 and Attila. I strongly suggest a purchase if the Total War series interests you, or even just the Warhammer property. If nothing else, this game is poised to take the place of the now defunct Fantasy Battle property and it won't quite cost a liver to pay for!",1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"This game and No Man's Sky taught me a few things about gaming. Lessons you'd think I would have learned long ago, but haven't.  First, never buy a season pass from a mega-publisher that has no reason to earn it, I.E. Ubisoft, EA, Activision. Since they are already established with a rabid non-discriminating fanbase, they have no reason to go beyond minimal expectations; They already have all of our money, so why would they? Do buy a season pass from CD Projekt Red.  Second, never pre-order anything. Ideas are a dime a dozen. A lot of games look fantastic 'on paper', but can fall to ♥♥♥♥ if not implemented and executed properly. This is one of those games.  I have very few regrets in life. Maybe two. Not kissing this one girl I could've, and not finishing something I started. Putting 300 hours into this game is my third regret.  As someone who played from release, lived through the severe crafting nerfs, exploits, pvp zone (DZ) hackers, scarcity of loot, horrible RNG of loot, I implore you to learn from my mistake and walk, nay, run away. Massive, the developer, has no idea what they are doing. Allow me to clarify.  Massive, as a small, fledgling developer, was given a project that was too big for their breeches. Do they have fantastic artists and modelers? Yes. Did they nail New York City? As a native New Yorker born and raised, yes. Did they make a fun cover based shooter? Only in part.  After hitting level 30, the game flips on its head. Enemies become too strong, requiring too many bullets to kill. The cover based mechanics you relied on to get you that far are subverted by rushing enemies with millions of HP. Which would all be well and good if loot fell from the skies, a la the latest iteration of Diablo 3 (not Diablo 3 from release, again, another lesson in early adoption). But it doesn't. You kill droves upon droves of enemies, for one chance at one piece of loot that might be the right level with maybe one good stat out of four. Any time the community figured out a way to obtain gear more quickly, Massive 'fixed' it (read: slowed it down again). For some reason, Massive is catering to an extreme niche of gamers that enjoy ultra slow and painful progression, like EverQuest players that insist that if you make a game hard enough, slow enough, and painful enough to play, you can relive the glory days of one of the first MMOs. You can't. Those days are gone.  Does Massive know how to make a game? Yes! Do they know how to make a game fun? No. Massive believes in scarcity and 'programs' from a perspective of scarcity. They want your loot journey to be long, painful, and drawn out. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. They don't want to make your time in the Division more bountiful. They don't want you to ever gain the satisfaction of 'completing' a character. And I use the word 'programs' loosely.  If you're at all interested in game development, you'll get a kick out of all the terrible mistakes they made with the Division. From horrible netcode, to client side tracking of player stats (ammo was stored locally, so you could just edit your own files for infinite ammo), to hard coded event dates (in a nut shell, rather than using 'make event every X days' they used 'make event on May 8th, 15th, 22nd...' so that when the scheduled dates run out, then you run out of events, which actually happened in game, twice).  As for the Season Pass, players got one extra room. Seriously, it's a mission, in a room. And then we got procedurally generated sewer tunnels. Basically the same brick and sewer textures over and over again. That's all. For the price of 2/3's of the base game: One room, and random sewers. Granted, we're only halfway through the season pass, but that's still not worth the price.  As an aside, I have kept up with Massive's 'State of the Game' streams, and am aware of the work they are doing on their next big patch, 1.4. Even with the 'community involvement', gear balancing, and loot changes, it still doesn't change the broken gameplay loop.  Let's be honest, this was supposed to be as much a loot hunt game as it was a shooter (even if you prefer to focus on the shooting element, you wouldn't be able to overstate the importance of gear). In a nutshell: you shoot things, get or craft new loot, shoot more things. The game breaks at the 'get or craft new loot' stage.  Massive's idea of a loot drop game is a slowly dripping faucet, and 1.4 seeks to increase that drip slightly. By comparison, Diablo 3 at release was a dripping faucet that was later turned into a flooding fountain. Fundamentally, it's about game design: drop more loot to keep players happy and playing longer, or drop less loot to keep players unhappy and playing longer.   At release, Massive's choice wasn't clear. I played, hoping it would get better. I wanted to experience the end game before judging it. I wanted to see which direction future patches would take the game. Not only did it not get better, but it got severly worse. As one example, they increased the crafting requirements by 1500% overnight.  In short, you're overpaying for a good introductory experience that opens up to the most painfully slow and boring progression imaginable.   *UPDATE* : I wanted to wait before updating my review until I had more time to thoroughly test all of the QOL changes Massive has made with 1.4 (and now 1.5) , but some people can't wait. So I will sacrifice thoroughness for promptness.  With only 10 hours in 1.4/5, in spite of all of the changes Massive has made, my impression of the game has remained wholly unchanged. That is not to say that they haven't tried to fix these issues, because they have and in some regards they have been successful.  First, the open world past 30 has a purpose now. All mobs, however small, have a chance to drop loot whether you're in an incursion, a hard/challenging mode mission, dark zone (pvp area), or the open world. This was a very necessary step in the right direction. Likewise, there are multiple ways to acquire loot, though each method feels a bit more convoluted than the next. You can gather intel to hunt daily and weekly high value targets, kill bosses that spawn every four hours, farm missions as usual, run the incursions (I advise only as a group), survive the underground, last in survival mode.  So the options are there, and supposedly no one method is necessarily better than the other. Having been on hiatus for so long, I can't tell you if I was playing as efficiently as possible, though I wish I knew. Knowing Massive and their tendency to want to push the entire player base in a particular direction (up until 1.4, there was only one place to get useful gear and it would shift as they updated their content). But at this point, I don't care. There are so many rankings and resources and modes to keep track of that I'm not going to put the effort into figuring it out.   Really, the only way to play The Division now is with friends. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but one I can't abide. I've put in my WOW time already and don't plan on adopting that kind of raiding lifestyle again. Is that necessary for the Division? No, you can use pick up groups for a lot of content. But for the best gear, you will need a highly coordinated group. Not that there is anything fundamentally wrong with that; it's just not right for me anymore.  So, they've improved the loot situation, but I still don't find the end game enjoyable. Enemies still don't scale well. They still have perfect aim. You will still get grenade-spammed by the NFL's best quarterbacks (seriously, their aim is stupendous). And I don't enjoy tweaking their cryptic stat system to figure out if % elite damage is more useful than % headshot damage, or if it's even working as intended (reduced damage taken used to increase damage taken, for example). Likewise 1.5 has had tech problems.    Bottom line  Good budget game. No longer fun for me.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"When The Division was teased for people to get them hyped, the game looked amazing. They promised so much and gave a hell of a show when promoting the game. So we waited. We sat on our hands in order to keep from clapping at the idea of being able to roam around in a world so vast and changing, acquiring loot, meeting friends, and forming expansive teams along the way. The game looked awesome and boasted a lot of things to occupy your time. Then....it released.   Graphics were dumbed down. Gameplay was repetitive. There was no guild/clan features. Matchmaking was buggy. Weapon and Gear bonuses and stats were incorrect. The plot of this game shifted from fighting in an environment that was devastated by a virus to more of a giant bug collection where you fumbled and crawled your way through all the pain brought on by the issues in the game just to experience what it was like to level up. And Ubisoft/Massive did little to help. Even now, after rolling out patch 1.2, they have broken more than they fixed. In fact we're all sure that they fixed nothing and uploaded a compiled file of bugs into the game instead. So let's list what we have here. Please read this carefully before you ever consider purchasing....or even playing for free.   Pros ::  - The Game looks gorgeous - The equipment system is lovely - The personal appearance is pretty entertaining - Static clutter and objects are plenty and not stationary. (Shoot that rat. Smack that lamp) - The sounds are great. The ambience is just intense with headphones, which is good. - There are plenty of missions to choose from for the first 30 hours - The weapon modification system is nice  - The gunplay is pretty decent  Cons :: (Hold on to your hat) - There are bugs. Bugs everywhere. I mean seriously, this game is made of bugs. - There is no customer service - Patches break a LOT more than they fix - Gameplay is VERY repetitive - NPCs can shoot through walls - Players get locked out of instances - Upon joining a match, there is a high chance you will fall through the map, get teleported out, and fall again. - Graphical bugs left and right. You'll see the poly blocks floating around where fog should be, etc.  - The storyline is extremely boring - The game is nothing like the trailers. It has been dumbed down - The content you see from the E3 promotions? Totally inaccurate - The NPCs are all pretty much the same, only some have flamethrowers and some have armor.  - The loading screens are EXCESSIVE. Every single thing you do prompts a loading screen. If you join a group from matchmaking, you load for 2 minutes. They can kick you during that 2 minutes. So your load screen resets before you even load in and, what, you're dropped where they SHOULD have been. Then it teleports you back to a safehouse and you load for another 2 minutes. Even for High end PCs, the load times are far too long and there is a sickening amount of things that call for them. - The Matchmaking, frankly, sucks. It will not match you with people within the range of your gear. So if you're trying to gear up, it just tosses you in an open slot. And if that group is geared and they don't like that you're not, you get booted. This makes joining groups for getting into the DZ and missions in order to even get gear HARD. Of course, you get kicked and get to see those neat load screens. - The latency is iffy. I personally run on a fiber connection and the amount of lag that I see is ridiculous. You'll watch people scoot down walls. You'll see yourself teleport several feet from where you took cover. You'll unload 4 complete magazines into an enemy and do no damage only to see the damage pop up on him 20 seconds later after he's killed your teammate. Etc. - The cover system is ALMOST acceptable, but it's not. Having your cover system default to the same button as your roll button is just bad. You'll try to move into cover and roll right past it. Or attept to roll away from a grenade damage zone and take cover instead thus killing you. - A lot of the NPCs are overpowered. This game is punishment if you have to fight a group of NPCs that have shotguns. Not only can they 1 shot you, but they have armor. And they don't take cover and play smart. They RUSH you without regard of their own health. You have to pray that you and your group (if you have one) can kill them before they get close.  - The DZ is boring. It's a lot of running around, shooting NPCs to get another level ladder crawling up, hoping you get loot. Then you get it, try to get back to extract it, and bam : some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is leagues above you kills you JUST to kill you. But, the DZ is one of the better places to get gear. Well tough ♥♥♥♥. Then again not a lot of people go Rogue since there's no benefit from it. The DZ is just boring. - It's also impossible to get a good DZ group unless you just run into someone in there and they decide to join you. Matchmaking is useless for this. Seeing as you cannot matchmake inside the DZ makes it even more useless. You had best hope you find another lonely soul that doesn't just shoot you on sight. - There is no endgame. Once you hit level 30 and fill out your equipment with Highend equipment....eh. You can go after and hunt the gearsets, but that's really just doing the same mission over and over and over and over and over and over and hoping that if something drops it's not the EXACT SAME THING you already have. Besides that you get a couple of dailies. Once you complete those (About 15 minutes) you're too bored to continue playing. - There is no clan/guild system. You can't do something as basic as create a clan/guild name, invite friends, and have a system to talk to people when in game. Oh no. you have to relay your conversations through Uplay IF you can meet anyone that plays in game....because, really, the game is pretty much dead.  - Lastly for my list is that Ubisoft/Massive doesn't care. They promoted this game. They promised so much. They have so many resources available to make this an amazing experience...but they don't. Bugs that are gamebreaking are left in the game. Right now if you join a group, your UI doubles and you can't use it. This has led to people losing items. Gear. Skills being changed mid fight and wiping a group, etc. Where is the company? Where is the customer support? They're nowhere to be found because they have the money and that's the end of it.   This is an example of a DECENT enough game that's good for wasting time, if you're bored and have nothing better to do, that could have been great. Ubisoft/Massive failed this title. They got everyones hopes up, sold the game, and backed off. When other games do this, they get taken down from Steam and there is a widespread refund spree, but not in this case. People are still PRAYING that it gets as good as it should be and hold on by the skin of their teeth...but it won't. It's like they have 5 people who work on this title...2 days a week...for a few hours...and only if they want to. They let the community down. They let the Tom Clancy name down. They let every single person who spent $60 on this game down. And not because they didn't give us a decent platform to start with...but because once they realized they messed up they quit caring about it and us.   The Divison has been broken since day one. Almost everything they promised they removed. It's not as lush, vibrant, and expansive as they promised it was. We got the Bait and Switch. Now it's struggling to maintain an 8000 playerbase. So before you spend your hard earned money on this title...just don't. This is the game that COULD HAVE BEEN amazing, but it wasn't. This is the game that robbed us of our enthusiasm. This is the game that is dying a very sad and lonely death. You can argue that if you get an hour playtime for every dollar that you spent on a game makes it worth the money, but it doesn't. At 70+ hours, I saw all this game had to offer and am just..disappointed.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"If I were to write a review a few weeks ago, I'd give it a solid 9/10 and recommend this game to everyone.  It's an amazing game with beautiful graphics that runs pretty smooth even on my old PC. The city is well crafted with amazing little details on every corner, and main missions in general are pretty fun. Side activities are typical Ubisoft game though, kinda repetitive. Gunplay is so satisfying with great cover mechanics. Enemies (factions) are varied enough with their own characteristics. I can go either solo, play with friends or go with randoms via matchmaking to do everything in this game. The leveling experience in The Division is one of the best I've ever had in an mmo(lite). I'd give the 1-30 journey a solid 9/10.  And then I stumbled upon the endgame. The real meat of the game where I'm supposed to spend most of my time there. CM are really a challenge, however they're kinda limited in number. It was originally okay before the incursion patch hit, but everything has changed since then. It's way harder to get crafting materials post patch, which means you need to grind your ♥♥♥ to craft your weapon/gear. Incursion is a mess, people can exploit it to beat it way easier. Massive then remove weekly rewards so people who're not exploiting are basically screwed. You may choose to not use the exploits, but you'll be left behind others, and you definitely won't stand a chance in the Dark Zone where everyone is an exploiter. If you're a competitive player, you'll have to use the exploits. The first free update is the turning point of the game for me.   The game is a mess from its core. There are too many fundamental problems while maybe can be fixed, but will need a lot of work and testing. Massive can only find the exploits after the players abusing them. And when they do fix one, players find another two exploits. Every day there's new glitches and exploits, but they can only apply a patch once a week or two. And it's been going on since day 1. They just can't keep up with the pace of people finding new glitches. And you can't blame them for finding those exploits, the game isn't supposed to have ridiculous amount of them. It's been a month and this game feels like a beta for me. The Division is probably the most squandered potential of a game in years.

Its Nothing revolutionary, but what It does I would say It does well...   **If you know what you are getting Into a RPG based shooter &amp; not a twitch shooter/1 shot kill then you will probably really enjoy this game for what It is.  You will not be quick scoping or dealing out 1shot headshots, I dont care that hes wearing a hoodie. Think way less CoD/CSGo and think more Mass Effect/Witcher In terms of 'spongyness'..

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Full of hackers.  Full of bugs.  Full of terrible Ubisoft coding.  Even if all that was fixed, the game itself has no content unless you count mindless grinding to get better gear for no reason 'content'.    Please don't waste your money on this game, so many better titles out there that will bring you much more fun and you won't feel cheated after buying them.    Edit 6-1-2016 - Would like to elaborate on my comment about the terrible/lazy coding.  The company has one purpose which is to design, CODE &amp; publish games. They constantly screw it up with bugs, broken patches, no anti-cheat, failure to perma ban hackers, missing dailies, untested content full of exploits just to name a few. You can hardly say they are doing their job well if you pay any attention to this or any of the other releases they have put out in recent years.   The things I list are not even opinions, the lazyness and non-support for the game has allowed hackers to continue to run rampant. Honestly if they just fixed the hacking people like myself might do more than log in once a week to check what is in the DZ/BoO vendor - it would still have it's problems yes, but at least we could go more than 2 blocks in the Dark Zone without being headshot through a wall by a hacker.  Until then there are much, much better ways to spend your money and time. Please remember how bad this was when they bombard you with ads for Ghost Recon:Wildlands in the coming weeks, also remember I warned you! :)",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"The worst game ever.  Don't get me wrong. I love this game so much. I pre-order the Gold Edition on Steam with full price. And I've played for almost 700 hrs. I tried and played almost every aspect of the game. And I also constantly browsing and discussing on Division subreddit. Frankly speaking, this is really a nice game but the devs sucks.  + Really nice graphic. Although SnowDrop is a new game engine, the graphic still looks awesome. + Cover system is good for 3rd-person shooter. + Neat and clean UI design. Informative but minimal design.  - Connection problem as always. UBI servers are really bad that even worse in MMO. - Cheaters and hackers everywhere. No matter you're playing in PVP or PVE, there are TONS of cheaters makes the game totally unplayable. - Looting and crafting system are jokes. You may get nothing worthy for about 4 hours play since the loot drop is awful and the crafting requirements are unreasonable in some way. - The end-game is tedious. Maybe it's just because this is a new game, the lacking of end-game content makes you get bored very soon. - The new gamemode, Incursion, design is quite bad. Very small map with 15 waves of overlevel enemies only. - The PVP is totally unplayable due to cheating. And the elite enemies distribution is unbalanced and the rewards are not scale up with the difficulty. Everyone level up in DZ03, and nobody go to DZ06 since the rewards are almost the same as DZ01. - Currently there is no cheat detection system implemented. They try to find cheaters manually and it's inefficiency and inaccurate. - The ban is also a joke. Only 3-day ban for hacking before, and now it's only 14-day ban. Cheaters still cheating. - Lots of game breaking glitches and bugs.  Ubisoft ruined almost everything. And the support is really slow and unhelpful. I submitted a ticket to UBI support on 20th April, and got response on 6th May with unhelpful answer. Moreover, lots of problems/suggestions on Reddit were discussed. Redditors pinpoint the issues and even provide possible solutions. But devs never listen. Lots of game breaking issues are not fixed.  Actually I quit this game on 20th April, 2016. After a month later, there's still no improvement in Division. So I totally cannot recommend this game although I want to.  Good game, bad devs.  --  史上最差的遊戲。  別誤會，我很喜歡這款遊戲，我在Steam預購了黃金版，而遊戲時數接近七百小時，我嘗試並接觸過遊戲所有部分，同時我也常常在Reddit上參與討論。坦白講，這是一款好遊戲，但是爛開發商。  + 十分優異的畫面表現，雖然SnowDrop是個新引擎，但是整體畫面看起來很棒。 + 掩體系統在第三人稱射擊很方便上手。 + 簡潔乾淨的介面設計，適時的提供必要資訊卻又不會雜亂。  - 連線一樣老問題，UBI的伺服器實在是很差，尤其在這種強調多人連線的遊戲內更嚴重。 - 各種外掛作弊滿街跑，不論你玩PVP還是PVE，到處都是外掛跟作弊，讓整個遊戲幾乎無法正常進行。 - 掉落跟製作系統是個笑話，常常會打了四小時結果拿到的都是無用的垃圾，而製作材料需求設計又非常的誇張不合理。 - 貧乏的封頂內容，或許因為這是個新遊戲，但貧乏的內容讓你滿等後很快就會感到無聊。 - 新模式，襲擊，設計的頗差，只是一個非常小的地圖搭配15波超強的越等敵人而已。 - 到處都是外掛，PVP幾乎無法玩，而PVP的菁英敵人部屬非常不平衡，且獎勵也沒有隨難度提高，所有人都擠在暗區03升級，然後根本沒有人要去暗區06，因為獎勵跟暗區01差不多爛。 - 目前為止遊戲內完全沒有作弊偵測的系統，他們嘗試用人工的方式找作弊玩家，但非常沒效率而且不準確。 - 停權機制也是個笑話，之前抓到作弊只停權三天，現在提高了也只是十四天而已，作弊的仍然繼續作弊。 - 還有一堆讓遊戲完全無法正常運行的漏洞和bug。  Ubisoft幾乎毀掉了所有東西，而且官方客服效率極差，我4/20的時候提交了一個問題給官方客服，到5/6才收到回覆，而且回覆內容官腔又沒幫助。此外，在Reddit上很多人討論了許多潛在問題，並提出了可能的修改方式與建議，但官方幾乎都沒有採用，許多誇張的bug仍然沒有修正。  事實上，我在2016年4月20日就沒有再開過這款遊戲，現在過了一個月，看起來仍然沒有改進，因此雖然我很喜歡，但我仍然無法推薦這款。  好遊戲，爛公司。",-1,1

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"When it has all been said and done, I think most reviews and the criticisms of the The Division are warranted.   To sum it up in a nutshell, The Division is to gaming history, the most wasted potential videogame of all-time. It has an excellent premise, but it is poorly executed in not only gameplay, but story, environmental and level design, and NPC interactions, or lack thereof.   The lack of an anti-cheat system leaves you wondering what Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft were thinking during the planning, strategy, and conceptualization stages of development. Not only do hackers or players without a conscience continue to exploit this game, Massive has denounced a statement saying that an anti-cheat system is basically out of the question because 'we would need to build this game from the ground up again.'  Unlike some other The Division early adopters, I was never butt-hurt by the E3 gameplay, or the mad and sickening hype. Unfortunately for me, I do not understand why some blatantly obvious game designs were not in this game.   The streets of New York City is barren, even as pre-apocalyptic or apocalyptic world. Ubisoft and Massive should have opted for a ficticious city instead of a realistic New York. Trading a videogame fantasy world for a more realistic one is one of the major drawbacks to The Division's level and environmental design. The problem with this is, you have very little to work with because the developer tried too hard to be true to New York City's landscape, leaving little to the imagination.  The loot system is severely flawed. The 'Gear Rating System' Massive has in place is misleading. For example, a player can have a gear rating of 204, but have less damage per second, health, or skill power than a player with a gear rating of 190. Basically put, the gear rating is skewed and distorted.   I may not know everything about MMO-like or MMO videogames, but I have played my fair share. In that, I have some credibility as a gamer who once appreciated MMOs and especially MMO-RPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft (golden days), Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, Guild Wars 1 and 2, and modern ones like The Secret World. While I draw comparisons, I want to say that the MMOs I mentioned at least tried to bring in new game mechanics and MMO worlds that brought 'something new' and most importantly, fun gameplay and loot. The Division features loot as guns and 'gear,' which in some sense it does well. The character design is pretty to look at and the clothing, equipment, and armor all look great aethestically but nothing more.   The Division relies heavily on crafting and farming Pheonix credits which you would then trade in to a vendor to purchase new weapons, equipment, or blueprints. At the moment, players have to rely too heavily on crafting gear in order to take on the only incursion we have in the game. Daily assignments are few and far in between, so you would have to complete the daily assignments for Pheonix credits every day in order to rack up hundreds of credits to purchase the gun or blueprint that you need to pack any kind of punch for an incursion. *Massive did state with a recent update that they are attempting to remedy this issue. We will see about that.  MMOs have instances or dungeons and this is typically the meat of the endgame where players farm for loot or gear. Ubisoft/Massive 'gave' us an Incursion called 'The Falcon: Lost' as a free update. This is the problem and plague of the current situation of the videogame industry. 'FREE UPDATES' and what is it, really? The base game of The Division before the Incursion update was barebones as you can get. Very little content, as in, a few missions, and nodes on the map that would give you vertigo, thinking about Assassin's Creed's nodes on the map that induced OCD. This is probably the most shallow aspect of the game besides its story and NPC interaction in story mode.   On another note, The Division lacks any sense of threat. You never feel like the city is lost in shambles; not even in the Dark Zone, which is suppose to be the darkest corners of the game. Like I have said before, the game design falls short immediately when the player does not feel any sense of threat, urgency, and motivation to bring cause and effect to attention. Because simply, there is none. And that in itself is a sad fact of the game.   The Dark Zone is lackluster, full of hackers, and wasted potential. In DZ, you are doing the same thing over and over, and if you are expecting the dynamic of human vs human or PVP interaction in the same vein of DayZ and like games, you will be very disappointed. There are too many hackers. The punishment and reward system is severely flawed and it does not reward co-op players. One simple rule, as with past MMOs or MMO-like games is simply this: ADD A PVP TOGGLE ON OR OFF OPTION. It is that fvking simple.  You may be wondering why I have invested so many hours in The Division and have the audacity to 'thumbs down' the game in such hypocritical fashion. It's quite simple. I review games after I have given enough game time, especially when it is an MMO-like-style game. It is only fair. After a handful of updates with the addition of the 'free' incursion, and Massive's inability to resolve the glaring issues in the game, I cannot recommend it to anyone at this price point. I cannot even recommend the game for $1 because it would be a waste of your time. You are better off spending your time doing other things. Seriously. I mean this sincerely.  I could keep writing, going in to 'massive' detail about what should and should not be in The Division, but it would be an overwhelming task that only my mind can understand at the moment. Most players would agree that The Division is a huge wasted potential. The proportionality of negative to positive reviews is not only valid, but almost sound if you were to ever experience such disappointment without reconciliation of the fact you just wasted not only your hard earned cash, but also your valuable time.  Verdict: Not recommended. Avoid until Massive and Ubisoft implements an anti-cheat system and addresses and resolves several issues in the game. While I understand this is Massive's first roundabout at a game such as this one. It comes with its own challenges and complexities which deviate from the standard and traditional single-player and multiplayer affair. Even though I cut Massive some slack on that front, there are far too many minor and major issues Massive continues to overlook, which leaves me to question their approach and strategy to fix some of the game's many problems.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,I'll keep it nice and simple.  For the white knights commenting 'oh em gee 400 hours' Pay closer attention to the cons. You will notice majority of them listed came to light about a month after release.  Pros -Pvp -Graphics -Storyline (Being Generous)  Cons -Cheaters (No Anti Hack) 3 Day ban for the first offense.

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"I gave my best to make this game work, and it just chewed up my effort to like it and spat it back into my face.  Alright, let's start with the good in this game:  1. Immense potential to be a great PvP game, to play with friends, provided any of them stuck long enough thorugh the issues which is unlikely.  2. Initial part of the game is fun, but hitting level 30, everything goes downhill.  Now, onto to the downhill parts of the game:  1. Unless you were early enough to exploit and hack when Ubisoft didn't give a ♥♥♥♥, you're already behind, and catching up is a grindfest.  2. By a grindfest, I mean playing same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions over and over and over again with no variation, hoping that this time you get at least a miniscule amount of upgrade for your equipment.  3. Equipment sucks. Not only do you have to chase the flavor of the patch build to stay competitive, getting the actual items is not enough. If you don't roll good stats, and most likely, you won't, it's back to the start of the mission grind. You can do 10 or more incursion (best missions for item drops, also the hardest and most time consuming), and still be at the same point as you were in at the start of the game.  4. There's no enemy variety whatsoever. Bosses are the same ♥♥♥♥ing bullet sponge with a different name.  5. PvP is a joke. It's inherently broken, and every attempt to stop the overgeared players from stomping on casuals in PvP zones has failed miserably, and I don't see it ever improving.  6. Every actual improvement to this game feels like it's been forced by outside forces. New content? Coincidentally same day as Overwatch release. Massive finally caring about rampant hacking and exploiting? Probably because 90% of the player base already abandoned the game and Overwatch already showed 0 tolerance towards hacking.  This was a game of immense potential, but it's been built on shabby foundations and it will never get better. Ubisoft has cashed in on another bestseller, and they are moving their attention elsewhere. The barren wasteland that's The Division is not, and will never be worth your time.  Stay away.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Whew, got that outta the way, now let's get on with the Pros first before I tear this POS game a new one.  Pros:- -The world looks gorgeous. -Progression from Level 1 - 30 is enjoyable and umm.... I guess that's it.  Cons:- This might be one of the worst full price AAA game that I ever had the displeasure of purchasing. This game quite possibly has every single problem that any other AAA game has, encapsulated in a single broken game. Unbalanced, Buggy, Toxic community, you name it, The Division is suffering from it. What's baffling is the fact that, not only was it suffering these problems on release day, it's still suffering from this problem MONTHS after it's initial release. In fact, each update aggressively makes this game worse. The developers somehow think that since other games had this problem, that means they get a free pass to do it too.  Now let's get into the bad points.  -The Worst Endgame I have possibly seen in an game:- Courtesy of;  -Unbalanced PVP that is MANDATORY:- No skills needed. Why? Because a full geared No-Lifer can be in the same instance with someone who is just fresh Lvl 30 with no gear.  -Weighted loot drops to hinder PVE player's progress:- Functions to funnel people into the Dark Zone. Basically pushing PVE players to become sheep for the PVP Griefers in there. Hence mandatory PVP. Oh and it's not balanced.  -Multiple layers of RNG:- I'm talking Inception layers of deep here. (RNG for the item you want)x(RNG of item LVL)x(RNG of basic stats)x(RNG of item talents)x(RNG of bonus attributes). Worst part? Item of lower level can still drop in high areas, and High Level items can have ♥♥♥♥♥ier stats than that of lower level items.  -Unbalanced and useless talents:- Really only 3 usable skills, others are subpar or downright bugged/glitchy  -Numerous bugs and glitches:- Ubisoft trying to be the new EA.  -Toxic community:- When you've got a game that encourages and rewards Griefing, (I.E; Any method of reversing another player's progress), you will attract these type of people.  -Arrogant f-word developers:- They don't know what they're doing, but they know how to nerf anything that is beneficial to the player. E.g; A bug that dropped four High End items are patched within hours but Glitches that disabled hundreds from accessing their characters are fixed after A MONTH.  Now you might say I'm being a little harsh but after suffering the mental torture that this game has inflicted on me, I'd say I'm being a tad bit generous.  Damn you Ubisoft and Massive, you make EA look like Angels  TLDR; DO NOT BUY!",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Uninstalling this game was more satisfactory than being cured of hemroids  I didn't enjoy this game the entire 133.6 hrs i played it. Funny thing is i didn't realize that i hated it untill i uninstalled it. What a relief no more of the carrot on a stick repetitive loot grind. I just wanted the perfect gear and DPS so i forced myself into playing it for hrs on end doing the same thing over, and over and ♥♥♥♥ing over just to get a slight numbers gain.

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"TL;DR: PvP is terrible and allows no-lifers to prevent other players from ever acquiring gear to compete with them in Dark Zone fights.  The Review:   Let me preface this by saying I have played since first Beta. I also played the second Beta and have also played since launch. So I can give a bit more insight than some. With that, let's get ♥♥♥♥ed.   PROS     Huge, well detailed city   Cool Concept   Good Customization for Character Outfit   First 20-30 hours are amazing   That's it. That's all the pros. They explain themselves.    CONS     You MUST follow Meta to win.   Poorly thought out long-term goals for players   Lack of foresight about possible player stats/loadout choices   Poor execution with weapons that can NOT take attachments   Undiverse set of options for character creation   Lack of defined classes for characters   Undiverse set of weapon choices (i.e. Meta Only)   PvP is terribly thought out and executed   Too many stats on gear that need to be perfect, no way to fix it   Drops are usually worse than what you have.   Crafting barely alleviates issues with gear/weapons.   Developers show lack of care on fixing Quality of Life issues (things have been asked for since Beta, still no fix)   The player base has dropped over 93% since launch.   Now the cons need explaining.      If you don't follow Meta, you will lose every fight. Period. This is the number one rule of The Division.    The developers clearly lacked any thought for what players would do in End-Game besides PvP in the Dark Zone. Thing is, the PvP is so terrible and the choices so undiverse even in update 1.2, that its boring and unfun. You will get stomped time and again by the same people because stats are what decide matches, not skill. Very few choices can even the odds, and usually its not enough. People all use the same Ultimate Skill, Survivor Link, the same weapons, Vector, AUG, and M1A, and only about 4 or 5 variants of skills of the 40+ available skills choices. The meta is stale. And if you don't conform to the Meta, you will lose every fight. Your skill in shooters and smart planning mean nothing here.    Massive, the development team, lack any sort of modicum of thought representing a coherent amount of foresight. They bring out the game to Beta, only give 1 Shotty, 2 Rifles and 1 LMG for High-End. We find out in release week that the best weapons are SMGs and Marksman rifles, and this could have averted the meta had we seen a High-End SMG or DMR in beta. They gave these weapons special damage buffs that made them clear choices above all else. Then, they fail to rectify the issue until, possibly, update 1.3 (to be seen). Then bring out gear sets. Find out that the one's that give damage buffs are definitively better and complain that people mix-and-match the pieces for optimum DPS and survivability without making sure you needed a full set to get the bonuses that mattered most. Then, instead of fixing this issue for ALL sets and making them all good, they nerf the meta ones. Tanktician meta starts and they ignore it. They put things in the game, and then don't do proper QA testing to see whats possible. They raise defensive caps on damage reduction and wonder why everyone has ridiculous amounts of HP and can't die.      Explains itself. If you have a Police Magnum or an M9, you'd think the Magnum would deal more damage right? Wrong, because they are nearly comparable in single hit damage at end game and the M9 can take extended mags, a silencer and a laser sight which all give EVEN MORE STATS. As the game goes on, attachments become more powerful, meaning those strong, single hit weapons are left behind further.     There are like, maybe 10 options for character face and a few marks and sunglasses. Woo. Everyone looks like a Russian, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off white-guy, a crazy asian or a mad black guy.     Since there aren't defined classes, everyone can use any skill. Which mean everyone takes the same skills and gear if possible, with very little diversity because certain things are clearly better than others in both PvP and PvE. Better to the point that you are handicaping yourself harshly if you don't follow Meta. (See 1)    If you don't take the Aug, Vector, or M1A, you are handicapping yourself. M44 only if you use explosive rounds. Assault rifles, LMGs and Shotguns are trash tier. The damage difference is overwhelming. Coming up in 1.3, they are making changes to these. Truth is, the changes will be poor at best and the meta will still remain. If you don't follow meta, you lose. (See 1)    Want to know what PvP is like in The Division? Imagine you are playing multiplayer in Gears of War. Fun right? Well imagine to get new weapons you had to win matches against near invincible players who can sometimes 1-3 shot you. Sounds less fun? I couldn't imagine why people don't like the Division PvP. You just have to no-life once a new update hits and then you can hold down other players with the new Meta to prevent challenge! So much fun! Right? Then, imagine in Gears of War, the cover system gets you killed more than helping you survive. Skill doesn't exist in The Division. Just stats. Playing smart doesnt exist.    All the gear has numerous stats. Each one is in a certain 'slot' and you can only ever re-roll 1 slot on that gear. Once you choose the slot, you can't re-roll another. And the price goes up more each roll. And its still RNG based. Basically, if you don't craft or get a drop that is near perfect minus 1 slot, its garbage and won't help you minus being money or resources to break down. This means most loot is useless and makes the game unfun as its a loot-based shooter with bad loot.    Self-explanatory.     Crafting was nerfed because it was a way for players to get around the RNG a bit. Now that its barely useful as BPs don't exist for 240 gear, RNG is back in full swing. This is an awful idea.    Players: Can you make weapon skins go into our cosmetics so it doesn't take up space? Massive: NO. Players: Can you at least expand our Stash size to being bigger than our backpacks? Massive: ♥♥♥♥ NO. Players: Can we at LEAST get enemies that don't one shot anything that isn't a tank build? Massive: Literally Kill Yourselves.    Think about this one. The player base has dropped by 93% since launch day. That is insane. They have lost most of their players and the daily average on based on Steam's Stats is dropping daily. If they don't fix these cons, they won't have a playerbase left to save their city. Truth is, the PvP was to be a driving factor. But because there is no skill involved, its all numbers, its become boring and repetitive. People avoid combat if they aren't maxed out in gear and stats because they KNOW they will lose. People avoid the DZ because its unfun to be killed and unable to even defend yourself due to, not your lack of skill or knowledge, but stat desparity. Its pathetic.  ",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"EDIT Between the ~~~  Original Post:  After looking at some of the reviews on here I feel like 90% of them are complete bull.   1) Server crashed... okay, good for you but I started playing this as soon as I got off work until just now and had litterally zero issues with the server. The fact that they fixed their server problem in less than a day is fine by me. I've seen many games launch and not be playable for a week (diablo 3?)  2) Uplay sucks... how? I clicked the copy code to clipboard button when steam prompted me to, uplay asked for code, i pressed ctrl+v and hit enter, division launched and played just fine. I have not had to open Uplay once in order to play this game so how this is a problem I don't know.  3) Graphics suck... ummm get a better card? I have a GTX970 and am playing 55+ fps on average with dips down to about 40 with a lot going on outside at 1440p. BTW the game looks amazing in 1440p.  4) Grinding for gear... well yeah genius, if you couldn't figure out from the OPEN beta and countless of youtube videos and news articles that this was similar to destiny or diablo in its kill badguy to get better loot to kill harder badguy game then you're an idiot. Don't buy a genre you dont like.  5) AI is bad... It's an RPG style cover based shooter where the AI uses the cover. yes they will pop their head out to shoot at you after a few seconds. Oddly enough this is exactly what you are doing after you reload, does this make you a bad player? Does the AI act like a real human in any other RPG you've played?  Now that that is out of the way, this game has been out less than a day. I can't say if this is something I am going to play for months or not, but I have enjoyed it so far and have had no reason to give it a bad review. If I decide the game actually is bad in a week or so I will revisit this and add an edit to the end. If this is the last line you see then I still feel like its a good game and not anywhere near as bad as people are making it out to be.  ~~~ I did not realize everyone on steam was going to read/comment on this. I will edit this review with actual opinion about the game once I have completed the main story and put some more time into it.   Finished the main story and got BoO to 100% in just over 38 hours played. (happened almost at the same time do to my completionist play style)  So far the only negatives I have are that microphone is defaulted to voice sensetivity rather than PTT which is annoying but I can mute people. Dark zone feels lackluster, roaming mobs and stationairy groups at the landmarks. other than that there isnt much to do in the DZ unless you go rogue and kill other players. The side missions and encounters were almost all carbon copies of one another which I suppose could get boring. realiztically there are a limited number of them total so its only repetative for a little while. I enjoyed the story. The amount of content included is more than enough to get you to max level. I hit level 30 after completing the final mission and I have only a few side missions and encouters to do. I wont go too much into gameplay because if you are reading this, chances are you have seen some gameplay on youtube and my typing is not going to describe it nearly as well as a video can. I'm looking forward to gearing up for what is to come and playing new content as it comes out.   Maybe I will update this as more content is realeased. If you are reading this I decided not to since youtube will pretty much have you covered. ~~~",1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,DO NOT BUY  Riddled with gamebreaking bugs and hackers.  No hotfixing (exploits being in the game for weeks). No proper anti-cheat system is implemented. No testing before release. No endgame content. No reliable way of getting new gear/upgrades. Ubisoft/Massive blames the playerbase for their own obvious mistakes.  Each patch seem to take away from the player. No communication with the community. Customer support is non-existant.,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,CHEAT SIMULATOR,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Tom Clancy’s The Hacker Simulator™  Another producut by Ubisoft that failed in all aspects. You will enjoy game first 20-30 hours but then when you start playing dark zone pvp you will uninstall game like 70% of division community. My opinion dont buy game because its full of glitches, exploits and hackers. There is no report system and best of all  no anti cheat system . My biggest mistake is spending 60$ on this game so you dont do same as me. One more thing i want to add to this review MASSIVE devs stay away from developing games. Stay away from this game!  Edit#1: 06/28/2016  PATCH 1.3  Ok so i played patch 1.3 i see small improvements. I played Dark Zone and i didnt face cheater for 30 mins (but i still think you will face cheaters cos of no anti cheat system). There is a glitch with Season pass. When you start mission with your friends guess what infinite mission loading because game doesnt recognize you own Season pass. They manage to fix other glitches and exploits and create new one. They put new weapon balance in game that is rly good because you will use other guns not only smg and sniper. I still dont recommed this game; those developers dont know what they are doing (fixing old bugs and creating brand new bugs). Guys i dont hate Tom Clancy’s Division im only trying to tell you whats going on with this game. Ubisoft will lose so much trust because of Massive developers.  Edit#2: I will update review when patch 1.3 (fix come) and also patch 1.4 this summer.  Thanks for reading!",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division, I really want to like this game.   This review is written based on version 1.1.    Pros:,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Can you guys just fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game rather than creating 6million hotfixes that just ended up breaking something else. For a game with so much potential, you guys manage to somehow wipe your ♥♥♥ with it, or should I say with everyone's money.  Patch 1.2 is out and Jesus Christ they dropped the ball...ONCE AGAIN One is none is still broken, Incursions are STILL teleporting players bac (This time it happens even if it is just started GJ), map is now bugged, there are INVISIBLE walls in the ♥♥♥♥ Zone, still haven't fixed the damn dialog box 'You have new master mods' after weeks of that being there, and the cherry on top... THE GREATEST THING IS THAT NOW PLAYERS THAT KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY PlAYED WITH A HACKER ARE NOW GETTING BANNED, SO A BAN WAVE CAME THROUGH ATTACKING LITERALLY ANYONE THAT EVEN SO MUCH AS UTTERED THE WORDS 'Pls don't be hacking' GOOD ON YOU DIVISION, YOU ARE TRULY GIVING A NEW MEANING TO BEING MENTALLY HANDICAPPED.  A few weeks ago when the game first dropped, I was hyped so it would have easily gotten a 9/10 from me, but that's no longer the case. To be honest, the game started out nicely with the introduce of the base of operations and ♥♥♥♥ like that. But the way they put you in the game...they put you in as if you've never clicked a mouse or used a keyboard in your life.   The game is broken to hell and back. It's as if they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to fix the game, a title that was broken at LAUNCH, now this is Ubisoft we're talking about, and I'm ashamed to say it but I had faith that they wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ up this idea of a post apocalyptic New York.  People that were able to hit level 30 and get the Midas before the first patch, they were basically invincible if they had survivor link and the correct roll on the Midas, this was patched soon after word got out, good on you Massive, but wait, THERE'S MORE THAN JUST ONE BUG!  Textures were ♥♥♥♥ing up left right and center.  Physical areas sometimes wouldn't load in, causing people to fall to their death through the ground.  Bulletking...  There are so many cheaters to the point where it has gotten TOO out of hand, with no anti-cheat and a broken report system, it's free range on literally everybody and it is almost impossible to go in the darkzone without finding a guy that won't put his fist in your ♥♥♥ through a wall, using aimbot, and 10000 rpm.  P.S. with the report, you need video proof of said person doing it, so I hope you've got shadow played my dudes  The missions are completely copy and paste and offer little to no team work sometimes.  Missions can be farmed 24/7 (Lincoln tunnel and Lorraine mainly).  The incursions were brought it as something of a new way to bring players together to work as one productive unit, at least to me. It did the exact opposite. Team work was about 5% of the mission, the other 95% were literally just trying not to get one shotted by shotgun rushers with 2million dps and 6million health and armor. And on top of that, there was a glitch where you could go through a wall using the smart cover that would get you into the play area without really starting the mission, making it so that you could destroy the APC using the sticky launcher.  In the 1.1 update, they ♥♥♥♥ed crafting to hell with making a HUGE increase in the amount of materials needed to craft another material/gear.    They're solution isn't to fix the ♥♥♥♥ ups in THEIR coding, their solution is to ban the people who found a way through their ♥♥♥♥ coding.  They figure out a way to make players go 'Hey, that's pretty good' and then make them say 'Kill yourself'  The game itself is beautiful and I really like the work that they put into making this New York look so amazing, that seems like the one thing they got right.  In short, I would either not buy the game, wait until EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING THING IS FIXED (BUT WE KNOW THAT ♥♥♥♥ WON'T HAPPEN), or wait until it becomes about $20 in about a year or so.  Ubisoft, fix this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing coding. Get a ♥♥♥♥ing anti-cheat in place. Stop adding more clothing packs until you fix what needs to be fixed. Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing crafting system. And fix the ♥♥♥♥ing DZ, and I don't mean by adding new brackets, I mean by not making ♥♥♥♥ ridiculously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tough to get like some ♥♥♥♥ in the DZ03 vender, you aren't adding any value to the game by forcing people to grind in the ♥♥♥♥ zone until level 90, you are just making them play this copy and paste mission simulator longer.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Bought the season pass (EVERYTHING) for 100$. Played about 237 hrs. tl:dr opinion: Just press the back button of your browser. Paid content for season pass will come at summer and i wont even download it.   Extra info: this was my first ubisoft purchase, and also was first season pass/preorder thing. Those who familiar with ubisoft can laugh at me, i deserved it.  It'll be lengty review, SO IF YOU DECIDED TO BUY the game, i strongly advise that you read all as this may be your last salvation chance before you face your demise.  -----  1- Lies Everything about this game is a huge lie. I cant express how this community-manager gone full mad. When the developer say something on the stream or anywhere, players can be sure it IS a lie. Because they lied so many times, not like implying things but straight up lies. Examples: Season pass owner should've got so many things by now (Exclusive Drops, Montly Events and Sports outfit.) What people get is a level 7 weapon that you will never use (you'll get it at level 8, its a shotgun which no one use), montly events are 'under development' yet they still advertises with season pass, exclusive drops are just bunch of craps that you can farm in 3 minutes. And we had a promise for 'Sports Outfit' which they advertised with season pass and they said 'Oh ♥♥♥♥ it, we never said it'll be free, pay for it guys.' The dev says 'we wont change X in next update' and boom 3 days later they did change it, it was something about craft system and people adjusted their crafts for this piece of lie. I really really dont get into E3 trailer and the features shown there, it was a embodiment of lie, really goodjob over there, im not even mad, thats awesome how you milk your sheep customers like these. These are straight up lies with many others at developer streams. I just cant take it anymore, i'll just hate the all the development team.   1a Advertisement Lies This would, alone, make a book or seperate PHD documentary. Im not talking about little things like how this game is the farthest thing to be 'cover based shooter' as they advertised. Im talking about straight lies from directly developers. They say every lie to sell the game with preorder or with season pass, including false bundles, free items, exclusive content (not exist).   2-The Biggest Wasted Opportunity The city is HUGE, not only that is AWESOME, like they create a beautiful city and say '♥♥♥♥ the rest'. You'll only stay in it and grind till level 30 (40 hrs) then you will never see it. With the patch 1.2 they try to make you replay the city but it just dont work. It gets repetitive too soon too fast. Only way to enjoy the game and see some diversity/challenge is going DZ which i explain later.  3-Cheaters After level 30 (if not earlier) you have to grind at Dark Zone(multiplayer zone) always. Which is a nest for cheaters. The game uses client trust protocol which means you can do whatever cheat you want, teleport around, kill all the server with one single shot(yes it exist) etc. And since best loot is in the Dark Zone you have to go there and get killed by a cheater. After patch 1.1 they banned 'many' cheaters but Ubisoft is the worst publisher in term of an anti-cheat. It just dont exist, Massive is banning people manually which would take years to ban all cheaters. GG. There are many many cheater vulture at dz, and it wont get resolved before ubi implement an anticheat system, which will never happen.  one last hilarious thing about cheating, probably you didnt know: every week some developer plays the game and stream it. Can you actually believe that developer got rekt by a blatant cheater over and over, after that the dev just shut down the PC and get on the xbox. Can you ♥♥♥♥ing believe it? And do you know what dev did? He just noted his nickname with a pencil and paper (there is a cheater list on the paper). Yeah, thats right. Thats how devs will solve it, manually, coming up at 2036. Wp.  Please go youtube for the video.  4-Poorly Designed Loot System The city is good but this is a LOOT-GRIND game, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up the loot system you dont have a game. And by looking other games from the genre like Destiny or Diablo, this game, by far, has the poorest design. They create many different weapons and armor pieces with each of them has 4-12 ability or option WHICH all of them vary. The thing is you need 1 SPESIFIC one that actually you can use (or the BIS item for you [best in slot]) you cant craft it so you have to loot for it, and your chance is %0.0000000001 if not less, there is not a SINGLE player who compleated his/her armor weapons without cheating. So most of time you go Dark Zone, grind for 4-5 hours, get the base check your loot, DECONSTRUCT ALL for crafting material which give you material for 1 try, try crafting, fail. Aaaaaand ZERO. Imagine doing this for 2-3 weeks, if you enjoy this, buy the game. The thing with this game is like making a rabbit run with a carrot on the stick, ubisoft never give you the carrot and thus you will never complete your gear or not even feel little satisfaction or success after hours of play.  5-BUGS Oh my Lord. Its really amazing how much bugs can a single game contain, its alot even for a early access indie board game, let alone this is AAA title game from ubishit. It'd only make sense if they make their drunk intern to code this game. Do you know whats more amazing? The duration of these bugs stay in the game. I'll give you headlines and most annoying ones and let you imagine (or see for yourself if you are stupid) the rest. The notorius ground bug: When game started there was a bug cause you to fall from the ground to abyss. Devs said they'll fix it, and now, after 2.5 months later, it still exists. I can assure you this bug is the most annoying bug that ever existed in game history. You can fall from pretty much anywhere, anytime.There is a skill in game, that allow you a deploy a cover on the ground, you say 'Since this is a cover-based-shooter, it must be very op/nice skill' but no, even if you unlock all of its features, its one of the worst skill of all time, but hey, thats not the case, the special thing about that cover IT HAS BUGY INTERACTION WITH EVERYTHING in the ♥♥♥♥ing game. You deploy it near wall, voila you are now 'no-clip'. Deploy it ground, voila, you can fall from ground. Deploy it near missions, voila, fast forward the end of the mission. There is a ♥♥♥♥ing GUIDE TO USE IT as glitch. Guess what, how Ubi deal with/fix it? WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING UBI WAY: devs 'Dont use it, or we'll ban you'. Hilarious! There are glitches makes your inventory contain more item than it should, or make you carry more health packs/ammo. Funny thing is DEVS ARE USING THEM ON THEIR STREAM. Dude i dont know what to say more than this, even this game's very own devs accepts the bugs/glitches and go with it.  6- Disappointment As i said before, this games marketing(lie) budget is about same as game budget. Many people caught by the hype and bought gold edition at the day1. As people realised game is nowhere near at the point advertised, they start to leave, but many people wait including me, as most of us know that upcoming patches may fix the issues. And after 2.5 month i left the game with many others, because hype is already dead, and devs are nowhere near the fix the issues. Maybe just maybe, the division would be good game at 2017, but by the time there wont be many players to see it. Many of players that left the game, leave with great anger and disappointment, that no matter what we wont return. Annnd lets face it, its ubisoft, it wont fix the game, it'll release a new game. Because we are already milked.Also check SteamDB about player counts if you dont believe me.   Believe me there are many issues other than those. If you are Don Quijote, go for it and face your demise.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,I expected much from the game before its release but I knew Ubishit would fail yet again. Didnt preorder the game and didnt bought it in the first week to wait for reviews. After a while a friend convined me to buy so I play in the darkzone with him. Thought PvP would actually be enjoyable.   Oh Boy.... was I wrong....  After I bought the game I realized I have to play through the campaign first to get on my friends level as the PvP area is splitted by level...  So I played all the campaign missions (thats the reason for the playtime...) and oh boy was that boring...  In the entire game are like 4 different models for enemy AI... All weapons play and feel the same (only difference is if u play shotgun or sniper) but aside from that gaining a new weapon does absolutely nothing except changing the numbers...   Enemies are just bullet-sponges. Bosses are just normal AI with better Clothing and instead of having to do certain stuff to kill them you just have to put 1000 shots of your light machine gun in their head. like what? thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...   All Missions feel the same. there is no diversity in map design or how to approach your enemy.. you always run into a new area - hide behind a wall - throw grenades oder the wall and give each AI 50 Headshots to kill them - run into the next area.... Thats all. Thats the entire game.   PvP is a bit more interesting since AI in Campaign is stupid af. But its still boring...   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY thx,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"**** me, where to start with this game... Probably one of the most anticipated games ever, and now, the player-base is basically non-existant. The only players left are hackers, cheaters, and desperate fanboys who refuse to believe that their once beloved 'The Division' has been reduced to a mindless grindfest with less than 2,000 active players. This game had so much potential. SO MUCH. And the developers f*cked us over and gave us this piece of f*cking ****. I can`t believe that the developers are still asking for the same price that the game had at launch, 60 f*cking bucks. If it was a 10 or 15 dollar game then sure, this review would probably be positive. But 60 bucks? That`s a blatant scam, no matter how you look at it.  This is a great example of how effective marketing can fool a large group of people to believe that a product is actually going to be good. Do yourself a favour and forget that this game ever existed, and leave, just like the other 90% of the playerbase did.",-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Ok, SO i have played this game for a crazy amount of time. and i will say the game is really great, although the game is boring at the begining / middle area of the game and the boss are very repetitive the last few missions of the game show extreme potential and are extreme fun and challenging. I have completed the game and pretty much tested everything. so i guess i can atempt to list some of the things i found awesome and some not.  Awesome Stuff 1. Challenging Difficulty is freaking insane, it isnt just a small step above hard its a very large jump, it gives you a challenge and there is no way in hell you are just picking this up at fresh 30 and just farming your ♥♥♥ some Superior items unless you're the dankest memer the world has ever seen.  2. Final mission, Without spoiling to much its very difficult ( if you do it on hard solo ) and shows extreme potential for raid content and variety in the game instead of just shooting bosses or hitting T and just holding yourr left click.  3. Darkzone, The darkzone is crazy cool and the concept is rich with potential, only complaint is it kinda encourages you to just stealthly betray people rather than full on pvp. But the PVE aspects are great and the rush from getting your first High grade item and trying to evac it is just great.  4. The content seems to be planned on a consistent basis. we can hope that they stick to it but for now they have already planned out the first 3 expacs for this game, only downside is you gotta pay for them or the season pass.  Bad things in the game?   1. It is really hard for players that do the game solo, its very doable but if you're not good at shooters its not going to be that easy, they do have the matchmaking system but lets be honest past the first few first months of this game the lower levels wont be able to do much match making.   2. Until about level 25 the game is a cake walk, and the content is pretty repetitive, at the start you are immersed and loving them game and then you get to id say about level 10 and its just boring for the next 15 levels. ( luckily its fast leveling )  3. pvp exists but its not instance based or really encouraged. having something like a battleground or arena or something of this nature would help the pvp driven players find that thing that is missing, darkzone pvp is stale and boring and no body wants to lose xp or coins right now so yeah.   4. Its 60$ plus another like 30$ for the season pass. In this day in age your game better have some craaaazy content to be 60$, For instance not even WoW does 60$ expansions anymore, its just not a good idea. Especially with the content in game right now i dont think this game is 60$ value, in june or so, maybe, Because then we get a new expansion.   OK The last thing i would like to bring to late is the idiots saying this game is repetitive and server crash issues are stupid etc etc. Its repetitive because its an MMO with shooter aspects, not the other way around. If you look at every single MMO out there, it is repetitive, even the sandbox mmos have repetition. Server crash issues should be expected the first day a game is out, its server flooding and the beta as good as it was doesnt really give you a 100% sure idea when a game comes out, most games experience lag and dcs day one or in first few hours. Now that the game is a few days old servers are fine and gameplay is really smooth. Hope this review helps and good luck!

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"## Edit 6/11/16 I have been told Ubi is now offering perma bans to hackers and the community is on it's way to recovery. I will attempt to log in and check and update shortly, please see comments for more info##  Pros - Concept - Story - Story telling - love that you learn the back story through so many ways, qsts, phone calls, echos, journals, the details painted on desks and walls and even post it notes!  - Details, the game is FULL of them. Lots of nice touches. - Graphics (though certain points glitched for me when server stability would spike and people would dc) - Game Play - UI - Diversity of Missions - mmo style fps.  Negatives - Lack of End Game - Talents and Skills on gear are often flat out WRONG - Bugs from alpha still have not been addressed. - Every patch has new exploits, and I swear at this point I think Ubisoft/massive are purposely putting them in the game. Some of the exploits there is no way I feel a player NATURALLY just found it. - Dark Zone is impossible to play due to the hacks - Hackers do NOT get a permamnent ban, they get multiple WARNINGS instead.... - Community... it is negative and filled with every language spamming the chat nonstop - Adding Friends in the game is a pain you have to go to the ubisoft system you cannot do it in game ui itself. - CHARACTER CREATION.

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Update 01/10/2016:  Since the game has updated again and I seldom played the game after v1.2, the comment MAY BE OUTDATED. However, I did try the Underground DLC, which is better than the former s h i t but still not worth my $60, so still NOT RECOMMEND.  PS: I have got a rude comment recently about my spending hundreds of hours with a negative comment, calling me 'hypocritical'. It is the first time I know that playing much keeps me from thumbs down, which is 'hypocritical' from a guy without public profile. Ha-ha.  Of course I deleted it in no time.   ------------------------------------------------------------  Warning: slight spoiler alert  The game has wonderful stories, wonderful art design, and a big title of Tom Clancy.  But it is not a good game at all. It is full of deception.  In the first 20 hours, you survive alone in ruin NYC, everything seems to be new, attracting and challenging.  And then you get to lvl 30.   You enter the DZ, get killed by all kinds of cheaters and hostile players. It sucks.  You try to clear Daily Missions, have equipment with better GS, spends hours on a stupid Challenge Mission. It is stupid, because the golden gear of lvl 182 is nothing comparing to the new gear set in the new mission, which is too hard that those who made it can't pass it in one try. And it will soon get out-of-time in no time.  And Ubisoft have run the game perfectly against the normal player, fixing every bug that make players grow quickly in a rush while leaving those cheaters as the king of the world. Not to mention the spam message in the public channel and the awful potato servers with frequent disconnect, lag and error.   The biggest sadness is that when you realize all of this, you have passed the refund time.  That's why I call it deception.  General Score:  0/10 Not recommend  +4 Great Story  +4 Great TPS experience  -8 Ubisoft running, no anti-cheating mechanism, terrible servers with force Internet links  PS: I won't purchase any Ubisoft game again. (I would use pirate copies if the game were really attracting.)  Update 27/4/2016:   Recently I saw Ubisoft's efforts against cheating by moving some of the mechanism from local clients to the servers, such as reload clip. In a way it makes the game more 'realistic': your weapons may stuck time to time and you can't reload or shoot for a few second. In fact it is only caused by lag. I save those complaints and let you friends imagine what will happened if your weapon failed in a war zone.   I have heard that the designers put some parts of calculating on local clients to relieve the bundle of servers, which is the source of unstoppable cheating. Now they wanna correct it by moving them online step by step. Let us see if the newest gourmet from France are fried potato chips.  Update 15/05/2016: The most desperate thing is that you can't shoot, can't heal yourself, can't use first-aids, no DPS to the enemies but they can still shoot you dead. THAT is the worst thing in the game even for a gamer spent hundreds of hours on it.  Update 25/05/2016: Update 1.2 is alive. The boring daily&amp;weekly are removed, instead, a much boring system of daily and weekly is live now. I don't see any need to do these search&amp;destroy things, just a set of mission done before. Haven't done new missions yet. Maybe better, maybe worse, but never worth the price.",-1,1
