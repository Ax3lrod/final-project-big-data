105600,Terraria,you can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun you can build teleporters find a hair dresser in a spider cavern and get a sword that shoots cats you can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn you can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble it would seem the only thing minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension trust me once you get used to it and start learning about the game terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there it may sound rude but compared to this minecraft just has no imagination,1,0

105600,Terraria,to commemorate the beta of steam reviews as well as passing 1000 hours in team fortress 2 it only makes sense that i finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day i was first introduced to it terraria terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it between lenient system requirements a solid albeit imbalanced at times combat system a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor its the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone which is good when you consider that it also has multiplayer even better when you get to the late game which has a wide array of weapons armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game but the gameplay mechanics are something id like to single out for praise for a 2d game its combat system has a lot of spectacle and perhaps thats part of why i find it so charming hurting enemieseven those who are vastly inferior to youfeels good its satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die ground movement could be better but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly which really expand how you can explore and fight and with a wide selection of weapons every player is bound to find a roster of tools spells and fishrelated artillery that fits their playstyle the game isnt without flaws mind you with the games update history the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one this has led to some balance and progression issues the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels it worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing when they might love what the late game has to offer the game also has a bad habit of recycling mob ai with reskins though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact even though i have more to say about the shortcomings theres just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking plus it has hats any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points watch some trailers read some other reviews if this looks like something youd be interested in then take it from me give terraria a chance the game occasionally goes on sale for 75 off so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends if im wrong then i cost you a meal at subwaynot subliminal advertisingand im sorry but if im right then itll be well worth the price were expected to pay 60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience this is one thatll run you 10 at most,1,1
105600,Terraria,the fact that people call this a copy of minecraft astounds me,1,1
105600,Terraria,many people compare terraria and minecraft and its true they are both voxel based mining games however terraria tones down a lot of what minecraft is in building and creativity then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system dont get me wrong you can still build interesting and exciting structures in terraria but the awe that some minecraft creations can inspire is not found in terraria if you prefer emphasis on combat boss battles and equipment upgrades but still want to be able to mine resources create defenses and terraform to your desire terraria is most certainly a good fit theres a reason its my most played game on steam and even as i write this i have the game open on psn to play with my friends,1,1
105600,Terraria,well a new terraria update there goes another 200 hours of my life tell my family i love them,1,0
105600,Terraria,by the numbers,1,1
105600,Terraria,you can nuke waves of zombies with explosives bunnies you can pelt santa claus to death with rotten eggs you can murder enemies with bananas you have to sacrifice your guide to the gods of hell to progress the game and one of the bosses is a pig shark dragon walrus mutant named duke fishron play it already,1,0
105600,Terraria,have you ever wanted to fight a giant eyeball that has teeth by using a laser cannon that you obtained from an alien invasion while riding your giant bee then this game is for you have you ever wanted to drink water while drowning to restore health so that you dont drown then this game is for you have you ever wanted to explore a vast underground land of ash and lava then this game is for you have you ever wanted an arsenal of unique and fun weapons to use each with their own weird and wacky abilities from firing nyan cats to summoning ice dragons then this game is for you have you ever wanted lore that is almost entirely up to interpretation then this game is for you have you ever wanted to fight the moon itself well too bad they scrapped that idea but still have you ever wanted to have a good time then this game is for you like seriously its a fun game lots of replay value too,1,0
105600,Terraria,its like 2d skyrim in the sense that once you start none of your family will see or hear of you for weeks,1,0
105600,Terraria,ubisoft games the screenshots look better than the game this game the game looks better than the screenshots ya those screenshots are outdated srsly tho even some negative reviews said they were joking,1,1
105600,Terraria,when i first saw my friend playing terraria i thought it was a 2d minecraft now that ive logged over 150 hours into it i see that terraria is so much more than minecraft when i tried to figure out what was better i made a list hopefully i can do this right exploration terraria 2d sidescrolling multitude of biomes to explorearound 38 you can find loot and ore without even going underground minecraft 3d world multitude of biomes to explorearound 61 you can find loot and bars or metal above ground as well minecraft wins spelunkingminingunderground exploration terraria 13 ores plus an additional 4 ores once in hardmode generated caves as well as other aspects of underground like abandoned mineshafts houses temples etc you can dig straight down to hell minecraft 7 ores generated caves ravines mineshafts 3 strongholds and monster spawners you can grind for obsidian make a portal and set it on fire to go to hell terrria wins craftingnot including weaponsarmor terraria using around 38 crafting stationsincluding honeylava and water you can craft anything if you dont know what an item requires you can ask the guide npc for helpsee npc in laymans terms you can make blocks walls potions accesories tools torches boss spawnerssee fighting dyes grapple hooks and pets and decorationsincluding pots beds etc minecraft using 2 interfaces a player can craft some stuff they want tobeing forced to grind for the rest if you dont know how to arrange the items on a grid you can look it up on the wiki in laymans terms you can make blocks crafting stations torches tools and decorations including pots and beds terraria wins fighting terraria there are 392 enemies in terraria including the bosses there are 18 bosses in terrariathe celestial towers were each counted separetly you can make 15 sets of weapons and armor from the ores aforementioned allowing any play style there are guns bows staves swords sythes summoner staves magic guns yoyos spears chain weapons and tomes minecraft there are 12 enemies in minecraft including the bosses there are 2 bosses in minecraft you can make 4 sets of armor with 1 of them being leather and not metal you can make a bow and 5 swords terraria wins npcs terraria there are 22 npcs in terraria 19 of which will move in if you build them a house you can sell or buy from npcs and many attack enemies that are in the vicinity minecraft there is 1 npc in minecraftjust getting reskinned a bunch to look like more you can exchange goods in very 1 sided tradesyoure gettin swindled terraria wins in the end terraria4 minecraft1 i cant believe you took the time to read all thisdid you thanks for listening to my opinion and buy this game,1,1
105600,Terraria,the best casual sandbox game out there other popular games just fail to stand up to what terraria has become,1,1
105600,Terraria,this review applies to terraria 1308 and earlier the essence of terraria is that it prioritizes fun its not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools the game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement grinding is an option not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time besides there is much to discover and do in the game clocking in at 1000 hours having all 88 achievements and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that with that being said ill list some proscons ive found memorable pros customization there is a staggering amount of customization available ingame you not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors costumes accessories and pets for your character you can also colordye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects dyes arent consumable so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage exploration the terraria world may be finite but it is incredibly diverse each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements it takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything and thats only with absurd luck see the creation of the guide painting the game additionally has an impressive number of flavor that rubble on the ground can be dug up and a worm might pop out from it you can reignite the burntout campfire in that small cavern you didnt think that npcs could fend for themselves during a blood moon or invasion did you just when you think youve learned everything about the terraria world you discover something surprising creativity terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics but they also introduce some neat mechanics players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors terraria features innovative design at its finest progression options like any good rpg theres a great sense of progress made in a playthrough you mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained even the achievements flow nicely never feeling too easy cheap or absurdly difficult you never need to rely crutch items to make progress rather in my experience my friends and i frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot there is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive balance a game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game there is no bottleneck or singular infinity1 sword needed for progress diversity terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player and that claim certainly has truth in it the game has gameplay suited for battlers explorers and builders and i can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct play with only meleerangedmagicsummoning weapons sure a yoyo only run thats popular no craftingmining certainly play the entire game upsidedown of courseand thats bugfree if thats not enough you can fire up a world in expert mode for the extra challenge theres something for everyone ive had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough can i do in the game and i could answer in the positive the majority of the time just for starters you can teleport build trapfilled dungeons set up pvp minigames and record the soundtrack the games breadth is incredible automation terraria would be daunting without any form of automation you have thousands of items hundreds of monsters dozens of mechanics and an expansive world to build on or dig through the game offers much to ease the burden of management autoselect picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection the smart cursor allows for oneclick digging quickstacking is much more convenient than depositing items onebyone chestbychest farming is not only feasible but easy making measured builds is simplified with items like the ruler the game naturally provides the player easeofuse tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores performance many games fall off a prospective players wishlist due to system requirements terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites particle effects physics lighting and entity interaction being a 2d game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play cough starbound cough the games requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesnt require a bulky system to run on i was able to run it decently on a 2007 yearold desktop on windows xp with lowend specifications the performance of the game to medium and some lowend systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players on the other hand if you have a highend system go ahead and fire up that color lighting mode and enjoy terraria in its full glory quality of life many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy not only is terraria s gameplay mainly devoid of bugs but it also buffs out these quirks players are separated from worlds allowing for easy singleplayertomultiplayer transfer characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump chests containing items dont explode if you try to harvest them keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes quickstacking skips favorite items you can use the ingame system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds you can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances in general you never feel youre fighting the games controls and interface continued updates it would be very easy for terraria as popular as it is to offer game expansions as paid dlc the developers instead make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game the developercommunity relationship is superb cons new player friendliness the ingame help system is stunted and players can easily become overwhelmed by the evergrowing number of toys in terraria s sandbox many people resort to a guide to help them through the game grinding while the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress several tangents in the game require patience and luck that fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the hallow the last component of a pda could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away at a rate of one quest per ingame day the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4800 minutes 3 13 days to complete without resorting to tricks it can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch yet terraria is not above this issue moddability terraria is extensive enough that it doesnt need additional features but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience it would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay,1,1
105600,Terraria,i always thought that terraria was a great game but after 12 patch it became one of my personal favourites this game is a 2d rpgplatformer in randomly generated worlds loot that you can find in game is important but not as much as your skill try it out if you like challenging games with almost endless replayability,1,1
105600,Terraria,sense of the new update the game has lots more to do and yes everyone in my friends knows what minecraft is and some are big fans of the game but this is something that has been talked about wayy to long and needs someone to sit down and tell them the difference if you see anything incorrect from the latest 13 update please comment i read them all mc offensives 5 swords 1 bow 5 armor sets terraria offensives 72 swords 36 bows 32 guns 20 yoyos 25 magic staffs 7 spell books 56 armor sets mc bosses 2 terraria bosses 29 including mobile and console bosses mc enemies 21 terraria enemies 402 mc items around 300not counted potions terraria items 3646 pc and 39 are console only mc potions 13 terraria potions 76 and on top of all this minecraft price 2000 never on sale the last sale was in 2013 i could be wrong on this terraria price 1000 and can be a minimum of 250 on sale but hey heres the main thing the better sandbox is minecraft but the better adventure is terraria,1,1
105600,Terraria,you shouldnt open doors at night or else monsters come in guide gtguide does exactly that 1010 would send guide to live in hell again,1,1
105600,Terraria,alright so ive been playing this game ever since 104 building stuff killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming so its about time i should actually make a review on this game i met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood so wow does this game have a special place in my heart putting my sentimental values in this game aside contentwise this game is practically everything a fantasyloving retro game sandbox adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for see if youre not a fan of any of those kind of games then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather slow gosh theres just so much to love in this game that i dont even know where to begin that is if you give this game a chance i shall warn anyone who isnt a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isnt very intuitive as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever however there is a guide npc so if you do feel lost on what to do you should speak to said npc the controls of this game is pretty basic wasd to move space to jump number keys corresponding to the hotbar click to attack etc but once you got all of that figured out boy is this game one heck of a ride especially if you havent read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game youll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover how many things you can create and conquer i definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner meaning youll get to the fun stuff faster ie the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts,1,1
105600,Terraria,played for 390 hours and still not bored from it infinite10,1,1
105600,Terraria,some would call this a 2d minecraft but it offers much more than that extremely fun to play in about four day long bursts however its best played on a private server with friends as playing solo is boring and slow and playing on a public server is a complete mess,1,0
105600,Terraria,trust me this is not a minecraft ripoff,1,1
105600,Terraria,for me one of the best games i ever played on sale it is 249 that money for 324 hours of gameplay and still not tired of it one of a kind just buy it and get to know it,1,0
105600,Terraria,pros insane amount of content great combat 14 fun and challenging bosses fun servers soundtrack is great updates are bigger then most games expansions good artstyle fishing events cons none final verdict one of the best games ive played lots of fun lots of replayability and a ton of content this game is worth it at any price for the 250 i payed for the game i got an great amount of hours out of it and more for most 60 aaa games 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,why are you even reading these reviews the game is 97 positive that is the review,1,1
105600,Terraria,this by far is the greatest game in the world it was my very first game i purchased and is well worth the money,1,1
105600,Terraria,it feels like everybody is quitting gta v to play terraria right now good game,1,1
105600,Terraria,one of the best games ive played game is really good for anyone who likes fighting building crafting getting burned by lava falling,1,1
105600,Terraria,being a minecraft fan i looked down upon the infamous terraria for quite a long time deemed its existence as a small nuisance whats there not to overlook the controls are obviously goggleeyed alien in comparison to the simple 3droaming fpsness the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the crafting genre seriously these were my first impressions however after 2 hours into the game ive started to notice its sleeping greatness the game is insanely huge in almost every aspect the worlds virtually span in 4 directions there are your typical landscape biomes that include forest jungle desert winter and a few more each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath which are biomes on their own but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds 25 hours into the game and i still havent finished exploring the ground and belowground level worlds the amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense there is any set of decorative combat and building equipment imaginable for starters there are myriads of building brick types alone even the wood has different color depending on the forest type you chose to harvest seriously imagine a device a potion or a house equipment terraria has it there is also a huge variety of monsters bosses although the ones ive managed to fight so far have similar behavior guarded dungeons summoning rituals npcs yes unlike minecraft the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room with material and complexity of your choice and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into also there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects i will never forget our descent to the center of the underground jungle a place that changed our characters forever also the queen bee drops awesome sword if you have something to like about the game already but are in doubt or if you love minecraft as well as oldschool graphics represented here with much more effort and finesse than in most pixelated indie titles of today virtually making it snesgrade in terms of quality my advice is go for it and you will inevitably love it just be sure to invite some friends i play with just one but it is already one of if not the best multiplayer experiences ive had in years,1,0
105600,Terraria,before you read this is not like minecraft these are the only similarities they both have mining and exploration they both have zombies to fight they both have bosses they both have hell an underworld thats all i can think of at the top of my head now let me tell you about terrarias advantages it has 13 i think bosses unlike minecraft only has 3 i think it has tons and tons of enemies it has over 3000 items and weopons it has heaven and hell its caves are more fun to explore and easier to find now terraria isnt all good in some peoples eyes in someways like its 2d i dont find it a problem its too confusing or boring again i dont find it confusing nor boring its a copy of minecraft no it isnt btw so i hope you like my review and i encouraged you to buy it add me if you need a partner for coop gameplay new characters edit by arachnid14 1 terraria has over 3900 items 2 they both have some form of electricitycircuit building 3 both are blocks duh 4 terraria is cheaper to buy and goes on sale occasionally 5 2d is good since minecraft is already doing 3d and it would be kinda boring for the games to look so much alike 6terraria has like 12 pets 7 minecraft has a useful pet 8 terraria makes light come from you when your holding a torch,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg the game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time while some say the game is a ripoff of minecraft it is imo rather a testement to what minecraft could have been the game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items the game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while minecraft does the opposite while the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isnt the point of the game the point of the game is fighting the boss progressing to the next level and getting to and beating the inevitable hard mode this focus does mean that the game eventually like all rpgs dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items it is an issue experienced by even mmorpgs such as world of warcraft terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates expansions if you wil to warrent continous playing from update to update the bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight the caves are fun to explore etc everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike minecrafts seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your terraria world this is sad as some things such as pyramids ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome this issue is actually an odd one as all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world the act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will have to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion another issue the game struggles with is online play unlike games such as diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength this makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be and while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter this means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of preplanning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gangbang the boss until it stops moving and drops its loot the various classes magic melee ranged etc are fairly balenced with melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage in and so on in standard rpg fashion while the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a few friends so as to keep the game challenging defining your character mineing and crafting your weapons and armor building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends i rate the game in its current state a 8310,1,1
105600,Terraria,never puts out any dlc doubles the games content in a patch again seriously though relogic doesnt get nearly enough credit for their work,1,1
105600,Terraria,before you read terraria is not a copy of minecraft in my opinion minecraft is a fun and really good game for building but i stopped playing it of boredom a couple months after getting it i did not play it every day now terraria is good for building exploring fighting destroying and is rewarding minecraft is very unforgiving when you die you lose all your stuff and you usually cant get it back in time in terraria you can choose to only drop your money its easy to get it back you can choose to lose some of your items or you can make your character die forever so you need to make a new one i have been playing terraria for 150 hours and i am still not bored of it the slightest bit also if you still think it is a stupid ripoff of minecraft i am fine with that but notice terraria has 14 bosses in pc minecraft has 3 thanks for telling me thedragonborn03 terraria has 70 swords and 50 armor sets while minecraft has less than 10 of both of those i hope this review helped you chose wether to buy this game or not and thank you for reading this far so in my opinion minecraft is the superior for building and has almost endless worlds horizontally terraria is the superior for fighting exploring and looting it is also very addictive and it is hard to pull yourself away from it honestly i get on terraria for multiple hours a day and i get on it every day also the bosses are hard especially during expert or hardmode and they give you a sense of achievment when you beat them just noticed that i am comparing not reviewing well heres a bit of a review terraria is fun and when you kill a boss they drop some pretty useful items and there is really progress because as a beginner stuff like crimtane and shadow scales and demonite and tissue are pretty good when you advance that stuff is considered garbage killing the eye of cthulu is challenging until you kill the wall of flesh or some others once you kill the wall of flesh for some reason cough progress cough all nonhardmode bosses become easy byyyyeeee,1,1
105600,Terraria,oddly enough terraria was the first game id bought on steam i had been away from pc gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on sa and started pestering me to play the buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with its retro chic graphics but i figured if said friend was so fired up about it i might as well give it ago all of the praise i could find at the time compared it to minecraft so i was a bit leary id watched my kid play hours of minecraft and it just wasnt my bag im glad i was able to push that stigma aside because i ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time weve all been kids kids love to explore exploration is the foundation of terraria you start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map then youre left with simply trying to figure out whats there start to dig maybe build a house and youre off and running theres something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth digging a path ever deeper it may seem pointless but as you tunnel down maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you dig some more perhaps you find an underground lake maybe after a few hours of digging you find something far more sinister then you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you and now youre working in conjunction worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny coupled with the thrill of shouting ooh look what i found and getting them to come see terrarias not flashy but it doesnt need to be its a relaxing good time and itll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring,1,0
105600,Terraria,this is probably one of the best games here on steam i first bought this game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times i didnt touch it for a while however after playing it with a friend i discovered what a gem it really is terraria is a 2d adventure survival crafting game that is just perfect in every way it also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building thank you for the smart cursor amp moving around the world thank you for the different mounts alot easier terraria is so cheap but you can spend so much time on it it basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100 the only grinding bit will be the fishing quests youll need to do there is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem you just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10 which is already really cheap for this kind of game then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there now this game might not have the best graphics but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldnt be in any other way i highly recommend this game to any minecraft metroidvania amp 100 achievement fan but even if you are not one of those the chances that you will dislike this game are very low so just give it a shot,1,1
105600,Terraria,ive barely progressed past the wall of flesh and into the next difficulty mode and ive stretched this game out over 1000 hours already and counting although admittedly quite a bit of afk farming has taken place its still receiving content updates and at this specific period of time years after release theyre rather constant all for 249 yes please i remember buying diablo 3 collectors edition for 100 and later feeling ripped off at how big of a piece of that turned out to be and having people on forums try and tell me name another game you pay less than 60100 for and get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of as if quality games that dont your wallet are actually hard to find this is one of them s,1,1

105600,Terraria,i sank 2000 hours broke that mark on november eighth 2016 into this game and not reviewing for several reasons waiting it out for new content borderline laziness and more borderline laziness this game is appealing to everyone unless you are a 6 year old cod squeaker who is physically incapable of understanding fun builders check explorers check people who like blowing stuff up double check get this game now you wont regret it and another thing to add unlike a lot of other games terraria is just incredible by itself ive modded it but had a hard time sinking in as much time as i did in the vanilla game,1,1
105600,Terraria,i put 1272 hours in this game since ver10 was released 5 years ago so its doing something right,1,1

105600,Terraria,i have built a tower of slime wearing a wedding dress i have roasted marshmallows on a campfire on top of a cloud i have bought yoyo materials from a skeleton underground i have destroyed a monster in hell with a laser pistol i have stolen keys from slimes and taken their guns from chests in a dungeon i have made a nurse move into a dirt house in the sky i have used balloons for extra jumps to avoid murderous unicorns i have fought martians while riding a giant rabbit firing blessed arrows from a bow made of fire i havent stopped having fun and i do not expect to stop any time soon,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria can be either very simple or very complex its a very very fun game no seriously buy it now you will not regret it,1,0
105600,Terraria,this game is a minecraft clone a suckup minecraft fanboyfangirl may 16 2011present the only reason they claim its a clone is because its open world and has a few similar weapons which technically a lot of games have swords and minecraft wasnt the first but overall the unmodded version of terraria is actually better than most modded minecraft games in my eyes some people complain that this game doesnt have enough content or doesnt get updated enough and then claim that minecraft is better even though minecraft only has at most 14th of the amout of items terraria contains minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game there are only a few things i find extraordinary in minecraft creepers anything involving the nether anything involving the end and anything involving the mushroom islands the list is so much bigger for terraria there are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semioriginal or 100 original in fact the only thing i wish terraria had that minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators this game isnt even endless like minecraft claims and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years i strongly reccomend this game if you cant already tell this game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games lots of items the developers stay in touch with the community and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like 00 wow,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria is a small 2d adventure game i will review the game in some paragraphs and then i will give it 110 points gameplay in the beggining your quest its to find wood and make a shelter to survive the first night the first nightthat was the longest nigh in terraria for me then the game starts getting harder and harder there are zombies slimes skeletones bosses and many many other creatures its very interesting game 1010 crafting ahthe crafting system in this game is quet hard to solveit was hard to me i didnt know even how to make a torch the coolest thing about the crafting system is that you only need the items for the thing you want to craft not like in minecraft where you need to put every material in some speacial position if youre a new player talk to the first person you see in the game just do it 910 it was hard bosses this is the coolest part of the game beating the bosses so the bosses are made on 2 difficults easy and hard if you fight on easy difficult dont worry the bosses have like 2k hp to 10k hp they can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons if you are a new player dont start with the hardmode just dont on hard mode the bosses are very hard and if you die you lose the game ex the eye of cthulhu its on 28k hp on easy but on hard mode the eyes are two and their name is the twins the one have 20k the other 23k hp good luck 1110 multiplayer oh my god this is the game i can play with friends forever its very funny and when you and the crew get all on hardmode characters and start beating bosses its cool the worstest thig is that terraria is made on small medium and large terrain this is the worstest thing not like in minecraft to be infinite but its aight 8510 can be better final review terraria is a very good game even better than minecraft lol so buy it whatre ya waiting for this is an big adventure in a small world which can be played with friends what more do you need 9510 i highly recommend this game sorry for my bad english,1,1
105600,Terraria,i never expected this game to be as complex as it is at first i checked it out and was like yeah this looks kinda like minecraft in 2d and i got into exploring the world finding items and quickly realized there is way more than i expected in the beginning farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow but once i looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps i was hooked for it i built myself a base gathered more npcs crafted better weapons armor and fought the first bosses i died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun i convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime do i recommend this game yes absolutely if you dont mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you ps there are some pretty amazing items inthe game if you get far enough d,1,1

last coin on minishark only for it to have the shameful modifier spend the very last coin on reforging oh god please let it be good reforges to zealous5 critical strike chance ill take it now feeling confident about wall of flesh spend like a week building a bridge across hell spend another week searching left and right for a voodoo demon none to be found but they seemed abundant back when they

kill them with 10hp remaining get finished off by eater of souls time to mine after about a month of mining and 347 more deaths from these newfangled hardmode enemies youre geared up with adamantite and also have some mechanical wormseyesskulls the destroyer the twins skeletron prime ahhhh theyre nothin against my adamantite summon all three well that was a mistake figure out what you need for the destroyer fetid baghnahks spend hours creating new world after new world praying that the next one will be crimson finally create crimson mimics wchests amp dark keys get pummelled by that beast after getting like 9 tendon hooks fetid baghnahks finally drop time for justice destroyer destroyer gets destroyedthose baghnahks are just unfair of course you get cocky and take on the twins on the same night lets just say it doesnt go too well you feel the innermost depths of your mind starting to decaynahhh its probably nothing time for the megashark drown while getting clobbered by sharks at the same time at the expense of patience and a little bit more of your sanity the hybrid sharkgun is complete at last finally time for those eyes to go blind realize that musket balls are in fact not effective vs hardmode bosses realize that youve erred once again realize that youre now dead in the game and on the inside do battle once again this time for realsies twins defeated time to spend

and again etc and ive reached the character limit congratulations to those who read all the way through my giant string of stupid thoughts from the top down to here my final climactic verdict on the game well look no further 1310 would waste 20 full days 500hours of my life kill 14 of my brain cells die inside and lose contact with reality again,1,1
105600,Terraria,as they said nothing is impossible but you cant destroy dirt with axe 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria looks basic at first but there is an entirely confusing and complex world under the surface,1,1
105600,Terraria,everytime you go mining a bat will knock you into lava everytime you build a house a bat will knock you into lava everytme you try and do anything productive the ing bats will knock you into ing lava 1010 would rage quit again,1,0
105600,Terraria,i used to play minecraft and nothing else but now that i have found terraria i never touch mc i love sandbox games but this has sooo many things in it your options are even more endless than before it also never lags one of my pet peeves i espessially love all of the machines and bosses this is a true sandbox game thank you terraria,1,1
105600,Terraria,i can hold 49950 bunnies in my pocket,1,1
105600,Terraria,i myself enjoy building mining and open ended games this is something different though it combines the adventurous feeling of path of exile and the 2d yet amazing type of art of starbound and edge of space this came as a gift from my brother he noticed that i was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and i didnt have it so he spent his own money or steam credit to buy me this game it is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment thanks bro many people would call this 2d minecraft and pointless silly and plain rubbish i however disagree as this game has more enemies bosses items biomes and many more this game is out on many platforms and i simply love this game 9510 i would like to give my thanks to relogic and the rest of the group for this game it is astoundingly beautiful i shall now talk about the gameplay you may customize your characters original look and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh allow double jump save you from from injuries by dodging etc you also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style you have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items too you can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat i personally collect hats as a hobby so i could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm the multiplayer allows pvp and its own version of ctf capture the gem it also has teams allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other this game has a wide range of npcs ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl the nurse can be a bit rude though but i dont care she gets the job done you can build a condo by the ocean or a mansion in the roots of a tree you can hollow out hell or reside in the clouds you could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool the crafting is fun you can make potions easier than in minecraft and the traders dont go hmmm that is an automatic upgradei just love this game and if anybody says that it is bad then i have a tear run down my cheek just joking i would like to thank redigit dtown cenx crowno will aaron jim and anybody else who helped make this game i have changed my rating from earlier 1010 terraria has a lot of potential yet is still a fantastic game anyway you look at it it is full of colour and beauty thanks this is a true game,1,1
105600,Terraria,i sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time its like a christmas morning putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time terraria is this sort of game starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure but the experience of stepping into that bright twodimensional world for the first time and discovering piecebypiece all that it has hidden is worth the asking price all by itself subsequent playthroughs only add to the value and how and if its on sale it is often i can only advise you not to hesitate terraria is a very versatile game you can play for hours at a time clocking up days worth of play and still have a todo list as long as a bone serpent alternatively you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you building a little here digging a little there working on some great artifice a bit at a time you can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals or simply make a treehouse for all your npc friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting become an arctic explorer go fishing drain the ocean into the dungeon i have actually done this it was hard work but good fun go to hell literally you can try to be bored but it will take a lot of effort one of the advantages terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team when updates come and they may not come forever they add great stores of content to the game with new npcs items mechanics enemies and locations not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced no small feat given that every change has to keep terraria accessible to new players whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean this is all done remarkably well the devs maintain a good community and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives without ever compromising the creative vision behind it in an age of cowboy developers corporate spin and microtransactions on every street corner terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games and if i needed to buy it again i would quite happily pay the full price although as i said sales do happen of course nothing is perfect and nothing is for everyone when it comes to armour and weapons and things forged out of fantastically rare ores it can be very grindy if thats a word building anything of any real size takes time as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace boss fights can take a lot of preparation and the laterstage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly as a rule i find that terraria is very good at compensating for these issues a quick trip to collect wood for housebuilding can turn into a hectic race through zombieinfested tundra or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm but not everyone will want to give it their time a mere two dimensions may be a dealbreaker for some not to mention the rather oldschool pixely art style but even if this sounds like you i recommend giving it a try for me terraria worked where minecraft didnt and i still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter so give it a go walk around that forest for the first time dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you if it does keep digging after one year and 262 hours of play i still havent stopped,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria the best sandbox game on steam well that is obviously my opinion and to me it holds true the first thing you should realise about terraria is that there is no real story to the game besides collecting resources building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that terraria has to offer and oh boy does it have monsters i think the best place to start this review would be talking about what i love about the game and what i sometimes wish was worked on a little bit firstly what i really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment and i dont mean accomplishment as in congrats you killed a single enemy heres 100 great items and 20 achievements i mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which youve been grinding for will expand on this point later which gives you a good item now once again when i say a good item i in no way mean game winning or game breaking items i mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues now as i said earlier about grinding yes this game does have grinding in it however i deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an rpg first and foremost yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest however you must not worry if you choose to grind alot which i know most people will choose to do you will get better gear however if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you youll still get good stuff stuff that will help you defeat the next boss so to sum that up let me put it like this this game doesnt require you to grind just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle speaking of bosses this game has multiple 14 to be exact all of which are unique im going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that youll be seeing early on in the game those 3 bosses are eye of cthulu the eater of worlds the brain of cthulu on crimson worlds and skeletron each of these bosses are very unique now whilst i dont want to spoil these bosses i think the best way to describe them is like this eye of cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt the eater of worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys its segments each dropping loot the brain of cthulu is a giant brain suprisingly it spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself and finally skeletron skeletron is a monstrous skeleton with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier what i really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other end game bosses are equally amazing but may require a giant wall to be passed could cause a lot of flesh wounds if you catch my drift endhardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game enough about the bosses lets talk about weaponry theres a multitude of weapon types to choose from melee ranged mage and summoner and the amount of weapons within each catagory is well its insane to be quite honest with you if youre not enjoy swords why dont you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes this game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from and with that you also get the different armour types to help you once again armour comes in a multitude range melee ranged mage and summoner now some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that ranged is mostly bows guns and all the things like that mage is staffs books of magic and guff like that now summoner is where people probably dont understand what it is summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight like slimes ravens and pygmys finally where this game kinda falls short i mean its nothing 100 game ruining achievements okay okay lower the pitchforks allow me to explain myself i love the achievements in this game theyre fun rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game but some of them are just so damn grindy i mean i think if youve played this game you understand where im going with this the god damn angler missons i dont want to spend my time fishing when i could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time i dont want to fish its not as if its just 5 or 10 times its 250 times i dont want to fish for that long look this game is damn near perfect and theres no way i can deny that the constant work the devs put in is astounding and i must say that its amazing the time and dedication they put into it and well it paid off this review is simply a slither of what the game is and with that i bid you all goodbye and farewell i hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone enjoy the review please consider checking out my curator i recommend many games similar to this one httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsjacksgamesofchoicecuration,1,1
105600,Terraria,holy hell what a ride this has been i first recieved this game when i was selected as the winner of a giveaway i thought whatever ive played minecraft this game is probably the exact same as it after all there are certain similarities between both games find yourself stranded in the wilderness mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win but the similarities end exactly there now this game in the starting phase is actually quite bland and i nearly quit because of it at first but with the help of some friends i stuck with it it was pretty generic stuff mine some boring ores build a boring house feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon or dying and dropping your money youll die quite a bit as well but dont let that discourage you the moment i realized the exact depth of the game and realized iactually loved this game was the moment my friends and i summoned what is to be considered the first boss the eye of cthulu the intensity of the battle especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor hint armor is your best friend made victory all the more satisfying the adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses minecraft in its entertainment value yet i believed that was all the game had to offer that one bit of awesomeness wrong excluding event bosses there are over 14 different and unique bosses of terraria each with their own unique powers and in expert mode their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack from the eye of cthulus blinding fast rushes to the skeletrons deadly skull spin no two bosses are the same nor can they be approached in the same way nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building but thats not all because you know whats better than killing a boss sweet sweet loot emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better from shields that allow for bashlike charging to a scarf that reduces damage by 17 every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot now about now is where you can pick your specialization especially if youre playing with friends will you be the hulking tank absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates or the looming mage casting deadly spells from behind or an archer raining down death from above it doesnt matter after all in terraria youre free to do what you want and right when you think things are getting bland again hardmode hits you all of your weapons and armors effectiveness is quartered enemies are a challenge again venturing out at night is a near death sentence new enemies will spawn and new loot along with it but again dont be discouraged youll die quite a bit after all build your strength up again and go kick some,1,1
105600,Terraria,this was the first game i ever bought on steam five years later im still playing it and enjoying the hell out of it thanks redigit,1,1
105600,Terraria,fun fact its possible to like both minecraft and terraria,1,1
105600,Terraria,the most used comparison for this game is terrariaminecraft i shall explain the difference between minecraft and terraria edit terraria is better exploration minecraft 3d world practically limitless several biomes intresting underground areas terraria 2d world you can control the size several biomes deeper underground areas underground hosts greater and cooler enemies treasures cave systems etc building minecraft limited supply of blocks blocks take up lots of space the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily terraria hundreds and hundreds of blocks blocks stack into higher quantities m64 t999 blocks are easier to get combat minecraft 3 bosses 5 swords and a bow 5 types of armor not much variety for pvp it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon terraria 29 bosses swords ranging from shortswords to nyancat projectile swords ranged weapons magic summoner weapons etc pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability so terraria has more good points then bad when compared to minecraft so there shut up about this game being a rip off you minecraftfnaffanboyswhowillrisetoprotectthebestgamesofalltime,1,1
105600,Terraria,i was digging and a spooky skeleton sent shivers down my spine absolutely 1010 game especially with friends if youre a fan of sandbox games this ones for you but it still needs spook alerts,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria is a 2d sandbox adventure game thats all about building and fighting giant monsters sounds like another popular game right i assure you its nothing like it in terraria you are the player a custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace not to say that the game doesnt have its fair share of building aswell the combat is sort of simple yet charming i always love going on expert mode with my endgame character and fighting a bunch of bosses its always good fun and while i may not be the best at building i enjoy it too terraria has to be my favorite game of alltime period just throw 10 usd at the screen to get it seriously its dirt cheap if i missed anything in this review dont tell me go make your own review im sure you can make something thats much better than what i can do whats that you already own the game well what the hell are you doing here go play it,1,1
105600,Terraria,bad game no content 800hrs10 would spend years playing again srs tiem 2d platformer with a strong emphasis on crafting and character progression almost infinite replayability amazing coop challenging bosses beautiful soundtrack recently updatedcurrently supported loads of achievements i honestly couldnt recommend this game more better than minecraft paved the way for starbound referenced in many other titles buy the damned game already,1,1
105600,Terraria,you can nuke waves of zombies with explosives bunnies you can pelt santa claus to death with rotten eggs you can murder enemies with bananas you have to sacrifice your guide to the gods of hell to progress the game and one of the bosses is a pig shark dragon walrus mutant named duke fishron play it already,1,1
105600,Terraria,my seconds minutes hours and days are terraria i lost my husband my kids my entire life to this game play it worth,1,1
105600,Terraria,one of the most content filled games i have ever played absolutely recommend as a game that you can sink hours into and always have something to do,1,1
105600,Terraria,edit 6302015 steam multiplayer has now been added when i first saw this game i thought of it as another minecraft clone now that i played about 100 hours on record i now know it isnt a clone of minecraft it is better than minecraft in my opinion its a 2d adventure game with alot of bosses and crafting one thing i dont like about it the steam multiplayer in most games steam allows you to play with other people using steam in terraria you have to host your own server at the end of the day terraria is a great game and i recommend it 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,introduction terraria is a 2d sandbox game with elements of action mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell with the choice to build mine fish explore fight and ride unicorns how you play the game is really up to you pros customisable characters with cloud support dozens of weapons armour equipment tools and consumables to choose from various mounts and pets to choose from multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants resource and behaviour over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers interesting npcs who appreciate your horrible houses more than one way to play the game such as fishing mining and dying hundreds of craftable items and dozens of blocks cons very timeconsuming although some see this as a good thing overall terraria is not a ripoff of minecraft but is actually a phenomenal game packed with fun and a lot of content it is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend even after beating the final boss there are still lots to explore discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game i personally rate this game a 910,1,1
105600,Terraria,this game is like a time machine only that you can only go foward for example start playing at 8 pm blink now its 4 am see magic i would rate this my time played10,1,1
105600,Terraria,i remember started to play a bit more games than just css and cs 16 my brother had found this new awesome game that could be a potential minecraft but for slower pcs and with a hell lot more content back in 2011 you had to hammer crystals you had to use a wooden axe to cut wood blocks not a pickaxe you couldnt get past a 1block tile withouth jumping background was ugly so was the sun rocket boots needed mana liquids were buggy so were walls there was no expert mode the twins were awfully hard so was the destroyer star cannon was op making a bridge to fight wof was tedious i had pirated this game ill admit that but even then even with those annoying things even with the sluggish gameplay it had it was one of my best times of my childhood and the most fun ive ever had with a game so beautiful seeing it develop like a great indie game deserves thank you redigit youve made my childhood brighter,1,1
105600,Terraria,what is terraria terraria was a game that often mistaken as a minecraft clone and often seen as 2d minecraft even after all that nonsense terraria was still a unique and a very young 2d adventure game that dragged many players into its world after 12 update terraria became even larger selling millions of copies but then just after 121 it began to slowly die off fans were crying for it not until something wonderful happened terraria was released on consoles slightly extending its life and then there were rumors about a big update for terraria on pc the 13 update was litteraly an explosion of new content and yes its true 1000 items were added into game this has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history free updates are still coming adding more and more content together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun if isnt obvious by now terraria is much better than minecraft in all aspects dont get me wrong minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too but minecraft alone will be never as good as terraria currently is so what does terraira feature that makes it such a great game lets start from what you can do in terraira fight from smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe you will learn in a hard way how dangerous the lands of terraira really are you are nowhere safe not even inside your own home as during certain events swarms of enemies will break into your house attempting to turn you and your fellow npcs into a pile of mangled corpses hell even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness if you havent defeated them yet even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies your world is still in danger there are biomes seen as evil that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world you are only one who can prevent this so you better get a move on you will come across thousands of enemies as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them there are so many weapons to choose from that everytime you start from beggining you will find different set of weapons and armor to use this is what makes replayability in terraria great from weapons you have swords that are ten times larger than your character swords that shoot swords bow that makes arrows rain from sky large variety of machineguns launchers pistols laser weaponary craziest magical items youll ever see lots and lots of ammo types and much much more once you got yourself a good gear its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating gain their loot and progress deeper in world of terraria eventually unlocking the hardmode in your world where real adventure begins and where only real heroes your characters shall become champions of terraria build hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there most of blocks have their own theme eg marble represents acient greeks as well as their own set of furniture such as bathtubs tables bookshelfs lamps etc some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items once you got everything you need its up to you what you want to build a house made entirely out of bones slime glass honey or make it steampunk themed alien themed have golden toilets garden full of large glowing mushrooms color shitfting blocks beds made out of flesh i can go forever like this the options are truly endless you can even shape blocks with hammers andor color them build traps with wiring system wall tappets decorations paintings remember you world is your canvas you can get npcs to live inside your marvelious creations and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful oh and also you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground these blocks are made for pixel art explore a small world of terraira contains everything you need but just imagine what large worlds offers all you have to do is explore them you will find large variety of awesome loot accesories and weapons for your character to use statues to collect and most importantly ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health but beware as i said nowhere is safe underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches if you have hard time exploring the underground try fishing with fishing you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground all you need here is bait good fishing rod patience and with enough luck you will be swinging fishswords and sharkpickaxes at your foes collect collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun being able to own everything that exists in terraria is satifaction at its best if you like collecting stuff you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again just to get that one item that you dont own only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again or a throphy to decorate your walls with ah lovely customize in order to customize your character in a way you really want it needs a lot of effort you will need to fight and explore a lot as well as get npcs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them terraria also features social slots with these slots you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives incase you find one armor likeable but you dont want to wear it because you already own a better armor just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it and your actual better armor will still provide you its perks and abilities social slots are made for cosmetic purposes you can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors as well as using hair dyes for hair theres an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft as well as rare dyes that glow have animations reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects should you buy this game why of course its worth every single copper coin and has multiplayer too which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddybuddies to play with it has holiday events during halloween and christmass where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events i gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that terraria can offer well will you,1,1
105600,Terraria,if this game was a potato it would be a good one,1,0

105600,Terraria,better than minecraft,1,1
105600,Terraria,day 1 gets sad copper pickaxe zealous copper shortword and some other tool spawns next to some guide named scott scott falls into a mine gets trapped tries to mine tree takes really long time starts getting assaulted by green slimes freaks out tries attacking with shortsword barely does anything eventually kills it finally mines tree builds square out of wood with door calls it home uses spare wood to make crafting bench night 1 sits in house in fear zombies and flying eyes trying to break in guide mauled by zombies waits until daytime opens door is killed by zombies 1110 over 3600 items and infinite gameplay possibilities can wear a fursuit rainbow guns and rainbow biomes buy it right now,1,1
105600,Terraria,you can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,im going to be honest at first i hated this game i mean absolutely despised it but believe me when i started crafting better gear fighting new mobs and building my home i became immersed in terraria theres an endless amount of content here for only 999 and if you were like me thinking this was just a 2d minecraft ripoff you couldnt be more wrong definitely a must play and yes like always the pc version is far superior of the console versions,1,1
105600,Terraria,probably best 2d sandbox ever made the amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat including bosses is just sometimes overwhelming the game has 2 stages 1 prehardmode basically a longer tutorial where you learn basics such as crafting fighting monsters and exploring biomes this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh 2 hardmode the real game begins here monsters are stronger and new biomes appear a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode this stage remains forever or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it there are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders wont be dissapointed though i was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building highly recommend this game but be careful its addictive,1,1
105600,Terraria,so i started a world got wood built a house guide moved in told him to get lost didnt listen swore id kill him for it 10 hours passed got guide voodoo doll built platform killed wall of flesh guide thought it was over my house was now hallow got butt stabbed by a unicorn quit reloaded in saw pixies killed pixies didnt know wtf to do destroyed demonic things got souls got good weapons defeated moon lord 1010 would do it again,1,1
105600,Terraria,i have had a really good experience with this game and its been fun had to edit this since there were some points that i forgot to make pros good for passing time by has a lot of things you can do if you want to get into wiring you can do some awesome stuff the devs are pretty nice its fun with friends or alone pixle art and you can always mod it when you get bored of the base game cons you might get tired of the soundtrack pretty quickly but you can always put on something else,1,1
105600,Terraria,well i think its about time to review this gem terraria is one of the best valueperdollar games you can buy on steam period obviously some of the freetoplay games can match that value because you spend nothing but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous ever since 10 there have been 3 absolutely gamechanging updates for completely free the game was already worth it just at 10 apart from bugs but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game 10 got the basics right satisfying combat fun exploration lots of sandboxy things to do but as i just said its sandboxy theres a lack of an appropriate ending besides get the most powerful stuff 13 gave us the moon lord which is the equivilant of the ender dragon from minecraft it doesnt end your game after you defeat it but its something tough even with the gear you get from him so it feels like a climactic end youll start off small with your copper shortsword or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it after many hours youll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you from bows to guns to magic and from simple take less damage armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends on top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding theres so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun on top of those cosmetic things you also have the as of a recent update fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or openingclosing doors and on top of that you have the massive variety of enemies to fight some of which will completely obliterate you and youll enjoy every minute of it all of the bosses have their unique elements and youll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out like the first time that the corruption boss comes out of the ground and on top of that you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesnt have enough content whether you just want more content or complete overhauls the modding communitys got you covered in userfriendly mod managers and easy mod installation so basically im saying the games pretty good and you should buy it if you havent already with how often it goes on 50 and 75 sales edit also you guys should totally nominate this game for the test of time reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and its one of those games that pretty much every person on steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out,1,1
105600,Terraria,better than starbound,1,1
105600,Terraria,a great game but a tough start i didnt really like it in the beginning but it turned out to be amazing,1,0
105600,Terraria,step 1 go into caves step 2 kill stuff step 3 get better armor amp weapons step 4 kill bigger stuff step 5 repeat step 3 and 4 indefinitely on the serious note terraria is a phenomenal game amp you should give it a try,1,1
105600,Terraria,first world i got headaches from mining sounds i had no idea what i was doing i thought i was super op with copper armor 1010 would be a noob again second world used youtube videos as guides got to hardmode got adamantite armor didnt beat any of the metal bosses 1010 would travel back in time to finish what i had started third world had a friend with me we cheated 1010 would cheat again fourth world i again played with the friend we had another friend join us we cheated even more my friends blew up everything i got really paranoid of everything so i saved the world constantly 1010 would be paranoid again fifth world played with another friend why do so many zombies have hands that was freaking sand i got the meowmere the game crashed so i lost the meowmere 1010 would farm the moon lord again 1010 this game made me insane,1,1
105600,Terraria,2d minecraft it is a thought almost everyone has had and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves but terraria is much more than just that and here is why i recommend it terrarias world is literally designed as a terrarium you start somewhere towards the middle of your world and whether you go left or right you will eventually stumble into an ocean with an invisible wall a little ways out you have a couple options build a base and start exploring the surface or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems terrarias surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base or outpost and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them and even sometimes fight the biome itself cure the corruptioncrimson or heck even help it spread be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down additionally there is also the chance of events happening such as the goblin invasion throughout its underground system which can be around 2000 blocks deep you will find minidungeons deep cavern systems and even bosses at times and of course we have a hellish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures and when you think you have done it all defeat the boss in the hellbiome and start a newgame esque event that makes everything in your world harder even the bosses so is terraria recommended hell yes for 10 its been on sale as low as 2 if youre on a budget you will literally get days or weeks worth of gameplay and even more so if you have friends to play with coop always makes games better,1,1
105600,Terraria,massive creative time sink dig like a boss this is one of if not the best values on steam for the amount of time you can play it vs the money you will spend terraria has had two massive updates for free already as well as both a halloween and a christmas update that added many more items enemies events and bosses as well the game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game exploration mining and item collecting is a big part of the game with the 2 major updates and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find get from bosses and simply craft for the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50100 hours searching for all of these alone you can find and craft armors melee weapons ranged weapons and magic weapons you will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others you can plant gardens for potion ingretients find special keys to unlock more chests banners paintings statues etc for decoration you can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks boss fights are for the more action orientated players the game has 2 modes you start in the normal or easymode we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldnt be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons armors and accessories after defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into hardmode this is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear you also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find the real longevity of the game however comes in the crafting and building aspects of terraria after you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores found your gears etc you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures the game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport the building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game not only can you do all of this alone in single player but terraria has coopmultiplayer you can do everything you can in the single player mode but with friends share and trade items with others go and fight bosses together or join together and create a massive art project or city look around the net for terraria artwork there are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the terraria players out there terraria is one of my favorite games i have on steam and is one that every steam gmaer should own the game goes oon sale regularly at 75 off so you can get it for 250 regularly its a steal even at full price also dont forget to check out terraria online for the wiki and the modding community this game has a very nice and active mod community so even after all of this you can still get mods too the game also has trading cards,1,0
105600,Terraria,after 177 hrs i will give it a review so i started like make a character make a world kill harmless animals chop some trees down build a house die at night time i thought i was brave enough to face all the monsters die die die die die i felt sad since i couldnt kill any enemies i went mining i died of boulders i was raging i went on to kill more harmless animals i felt guilty i mined more i got good gear and a nice sword i tried facing the monsters at night i killed them all i felt like i was the best i summoned eye of chutulu die die die i killed it after loads of tries i felt even better more mining i got down to the underworld which took hell of a lot of time 3 i melted i was killed because my feet were on fire i got hellstone better stuff killed a ton of prehardmode bosses i hated wall of flesh entered hardmode die die die destroyed altars ghosts wraiths were after me tried to call ghostbusters no response die mined new cool ore better stuff hardmode bosses even better stuff i took down all of the mechs i tried duke fishron die die die die killed him got gud got cool stuff raided jungle dungeon got sniper rifle 360 noscoped a bunny felt mlg tried moonlord die die die die die die i killed him i felt soo gud i tried expert mode i regret that decission a lot welp that is where my story ends hope you will like this cool game,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria the only game on pc where you can solely defeat the final boss using only a yoyo 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,this game is insane value youll easily pick up 1000 hours probably in one sitting because youd be so addicted 1010,1,1
105600,Terraria,when you start playing the game you die a lot then you get better weapons and amor and you still die a lot you build your first house you die a lot defending it this is an adventure an adventure of dying a lot and you love it,1,1
105600,Terraria,you start the game and be like what am i even doing so you dig and build and explore like it was mincraft or something like that then after you find a huge pile of junk and some hearts youll get a message you feel an evil presence watching you and your pants might feel warm because you already know that terraria loves to kill you boss spawns and you might die or youre able to kill him after that youll look at the wiki and realize holy mother of slimes this game has content and that is where your jorney truly begins gear up fight bosses gear up again fight more bosses get killed try again build stuff survive events die to random traps fight moar bosses dig to hell and back get op build on slay random stuff for your amusement farm stuff you dont even need anymore watch all your fellow npcs get slain by the next boss catch fish catch a bigger fish get killed by that bigger fish and so on 910 because it doesnt have infinit content d,1,1
105600,Terraria,its boring and slow at the beginning but after you killed the guide for the first time its great family fun 109,1,1
105600,Terraria,terraria terraria terraria old old terraria i used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server it appears i played almost 140 138 hours of this game and it was pretty darn good terraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie rpg with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is not a minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination no no no to some it could even be better terraria features a huge amount of enemies items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed it also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome first off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason i love the game are the amounts of items there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse lets just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed next off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses from a giant worm to cthulus old eye there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game however terraria still has its flaws and one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why i dont play anymore there is a large amount of grinding involved certain enemies drop certain items skeletons and piranhas used tostill do drop hooks but only skeletons and piranhas and some have very low drop rates again this might have been fixed however that was merely one floor amongst many positives back to the positives one thing i forgot to mention was the housing system whenever you make a compatible house you cant just make a random crevasse and expect it to work you need to create a proper actual house an npc will move in but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the npcs respect such as kill a boss which i think you needed for the dryad there are many many npcs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things especially the nurse who seems to have a crush on the gunslinger but again nothing is done with that dont expect cute guide x dryad crap to happen sorry shippers thatd be cool if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more npcs there is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns theyre all unique and itll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is insane itll take estimated 200 hours and over dont quote me on that to see every little tiny bit of content if not 300 hours but once youre done with that im not sure if youd want to come back to it and finally the combat system its very basic especially melee wise but once you get late into the game youll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items thatll mix everything up and the final verdict for terraria is 65 out of 10 i feel bad for not ranking it higher but the grinding and the fact that its not really my kind of game altogether causes it to be a 6510 which is a great game to me until next review bye,1,1
107410,Arma 3,this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower i was squad leader of 8 or so ais as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about,1,1
107410,Arma 3,oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter as it is so so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning the gameplay is excellent the mechanics are solid and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series as i was may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fpsshooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief brutal and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no minimaps no enemy ui iconsindicators no hit markers no health bars if you get shot a couple of times you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness cover teamwork suppressive fire and generally moving purposefully and as if your depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles armor helicopters and planes each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts each containing 1215 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding and challenging i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete however the singleplayer campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer oh god the multiplayer wasteland king of the hill invade and annex battle royale breaking point so many coop opportunities the amazing looking upcoming epoch currently in closed alpha im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later if you do not find my review helpful please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback,1,1
107410,Arma 3,my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game ever were on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces im leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run my autorifleman runs my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through remember the sniper scene the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here he screams as hes being shot crawling drenched in his own blood sarge you aint leaving me out here like this right ii wanna go with you guys cmon sarge hhelp me cmon please dont leave me he died after that i cried and he respawned 1110 would recommend getting,1,0
107410,Arma 3,i spent several years in the army and i gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides i love how difficult this game is and i love all of the different features the game provides it is not easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life and this game seems to match that same difficulty fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real lifearma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear or you will have a hard time hitting your target enemies are not stupid and they have great vision i was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 35 second rushes when moving the ai is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life haha p given my love for the military and for videogames this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time d,1,1
107410,Arma 3,having accumulated over 13400 hours ingame with arma 3 i would certainly recommend it to others if you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends its well worth a look especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism,1,1
107410,Arma 3,cant tell you if you should buy it or not but i can tell you this you will find annoying bugs highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have but when you really get down to it and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission its something magical you just cant find in any other game arma is not a game which you pick up at launch play the campaign and a bit of mp and then trow away you buy it love it or hate it and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly arma is a game which you can never called finished there will always be added to it be it user or official content fixes features or optimizations hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare this will be your gem ill give it a 910 simply because screw bugs ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back read i will not accept random friend requests if you have a question please post it in the comments,1,1

107410,Arma 3,this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played and its not because of the campaign crowd around children its story time one day not so long ago my squad had just destroyed an antiair battery our pilot landed and the rest of the squad boarded one by one i was about to get in when the rockets started flying the chopper lifted off with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes unwilling to die before then i rushed to the nearest cover a small house by a narrow road i entered to find a ten yearold player who had also been left behind he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan i politely declined explaining that my own squad was inbound as i finished a ghost hawk flew over the horizon my squad had arrived this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting the sniper screamed as a 65 mm cartridge entered his leg his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport my new friend was dead 1010 would experience survivor guilt again,1,0
107410,Arma 3,do not get this game it only caused me to lose all of my free time drop 3k on a machine that can run it on ultra worth every penny the game is so dang beautiful make my grades drop and to lose my social life worth yes note i did not expect for this review to get so many views and comments that being said i want to clairify something people comenting about te price of my setup are both right and wrong i have a dual 1440p setup one monitor for arma and one for misc things arma is very cpu intensive so i am running an i7 5820k 45gz w water cooling as well as a 980ti and multiple ssds in raid 0 the 32 gigs of ddr4 overkill but i got it on sale so why not this is to acheive a minimum of 60fps ultra 1440p at all times even in multiplayer this game is beutiful realistic and has endless possibilities to explore so why dont you give it a shot,1,0
107410,Arma 3,i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 1020 minutes in a single location sometimes longer i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible unless doing paintballing or airgunning and if you do buy the game i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game,1,1

107410,Arma 3,recommending this game is a nobrainer if you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable the game wont let you in easily it has a steep learning curve and starting out can be quite frustrating also you are less likely to find good public servers it hardly is hopon and play like cod or battlefield the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group groups range from runandgun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff so there should be something for everybody bottom line go get it its unique in every aspect,1,1
107410,Arma 3,my first day in arma 3 altis life joined the roleplay server my first day on altis saw a group of heavely armed cool looking dudes so i went to them to say hi i casually walk to them amp say hey guys nice gear the next thing i know is that im being told to put my fucing hands up or i die i do as they say one guy handcuffs me puts me in his car amp then they take me to a very isolated house on top of a hill amp its pitch dark they force me to get naked amp drop all my clothes the other guy shoots me in the knee cap amp then they ride off leaving me bleeding i somehow manage to drag my self to the higway amp this lovely genlteman gives me a lift to the hospital i get my self patchd up go to the nearest gun store buy a rook with a 30rnd mag go to the location where i first saw those faggs luckily they were in the city square not far from where i was went to them shouted eat lead es sprayed my 30 rnds on them killing both of them went to there bleeing bodies amp shot them in the head after i tea bagged them 1110,1,1
107410,Arma 3,the only game ill happily play at 5 fps,1,1
107410,Arma 3,if youre coming to arma 3 as an arma series veteran you already know what to expect for the most part the game hasnt changed since the last installment but then its always felt a little bit like bohemia interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by operation flashpoint in the worlds longest ever game of development buckaroo thankfully the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner its quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now arma has a reputation its known to be frighteningly obtuse bewilderingly complex and often hilariously broken i can tell you right now that arma 3 is no different and absolutely still deserves that reputation thankfully i dont think its unfair to say that this is the closest an arma game has come to being user friendly the controls have been tweaked and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes for these improvements alone i do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry coming from any other modern fps game it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls but i honestly think arma 3 will see a far lower dropout rate of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games at the time of writing the elephant in the room is the lack of content available when compared to arma 2 which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim in many cases opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best for anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in arma 2 arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing fortunately this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community it has long been the case that the best parts of the arma games are the parts not developed by bohemia interactive themselves and arma 3 is most definitely continuing this tradition nevertheless i cant help but feel that the game couldve done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release speaking of the mod community i think its criminal that almost none of the best nearindispensible mods from arma 2 have been officially integrated for a selfprofessed war simulator arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces even with a visible bipod or tow damaged vehicles for all its flaws though arma 3 is still a blast to play if you can find a decent group of likeminded gamers with access to a voiceovernet server youre in for some of the best gaming youll ever experience sure youll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety and sure sometimes the game will crash spectacularly or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall but when youre standing on a hilltop looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a cas helicopter strafes an enemy apc and spots targets for a distant sniper team when everything clicks together in the way that only arma can manage youll be glad to have been along for the ride,1,0

107410,Arma 3,being an avid arma 2 wastelanddayz player back in the day about 15 years ago i relished the thought of a new arma coming out arma 2 was practically uknown until its popularity was increased by dayz i found it interesting to jump into a bi bohemia interactive title that already had a steady fanbase behind it having been about a year since i purchased this game launch and over 100 hours of solid gameplay i feel that i can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects i have experienced within this game now i know what youre thinking 5999 this isnt even considered a triple a title thats like thats like the price of cod ghosts now dont be intimidated by this price for i can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than 5999 from a value perspective i found the price to be very reasonable based on the games content nowadays basically arma is a series of hardcore military simulation constantly reflecting realworld conditions into a video game in arma 2 i feel that this was its drawback for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall its a game guys relax arma 3 has found a good balance between an fps3rd person shooter game and realism making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator and a game i also found that arma 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun i imagine it is much easier to get into arma 3 than i did arma 2 i cant judge im not new to it the engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the arma 2 engine however rocks are still and i guess forever will be broken perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an uneven surface pro tip never walk on rocks unless you absolutely have to the game also has a variety of content although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are a lot less guns this is partly due to the customization of guns instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation m4a1 holo m4a1 cco m4a1 you have a base gun and you are able to add sights lasers silencers flashlights what have you however this is not a full excuse i feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall guns to shoot perhaps bohemia interactive is trying to finetune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for varietys sake whats also very surprisingly good in this game is the nvidia physx that was incorporated seeing my transport trucks wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while i drive troops through the night is ohsosatisfying as well as well realistic the physics engine has been extremely improved and i quite like it id like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound for this is after all a big part of the game once again i will compare it to arma 2 in saying clearly that arma 2 featured a more highpitched tappy sound when you shot with vertical recoil while 3 brings a much more deeper louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards the guns definitely feel better for me but in the end id like to classify this judgment as personal preference lastly the gamemodes of arma 3 are diverse and excellent my favourite being wasteland script i wont go into detail here there is also king of hill dayz of course but its meh and of course standard operations altis life is also a really sweet one check those out if you end up buying so yeah i really like this game and i think that there is so much potential for a growing community grab some buddies hop into stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad really great game id definitely recommend to any fpsmilsim fan d,1,0

107410,Arma 3,arma 3 is a tricky game to review but heres me trying it anyway the reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player i take arma 3 for what it is first and foremost a platform what you get is a good looking game with a solid would be great but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance engine two amazing maps stratis and altis which is probably the most impressive map ive seen in any open worldish game and the prospect of near endless new content from the community what you dont get is an easy to get into milshooter with cod sized maps and a quick pace if youre in for uncomplicated fast paced pvp gameplay you should probably look elsewhere if youre sick of that however arma 3 might be just your thing the strength of the arma series is freedom yeah you are free to mod the game into almost anything you want create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience you have to invest some time into the game but once you got into it the opportunities are endless want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more arma is just your thing and there are big communities in many different languages that will help you find that epic experience want to play singe player well if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on then arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for or is it right now bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign those missions are challenging offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters but as mentioned before the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime personally i prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends already the steam workshop has countless missions for 25 players so should you buy arma 3 well id certainly recommend it if any of the things i mentioned above sounds fun to you it is to say though that this game is not something that everyone might like so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it i hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by arma 3 please note that im not a native english speaker so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some,1,0

107410,Arma 3,this game is pretty good but i wish they had more realistic aspect towards the civilian models like children and women for some it might sound coldhearted but war is not a pretty sight so why this dismiss it and it would be a good educator for what its really like,1,1
107410,Arma 3,with 70 hours i can safely say this game is definetly worth the money it caters to all types of players casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as wasteland and king of the hill roleplaying players have stratis and altis life and tactical players can find servers with coop and team vs team missions as well as tactical groups that play the game in a very realistic manner besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources feel free to do your own research check out the zeus game mode as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found httpswwwyoutubecomuserdslyecxi tldr game is awesome very moddable hours of gameplay edit just to update the review now with a lot more hours and proper tactical gaming experience behind me i can say i rediscovered arma completely in my first mission i didnt even fire the gun and it was more fun than most of the stuff i have played before now this type of tactical gameplay might not suit everyone so if you feel like it give it a shot if not go back to the rest of the fun stuff,1,1
107410,Arma 3,you remember playing army with your friends when you were kids this game simulates everything that was going though your head at the time and then some if video games were alcohol arma 3 would be the finest wine money could buy but video games arent booze and can be further refined over time and this one has gotten to the point where i just cant play anything else that involves shooting would recommend to my own mother,1,1

107410,Arma 3,soyoure here to possibly buy arma 3i was in that position before i just bought it when it was 50 off heres a checklist for you do you like call of duty can you 360 no scope in cod do you like 9 year olds screaming on the mic if you answered yes to those then this game is not for you do you like csgo are you a pro awper in csgo well if you answered yes this game will rip you apart and you will be a sniper do you like simulators do you like military games are you up for the challenge do you want an alternative to joining the military in real life do you have at least 30 if so then you are ready for this challenge pros massive realistic combat servers with 100 people few squeakers on mics steam workshop many players still today single player modes tutorials and all kinds of training for practice cons 60 pricey but worth more than any call of duty game ai its ok playable lag this game is apparently heavily dependent on cpu in huge multiplayer games your fps can drop from over 9000 to 20 in a matter of seconds glitches bugs when people shoot from far away it sounds like bb guns trolls in multiplayer they can steal your helicopters and you buy or just be a pilot and kamikazi with you in it doesnt come with cookies,1,1
107410,Arma 3,arma iii the game where everything is possible ive played this game since december 2013 and if i look back and see how the game was at that time and how its now i feel like the game has improved so much but its still some things that needs fixing if you are into military simulation pvp roleplay etc this game is for you but arma iii is a game where you can make everything possible for example aftermath rush battlefield in arma iii and as ive said i have played this from december 2013 and i do not regret buying arma at all ive gotten so much out of this game and yes this game is worth the price and more,1,1

107410,Arma 3,the first few hours of play long can be painful and away most people arma 3 is hard to understand is not for everyone and im sure its not even that the bohemia interactive searches but if you stop to study mechanics shooting techniques positioning azimuth applied physics studying really hard you fall in love the maps are really great forcing you to use a vehicle to move around the audio is impressive scares the hell out of anyone who plays for the first time dont optimization is good i confess but if you think of buying this game buy without fear melhor jogo do mundo,1,1

107410,Arma 3,while the animations graphics lighting and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the arma series i miss the arma 2s setting units and mods arma 3s futureistic setting doesnt make sense and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd while i appreciate the new vehicles such as the mrap hunter or the newly updated ghosthawk blackhawk or any of that sort of updated feel im not saying change is a bad thing im just saying sometimes too much change isnt a great addition to the arma series was the much requested stances available to you during the game whether its leaning from standing crouching or even laying on your side in the prone position it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks windows and walls that youre either too short or too tall for there are 3 standing stances 3 crouching stances a sitting position and a prone position every stance except for sitting allows you to step out to the side or lean around cover from the prone you can peak a corner or lay on your side this vastly improves over arma 2s restricted movement it would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well but thats just wishful thinking another thing i noticed is the sound of the weapons a lot of the weapons have similar sounds which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle youre getting into while some of the sounds such as explosions vehicles and other small ambient additions are nice i feel like im often confused and lost with the sounds hopefully a good soundmod will fix this later down the road ai ai ai one thing the arma series hasnt been able to nail down is the ais movement pathing communication and skills i realize that its really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective or how but often youll either find your allies falling behind running out of formation for a second or asking where are you after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves it would be nice to see ai being able to figure out things based on other ai and not almost strictly from you combat awareness something i noticed in arma is that no matter what situation the ai in combat are lacking whether an enemy soldier or a friendly youll notice them not finding cover running into the middle of a street or from behind cover out into the open on one of my first showcase missions i was instructed by my ai squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover neat i thought he then gave me an area to suppress as i was an automatic rifleman i began laying fire down from my position my own squad leader walked next to me and as he gave an order ran right in front of me bushing me back and causing a bullet to hit him in the head resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing note the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second leaving me no time to react their aim isnt that great either you could be standing across a room and they wont be able to hit you or theyll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies ofguard yet not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it now this goes both ways to combat them being too easy you could set the dificulty to expert of veteran the problem with this is that the change is too extreme setting your game to the highest difficulty results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily you could be concealed at night in a bush and taking you out that or youll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley my advice find some friends or a group to join disable ai teammates for the mission and only play with a team made up of human players 9 times out of 10 youll be able to accurately cover teammates move together in a more realistic and effective way and it will increase your expierence 10fold heres an example of the helo ai in this game httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid203646487 another weird problem you may notice is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer you may or many not have issues and to top it off its really sporatic and without a known cause in singleplayer however this is not the case and the game runs a lot smoother and it is quite confusing and frustrating when trying to set your settings heres an example you go to singleplayer and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering the game looks great and youre real happy with it now your friend hops on or you want to go play on a server you select one with the best playerping ratio and join it you notice right away your frames are a lot worse and you sit the tinkering with your settings again mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game but when you join back to singleplayer the game looks worse and you either have to deal with the settings again or get stuck with lower graphics now changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration overall if youre a fan of the arma series or any realistic shooter id go for arma 3 while i still play arma 2 more arma 3 offers enough change when i get tired of the former improved graphics and lighting vehicle handling weapon handling and the use of different combat stances really improves over arma 2s static and prohibited movement while you wont be in the deserts of takistan or going through the dense city of zargabad the islands of stratis and altis are sure to give you the variety and fun youd want while the ai isnt improved much some of the futuristic units and factions dont fit well and the sounds can tend to be confusing arma 3 is definitely a step in the right direction and a giant leap towards success,1,0

107410,Arma 3,i rarely rate a game this high but this one is a perfect 1010 for the genre it represents vs any competitive products out there bar none the best military simulation on the pc that is available to the public and priced under 10000 yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic etc etc etc however there are no other games that combine all the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the arma series does arma iii is the continuation of the arma series which started out as operation flashpoint 1985 opf1985 was considered the best of its time when it was released and the arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created opf1985 with a simple quick mission builder a full blown complex highend mission editor mods mods and even more mods to make arma iii something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games if you want the same feature set but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars but you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than 60 and you dont need to signup for service if you want to enjoy this but cant afford it at full price or have an older or slower pc then arma ii almost as chock full of features and mods so if you cant get this get arma ii,1,1

107410,Arma 3,ive owned and played every single operation flashpoint arma and all their spin offs and this one is sheer perfection pros insane level of graphical realism at all levels such as terrain textures facial animation destruction of enviromentright up to bots that look all too human very forgiving game system that allows players with out of date gaming rigs to still be able to play the most realistic shooting system bar none employ the ace 3 workshop mod and be the sniper the kit includes everything the modern military sniper has in his kit such as wind direction compass ballistic charts and this all comes into play with true real world ballistics buildings come down certain cover doesnt provide cover bullets go through multiple people with mods in play it gets very bloody unlimited number of workshop items maps scenarios servers etc already out there and tons more coming the best most real online gaming experience a full sandbox mode that is so good that i have not been playing anything else but arma 3 for months pretty much expect to see me living in this game in my spare time this is the best game ive ever played thousands of weapons vehicles attachments bot types nationalities etc epic gigantic fully sandboxable maps that stretch miles upon miles in all directions there must be 100 maps i have at least 60 dowloaded and that i am playing with already isis taliban and other scumbagery to put hot lead into buckle up soldieryou have tea bagging to do here is the biggest one of all the mods in the workshop that are totally free give you every single mission and mapfrom all the other armas and operation flashpoints so if you liked the arma gold edition and loved playing with the vehicles and different units then tadasurprise there in here too so own one arma and own them all if you have 3 and the mods just check out the mods i subscribed to and go nuts i am stupid hillarity when you see the first guys reaction after you smoke the guy he is healing make sure you have the bloodlust mod and the head popper mod on this is a crazy one wwii units yes you can have isis taking on an ss panzer division if you wish one decision which scum bag to play as there are several mods that bring wwii units tanks and aircraft to the game and wow does it make this a game and a half to own 4 words moisin nagant sniper rifle nuff said there are too many positives to go on about the game is everything i ever wanted in a first person shooter 1010 cons you down own it yet and are stuck reading this go buy it you cheap bugger p very few still thinking stop pressing me ok a few things load times are long the servers are filled with gaming gods some mods will get you vac banned so turn off the ones that apply to getting you banned their pretty darned obvious and its simple enough to do with turn off all mods button then just click on the few that are allowed on servers no biggie some mods have issues with other mods so its like skyrim so expect a few crashes here and there as you figure out what works with what however with me having over 150 mods in play at once id say this is beyond minor you are looking for gripes right i dont have many so in the end i am going to say this is the fps you always wanted if you didnt know you wanted it and you are a gun nut a blood thirsty nut and overall fan of seeing heads coming off at the seams then luck be a lady tonightthis is your game,1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,sigh where to start its 2015 why is a game of this caliber is being locked at 30fps while the frame rate cap is editable you have to go into the config to do it instead of the main menu but that doesnt matter the game is terribly optimized whether its capped at 30 or 60fps youll get major framerate drops a single gtx 970 isnt even enough to keep it at a stable 30fps which is completely ludicrous warner brothers should be ashamed of releasing a game like this what makes it worse is that at the very last hour they edited the steam sub for the people that got the free nvidia copy for buying a gtx 970 or 980 so that they wouldnt get the harley quinn preorder bonus why do that you already give away a free game why take away a little preorder bonus that everyone else who preordered would get it just ends up making a lot of people angry for months now people have been asking whether or not the people who got the nvidia free copy would be getting the harley quinn pack they were completely unclear on it just beating around the bush this is no way to treat your fans at this point this game isnt worth buying because of technical issues and such a terrible practice by its publisher even people who got this game for free must feel like they got betrayed right now save your money wait for updates and play something else in the mean time i recommend the witcher 3 wild hunt a game that is much more optimized for pc developed by a group of people who actually care about their fans update 1 no patch yet but after some tinkering in the config file ive gotten the game to run at a somewhat more stable frame rate if i stand still or move slowly i can maintain a stable 60fps but as soon as i hop into the batmobile or start gliding around frame rate will start dropping anywhere from 50s down to the low 20s the worst part is every now and then the frame rate would tank so hard it would go down to single digit like several other people have noticed so i guess for right now maintaining a stable 60fps or even 30fps is impossible unless you want to play batman walking simulator update 2 i got a chance to play the game a little bit so this post will be about the gameplay the combat and control are great and responsive you never felt quite more like batman than you are in this game you feel powerful the entire gotham city is your playground and it feels amazing to traverse it the only problem i have with the gameplay is that driving the batmobile in pursuit mode felt pretty bad it was hard to turn around corners without smashing into something combining with the terrible frame rate and let just say i rather just glide across gotham city than drive the batmobile i really hope they tweak the control for the batmobile its my least favorite thing about the game right now battle mode however is great only because its alot easier to maneuver around with it on,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,updated 1029 for the pc rerelease that happened on 1028 many of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved but if it came out asis today i would still say the port is pretty disappointing many people who couldnt play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience the texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene image quality is all over the board but is improved quite a bit by turning off aa ca and film grain effects speaking of effects there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of postprocessing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at the most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered in 1080p lens flares look more or less as they should at 1440p youd think batman just had lasik surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a jj abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating if youre a huge batman fan and youve been waiting to play this game id say it is definitely playable now if youre on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease id say wait until it is heavily discounted original review of initial release version one of the worst pc ports of all time this game had some incredibly misleading advertising in the nvidia gamework promo reel posted to youtube by nvidia on june 6 only a few weeks before the game was released they show ambient occlusion and rain textures both of which are present in the console versions and entirely absent from the pc version the same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps but the game ships with a 30fps cap by editing an ini file you can remove the 30fps cap but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level they look pretty similar to the textures from a nintendo 64 game aside from the false advertising this game cant even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that far exceeds the recommended specifications for example despite having the game installed on an ssd and running a 980ti with the latest drivers i still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations for example any time i get in the batmobile i am watching a slide show for a few seconds save your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed if it ever does get fixed,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,edit 30102015 people are still commenting on this review so im making this edit to let people know this wasnt updated to reflect current patches in the game i returned the product shortly after it was released there has since been two performance patches which reportedly improve things i decided not to purchase it again as its so close to november when other games launch and my time is limited atm if your interested in purchasing the game look for more current reviews played it for around an hour so far the combat is fun and responsive the gliding is great and the game looks okay af is set to 4 by default which makes some textures look awful thats the good parts the bad parts are the framerate issues which are all over the place and the batmobile the game will frequently pause or dip to sub 10 fps on a gtx 970 when entering or approaching new areas cutscenes have similar issues to witcher 3 in that while in engine they run at even less fps by default the game itself is locked to 30 tweakable in the ini files than the normal game making them stutter or appear stilted summoning the batmobile causes major frame rate drops at one point i summoned the car to try the batmobile takedown move by the time the frame rate recovered the batmobile had crushed the pack of guys i was fighting including the riddler henchman i wanted to interrogate the batmobile itself handles awfully there are forced batmobile sections which involve chasing targets such as tanks or vehicles the handling makes some turns difficult to pull off and the vehicle feels clunky some have recommended turning into a tank for a small amount of time for more precise control but this kills all momentum tank mode is really boring but necessary to take out armored vehicles if you eject while under attack from armored vehicles batman will get upset someone is wrecking his car there doesnt appear to be a way yet to deal with vehicles without the batmobile which ruins the feel of the prior batman games hopefully the need for the batmobile is limited later in the game unless this is patched soon its definitely a refund i bought the game based on the prior rocksteady batman titles which played well on launch but this is a terrible pc port never really expected the game to turn out this way but i guess alarm bells should have triggered when there was no pc review prior to launch edit for those commenting my pc is below min specs its not win 7sp1 i5 3570k 8gigs ram ssd 970 gtx if you want to see what the gameplay was like for me see this video by rps it was less frequent than in the video but its the exact same symtoms httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv37kpoyvrlzm,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,post patch update my did this take a while well the game has now had a major patch and things arebetter the game is still by default held at 30fps but now an option in the menu has been added that lets you choose between 306090 fps although they do say if you put it above 60 you may experience some issues with the performance in my experience the game runs much better than before i get a solid 60fps on maximum settings not including nvidia crap during fightingwalkingglidinggrappling with almost no hitching however i must say while driving the batmobile you can get 60 around the outskirts of gotham but in the center where its busy and there are more npcs and other cars it does drop to around 50fps quite frequently while this is not great it is certainly better than the 20fps it used to be when driving the batmobile the options menu has had loads of changes more suitable to pc with texture settings actually having an option for high this time rather than just medium which brings me to the games graphics the game looks marginally better although not really in any significantly noticeable way while batman games always had that shiny polished look to all its textures i find that the moody lighting and glossy textures tend to hide the fact that some of the textures just arent that great meaning walls backgrounds and such but they are good where it matters i suppose such as the batsuit batmobile and generally all character models so should you buy it sigh this is a rather hard question but let me try to expand i feel like this game is in a playable state not perfectbut playable however i urge everyone not to forget the disaster that was this games launch in my opinion such a terrible launch and treatment of the pc community requires that we show wb and rocksteady that this is not ok by voting with our wallets and not buying this game by doing so showing them that this is unacceptable and if this is the state in which you release your games and it takes you like what 34 months to fix this then you dont deserve our money and support so if you dont have any strong reason to buy this game then please dont there are better games out there that you can still buy if however you are intent on buying this game then at least wait for a sale because working or no this game is not worth its standard price take note of this games launch and please dont preorder and keep an especially keen eye on wb games since its clear whatever they may be publish to pc will likely crash and burn since they dont give a damn about pc and pc should not give a damn about them orignal review performance issues everywhere had to use ini files to uncap the default 30fps lock i have drops to around 23fps on a rig that supersedes the recommended system requirements do you have an amd graphics card lol good luck m8 its a shame because there is a good game somewhere in here but the performance issues make it unplayable i strongly advise against buying this until it is patched and begins to work properly as it stands right now do not buy it,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this is one of the worst ports ive ever seen the framerate is capped at 30fps there are barely any graphical options you can uncap the framerate in an ini file but then the fps is all over the place even on my titan x the ps4 version actually looks better than the pc one becuase the pc is missing some shaders and effects for shame wb for shame,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,gameplay video real fun starts at min 6 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgky2behkeyeampfeatureyoutube note this review is a work in progress as a pc gamer my first couple of hours of any game is playtesting and seeing the performance on my rig i am using a 970 on stock settings and 3570k overclocked to 45ghz with 8 gigs of ram just for a frame of reference game also uses denuvo drm which has been reported in previous games that used this such as dragon age or lord of the fallen to have performance problems associated because of the processes behind the drm it is my hope that this title doesnt see any performance impacts because of the drm implementation but sadly i think it isonce again seriously do we need another layer of drm on top of the already existing drm steam ugh pc port is locked to 30 fps but you can change that turtleboats you dont need to shout man now you are making me shout to change the ini files go wherever your game is saved and go to knightbmgame configbmsystemsettingsini and change the parameter for maxfps30 to maxfps60 to delete the intro video files go to steamsteamappscommonbatman arkham knightbmgamemovies and delete startupmovie and startupmovienv graphics impressions the game is really hit or miss at times and while the game can look good some textures arent as crisp and tight as you would hoped it would be at a distance the graphics look servicable but once you get close to even some of the thugs they look like reused assets from the previous games the graphics settings in this port are honestly bare bones you cant even tweak how high you want aliasing to be set at the game looks a bit outdated in areas but that should not come as a surprise since the game is using the same engines as the previous arkham games so while they have probably maxed out what that engine can do it does not have all the bells and whistles you would like to hope for in a next gen title it looks as though without the nvidia settings the max settings on this pc port is on par with its console brother there are a limited number of specific nvidia exclusive graphics tweaks that seperate it from the console version so in that sense it is dissapointing to me the best way i can describe how the game looks is washed out the textures arent crisp enemies float above the ground after you knock them out pop in happens quite frequently the best parts to me graphically are the parts where you are soaring down around gotham and seeing all the vibrant lush neon lights gameplay impressions combat feels better than ever it feels a bit more faster and fluid than the previous games got through playing the series recently so its easy for me to compare to me i loved how the combat worked in previous games but felt it was just a tad slow nice that its sped up here no more walking through tight corridors or seeing the same locales like in asylum or even city to an extent this games world is massive zipping from building to building with batmans arsenal makes you wish a spiderman game was only this good at its web slinging action there is a great sense of speed while you coast from building to building and is quite fun one moment you are on top of building next moment you are flashing toward some thugs and blistering their bones you can now also interrogate your victims and make them spit out some pertinent information to your mission launching in and out of the batmobile in pursuit of some random street thug or being propelled in to the sky all work seemless and make me excited to play with my new toy any chance i can get its too bad the best moments and the highlight of the game the gameplay suffers because of the shoddy port quality i have had my fps drop to as low as 20 in some cases something i have never seen happen on my 970 before running a game on its max settings this is without the nvidia effects toggled on performance impressions the games open world looks good not great that said for a game that looks like this it should not have my framerate stuttering all over the place at times other open world games like the recent the witcher 3 actually look more impressive in many aspects compared to batman arkham knight and perform way more stable i think the stability and the game being locked to 30fps is a very telling sign that this port was nay is rushed without all the bells and whistles you would hope for in a next gen pc title i will update this review later with a video with my gameplay performance using the 970 thanks for reading and i am hoping to have more detailed impression as the night progresses as of now i feel a bit bamboozled out of shelling out money for this yea you can fly and punch baddies like before and its open world but it just doesnt look or perform like a next gen title should even with the nvidia fluff on the witcher 3 really made my standards of pc gaming high not only in a gameplay aspect but graphically speaking as well game feels really good when its working and smooth heck i even had tons of fun just doing donuts and seeing the smoke effects in the batmobile at 20fps glory for what its worth i quite like the batmobile segments you can cruise through walls call it in to literally steam roll a group of bad guys and it doubles as a freaking tank with eye popping particle effects the combat is tight and responsive as ever however the performance just bogs the game down way too much for me to say that this game is an instant buy right now couple this with the widely known game hindering drm denuvo it is just mind boggling companies continue to support drm practices that hinder their own game and risk the games integrity in order to make another buck or two all signs point to rocksteady rushing this port out update 1 game port was outsourced to a company named iron galaxy well there it is update 2 last update for the night its 4am uploaded a quick video of the gameplay take care for now my fellow dark knights update 3 supposedly new nvidia drivers are out today will try them out and let you guys know if anything changes update 4 june 24th thanks for everyone being informed gamers and doing their research it is my hope as well not to only get a better product i paid for and was eagerly awaiting for just like you but to help set a precedent for future pc titles from big pubsdevs pc gamers should not be treated like second class citizens we pay for digital titles that we cant sell back unlike console players and are often left mercy to the corporations its what they are to fix their games we arent guaranteed anything thankfully valve is now accepting refunds and reports of customers from thid party vendors like gmg are now willing to process refunds this is great news for us pc gamers we have no excuses anymore but ourselves if we continue to support faulty products even if we are given the chance to get a refund while i am dissapointed with this port without problems like this we as customers would continue to be treated in such a manner and there would be no progress i am willing to give rocksteady iron galaxy one chance since they know and openly admitted to screwing up this port thats a lot more than what ubisoft ever did for their scam on assasins creed unity for many of us i will continue to post my impressions of the game and keep you guys up to date as well post a follow up to the performance after the next patch iron galaxyrocksteady take your time please dont rush the patch just like you did with this port for myself personally this is your last chance update 5 rocksteady has issued a public statement saying they are pulling the game digitally in the meantime i plan on finishing the game for the review and will post my impressions on the patch when it comes out,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,terrible port which runs like crap textures looks way worse than their console counterparts ambient occlusion missing on pc port locked frame rate 30fps pc port developed by third party 12 employees this is one of the worst releases i have seen this should stand as an example of what happens when you trust a third party company unfortunately since i ordered the game from gmg i cant get a refund but i strongly suggest that people that got the game from steam should apply for a refund,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,as much that i hate downvoting a great game this titel deserve it im running a 970 with a i7 4790k and getting 30 fps and alot of problems stutter soundbugs etc i have waited and was really hyped to play this game and it saddest me too se the pc port be so bad this time around please read the updates i do in this review if you have some questions or disagreed with me pros looks like a great history only 3 hours in the game fun combat system with amazing cool combos driving the batmobile o really huge world to play in alot of things to do cons bad performance 30fps lock stutter soundbugs etc bad looking textures really bad pc port buy this game if you dont mind the problems atm i would pick it up but not for full price thanks for reading the review update 23062015 okay you can remove the 30fps lock by going to your go to this in your steam library gsteamsteamappscommonbatman arkham knightengineconfig then double click on basesystemsettings then press ctrlf and type in fps and now you can change that to 60 but i dont recomend going over 60 as it will most likley crash i still stand by the review even tho you can remove the 30fps cap this is 2015 and a game that release on pc should not have been capped at all update 23062015 i know my english isnt good but that should not stop me from doing this short review update 23062015 i have now talked to a support nvidia becaruse many have told me that the game have some problems with the gtx 9xx series nvidia says that they have a few problems with the cards and i should be fixed asap update 23062015 after i removed the cap and turn blur off im getting a steady 60 fps while running around etc sadly the fps drop quite alot when im driving the batmobile or flyving around in gotham textures are still looking bad amp many soundbugs still is there p,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,1 horrible stuttering where the framerate is anywhere between 60 and 3 fps when i glide or drive on my radeon 290x 2 30 fps lock on a pc release is unforgivable 3 nvidia game works things hammered in that makes the performance of amd cards worse thanks for being a part of the team nvidia and rocksteady 4 price of the season pass is too high for the amount of content that has been revealed to be included 5 the native antialiasing in the game options still gives the game horrible jaggies the option is either on or off for it 6 not many graphical options and those there are makes little to no differance to the performance cannot recommend at its current state im sad to see this rocksteady your past pc releases of arkham asylum and arkham city where almost flawless in both performance and stability my specs intel core i7 34 ghz asus radeon 290x 4gb 4x4gb 1600mhz corsair ram installed on a western digital ssd 160gb,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,sorry devs but thats it you really have to fix your game before releasing it 10 worst gaming optimizations out of 10,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i am happy that i got this game with my graphics card if i acutally spent 50 euros on this game i would feel like an idiot since this game is so badly optimized save your money for the hopefully fixed goty edition and then buy that on a steam sale a couple of years in the future,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,thats it im done im finally done with preorders this game is completely unplayable turns out you cant even trust studios with good track records anymore just because you like a game series that has been good so far doesnt mean the next one will be if you havent bought this game yet dont and if you have then i suggest you refund it congratulations rocksteady and wb you finally convinced me to never preorder a game again,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,broken at launch no sli support horrible motion blur generally poor performance do not buy i just cant play this game it hurts the textures are laughably bad they remind me of the playstation days you can see the individual pixels the motion blur is almost nauseating the frame rate stutters at seemingly random times please get this crapware refunded if you can i am afraid to say but you might as well consider this a console only game at the moment,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,do not buy this game really all i can say at this point im running this game at 720p and low shadows with an i5 4690k and a gigabyte 970 oc it stutters like hell looks awful and framerate drops everywhere i also never ever write reviews but im batmad,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i got it for free and i still want a refund seriously though ive got sli 980 tisim only using one with arkham knight because sli is broken atm and the game installed on an ssd and the performance is woeful if you unlock the framerate its the year 2015 ffs a 30fps cap is not acceptable especially for one of the biggest releases of the year on pc sli is broken along with the lowres texturesassets streaming issues and stuttering there is no ambient occlusion in the pc version at all rain effectsshaders are also missing that are in the console versions just check some comparisons that are starting to popup the bloody game crashes after exiting every time the pc graphics options are woeful not to mention all you get are low and normal textures thats itreally even at 4k there is aliasingshimmering and it just emphasizes the other graphical anomalies ive never had this many technical issues with a pc game also for a game that was heavily plugged by nvidia and makes use of gameworks why is there no arkham knight graphics performance and tweaking guide that nvidia routinely does for all the big game releases on their geforce website they did one for gta v witcher 3 and dying light so surely arkham knight warranted one they obviously knew this pc port was a steaming pile of crap and theyve tried to hide it as much as they could before release there were no pc reviews before release either all reviews were on the ps4 version apparently do not buy this game in its current shape cheers,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,christ i want to love this i really do but after removing the fps lock via the ini file the game still runs at what id call subpar with a few glitches thrown in for good measure also the plot so far is ing bonkers with a capital b,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,avoid this piece of trash at all cost the pc version is 100 botched missing graphical features from consoles rain shader ambient occlusion capped at 30fps by default laughable performance steam refund is a thing now i would strongly suggest you send wb and iron galaxy the ones responsible for this abomination a message do not buy edit 29 october 2015 while the september interim patched has definitely improved performance considerably its clearly not a consistently well performing game stutter still rears its ugly head and the rain effects are still bugged,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,yet another aaa title that fails actual playtesting and is shipped out to unsuspecting consumers who hoped it might not actually run like balls given this game runs on unreal engine 3 an engine pushing over 11 years old at this point it has performance that makes gta iv run like any source game in comparison rocksteady have in the past demonstrated great optimisation in previous titles my old laptop which ran a gt 555m graphics card could maintain 60 fps in arkham asylum on the highest settings this game on my gtx 970 which is one of the top 10 best graphics cards currently on the market can barely push 40 fps stationary and between 530 whilst moving good thing we got that enhanced nvidia driver to improve our performance i think the worst part is that graphics wise its not really much of an improvement over its predecessors the post processing effects look really nice and the rain effects are pretty gorgeous but the overall texture and model quality just barely look better than arkham asylum and that game came out nearly six years ago i cannot recommend this to anyone until they fix the performance issues also you can tell its probably a shoddy console port because the left the 30 fps cap in the ini file stay classy rocksteady,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i try to play the game but it crash when the first logo appeared when finally i can play the game i discover a 30 fps cap a lot of microshuttering a downgrade finally when i close this jokeport it continous run at 2 plane i try to play it again perhaps it was a bad joke and the real game was waiting for me message error try to verify the steam cache missing 4000 files i have to download the game again thank you rocksteady edit the final version is released whit a few changes now we can run it at 60 fps with freezes 7 sec is my best with better graphics you can edit the ini an get the same result since the launch day and some stuff more conclusion refund it if you can plz pd sry for my bad english,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,one of the crapiest game launches this year 30fps lock editable but lol preorder version switched to retail nvidia promo in last hour before release to force people to buy the dlcs instead optimization is terrible textures are weird titanx cant maintain 60fps on 1080p so far its thumbs down from me,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i cant recommend the game in its current condition who cares about the 30fps cap because thats an easy fix in the ini files the stuttering and freezing however happens even on the lowest settings and it is unfixable ive never played a game with stuttering this bad before and ive played games with a dying gpu im giving this game the two weeks before i refund it which i probably cant due to it being from a thirdparty my review will change when the game is playable edit 2 i recently had to upgrade my video card from an nvidia gtx 680 2gb to a gtx 970 4gb does the game run any better sort of the stutter issues dont happen so immediate though they start appearing after extended play plus with this video card there should be no reason for these low framerates on normal settings in an unreal engine 3 game edit 3 thanks to the new video card ive been able to play it a little more and ive discovered the harley quinn dlc can be completed in a mere 19 minutes unless she can be used as a challenge mode character like catwomanrobinnightwing in arkham city this preorder dlc is truly garbage,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,sad to see our beloved hobby go down in flames like this been gaming since atari 2600 and this gen has just been full of lies fake realtime ingame footage sleazy marketing swines by publishers and nvidia and blatant false advertising this is all besides the nickel and diming of microtransactions and chopped games to sell dlc enough is enough this was it for me especially after taking time off work for this launch paying for what i expect to be a working product as advertised and flaunted by puclishersnvidia as high performance graphical tech and spending these aaa launch days extremely frustraed just trying to get them running at a barely decent playable level rather than enjoying playing the game giving them our money for broken products is unacceptable and the ftc should step in at this point to assist with consumer rights i never preorder yet i allowed everyones hype to convinced me to do so i will certainly not be preordering or purchasing any games on day one until i see the actual game running on either youtube or twitch,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,after this games rerelease i can safely say that it is not worth 50 dollars im running a gtx 970 and an i54690k and i get mostly 60fps gameplay however when it comes to gliding and the batmobile the performance is just awful in some cases the fps goes to the mid 30s get this when it goes on sale in six months wb really screwed the pooch and you should wait until it goes on sale,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,congrats you have now knocked ac unity off the pillar for the worst release ever,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,at the moment the game has many issues fps cap can be turned off by config file bad performance and horrible stuttering all around even on the lowest settings looks promising but needs a patch to fix things up on its current state its barely playable patch needed my rig gtx 780ti 3gb 16gb ram i7 3770k 340ghz edit 301015 games back on store however vram requirements are still too demanding on highest settings causing unusual stutter during the gameplay normal to high settings require more than 2gb of vram not worth to get unless youve at least a 2gb card and up to play the game on low quality,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,unfinished unoptimized game that deserves all the negative reviews right now,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,months ago this game was bashed by every pc user for the horrible launch since then ive watched and read dozens of reviews of both pc and ps versions and it was still getting mixed bad opinions therefore i had low expectations when i bought it a few days ago only expecting the tech issues to be fixed now that ive finished the game i can safely say it was a great and very enjoyable experience i wont spoil anything here not a big fan of the ending but it was a great story all the little touches and details you would expect from the previous games are here as well never had a stutter or crash and im on a slightly above average pc wont go in detail just want to say this if you were put off by the faillaunch and negative reviews since then give this game a chance i love the previous ones in the series but this is the first one i almost completed at 100 only riddler trophies remain and they are really a grind and the top point of many reviewers that the car is shoved on you and takes away i was afraid of that but no really no it adds and takes sometimes but its not in any way obtrusive if in doubt buy on sale,1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this port is so bad that even pirates dont sail near it,-1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,46 minutes of play time and ive had two hard crashes id really love to play this game it looks great but apparently my i7 4ghz system 24gb of ram ssd and r9 390 gpu isnt enough to keep it running good job guys youve taken a game running on an mature extremely profilicly deployed engine and somehow made it choke to death youre rereleasing it this week good luck with that i think ill just go wait for fallout 4 and get a refund edit 24gb not 20 for those commenting odd numbered ram does not a broken game make try again edit 2 up to 13 hours of playtime 8 crashes holy bad patch batman,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,really shameful how warner bros pushed one of the best devs out there to the point of ruining the finale of the best batman series ever made dont get me wrong i bet the story and gameplay are great i wish i was able to enjoy them again kudos warner you wont ever see my money again httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8xkvvktuju,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,rocksteady promised that slicrossfire would be fixed by the rerelease of the pc version of arkham knight and they have apparently lied to the batman gaming community yet again there is a reason they are not sharing patch notes do not buy this until they fix their game with the promised fixes,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,still broken and barely playable,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,spoilerfree review my specs windows 10 with 8gb ram and an amd radeon rx 480 graphics card there is a lot to be said about the final chapter of this trilogy and while not all of it is good i still definitely recommend the game lets get the bad out of the way so that we can focus on the good first every time i entered the game i was warned that i only had 4gb of ram and that the game recommended six looks at my specs mentioned above then back at warning yep im pretty sure that eight gigs is not the same as four but i digress this did not seem to affect my gameplay glitches i only saw two actual game glitches one was where a character mysteriously appeared outside of the compound where id been fighting his crew and the other was that the bat signal indicated a quest item being over the wrong building not bad as far as glitches go technical difficulties they are many and could be gamebreaking if you are not comfortable with adjusting some files i had no troubles in the beginning but then the problems started lagging crashing and even completely shutting down my computer with zero warning cries lagging i can deal with crashing i can deal with shutting off my computer over and over again whyyyyy it started happening so often that despite how much i was enjoying the game i was beginning to think that id have to stop playing and then i found the master fixes for batman arkham knight thread here at steam and my hope was rekindled it turns out a couple of files corrupt over time and all i had to do was delete one file and one folder then verify the integrity of the game cache very easy on both points and voil working game cue angels singing graphics if you dont have a new enough graphics card the game wont even start for you the plus side of the highspec card is that the graphics are amazing from the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers gotham city truly feels alive every crack in the sidewalk every fierce tattoo each choppy wave an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know more the people may not be as attractive as in previous installments but they are more realistic and they truly have character the devs have introduced a photo mode where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360degree rotation to get just the perfect shot just use the steam shortcut you set up f12 default to take screens and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot the gadgets we do have a couple of new gadgets to play this time around a voice synthesizer which allows us an extra layer of tactics by giving orders to assailants plus the batmobile which ill come back to in a bit the gadgets are by and large underutilized and not really explained bringing back my recommendation to play the games in the order in which they were released asylum city origin knight not only will these previous installments give you a feel for the story combat gameplay and general useful knowledge but youll get to play some great games the interface most of the controls are the same as what were accustomed to though they had to do some tweaking in order to include the batmobile what a great addition to the series not only can you zoom around gotham city like a boss you can destroy half the city as you go i had great fun running down criminals literally muwahaha blowing up cars knocking down trees fences support pillars you get the idea evil grin in addition to a new form of transportation we have a great many quests riddles and fights to win using the batmobile which is not only a car but a battlemoblie at the touch of a button we can transform it to a highlymaneuverable tank in order to kick all we can even do batmobileassisted takedowns with waynes patented nonlethal rounds its like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla many of the batmobile quests are optional but you will need to develop some proficiency in driving it as eventually youll have to use it to progress in the story combat as usual for the series combat starts off deceptively easy then amps up in difficulty as you progress we have the new fear multitakedown ability which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds provided that you can come upon the group by surprise there are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once and during this time you can do multicharacter takedowns those are great fun let me tell you d we have some new attacks that we can do whilst gliding plus the items mentioned above but nothing really gamechanging about the combat weve got our guys with riot shields cattle prods brutes guns and a few little extra things that ill let you discover for yourselves the story when the game started i felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline i went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was but why we were being attacked absolutely positive right up to the moment of the unmasking and then everything changed that which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating my mental shift was profound as far as such things go and it pulled me into the story in ways i had never considered although one aspect of the story i had totally nailed there were several real surprises throughout something which i really cherish a good story is something that i truly appreciate but you have a good story with great gameplay and im in heaven the endingthe riddles still no spoilers you must secure a certain number of criminals in order to view the final sequence of the game you do not have to 100 the game to see the ending but to get the full ending you have to defeat the riddler and that means solving saving maneuvering finding and destroying a total of 243 riddles people courses trophies and destructible items the riddles are the one thing i wont be doing 100 on this time around though i did get 100 on the rest of the content if like me you dont plan to solve every single riddle in order to secure the postriddler portion of the ending then never fear youtube is here although some may feel that its not really important to see that extra tidbit of story one little sentence during this scene completely changed how i felt about the ending of the game im not gonna add a link since thats just too tempting to click and i want this to be spoilerfree the bottom line batman arkham knight is flawed the devs have no plans to fix that which is broken but you can fix the problems yourself if youre a fan of the series and can problemsolve enough to follow the instructions in the master fixes for batman arkham knight thread then it is absolutely worth your trouble i enjoyed this title immensely despite the frustrations with the technical difficulties i would even start the game over again right this minute if it werent for the fact that i have so many other games that i want to play in closing i loved this game and if it werent for the technical problems that i encountered it would be my favorite of the series as it stands i rank them as follows arkham city arkham knight arkham asylum and then arkham origins definitely a mustplay i am batman i am the night,1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this is one of the worst pc ports i have ever seen its basically the ps4 version shoveled onto pc like the massive pile of crap it is its locked to 30 fps and still runs like crap it has constant stuttering and the most bare bones options menu i have ever seen in a modern title gameworks destroys my framerate on a 970 and its even worse for amd users the game looks awful and the mothionblur effect which cant be turned off is nauseatingstay away from this game if you prepurchased it take advantage of the new return policy,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,also known as assassins creed unity 2 enhanced stuttering edition,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,crappy performance fps capped at 30 fps lack of advanced graphics options lot of textures bugs game was outsourced to a third party developer and did a shoddy job on the port dont buy this garbage,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,horrible game it continously flickers upon launch cant be played with gtx 970m 16gb ram,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,gtx 980ti i7 ssd fully water cooled rig games goes down to 30fps this is a joke game isnt worth a single penny avoid and season pass for almost the same price as the full game are you taking a with people,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,at this moment in time the game is broken and not just a normal broken but broken in a way that some people will find it very unenjoyable you can fix the 30 fps problem by editing the ini files lord knows why they locked it in the first place but thats not the point i have a 2gig gtx 960 its obviously the biggest regret of my rig so far but im waiting for the next line of gpus to come out before i waste my money on a 980ti i have stuttering when turning the camera when driving etc its crazy bad even on the lowest settings i do get 60 fps in a majority of areas but as soon as i turn the camera or drive it dips in the 40s its sad because the game stutters even worse when i lock it back at 30 fps its just flat out broken concerning performance and i really wish to enjoy the game the arkham games are some of my favorite games of all time and i will give a positive review once these performance problems are fixed until then save your money,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,warner bros is official a worse than ubisoft let me explain why when ac unity came out broken the company stopped the development of dlcs rolled out patches weekly and the game was mostly fixed within 2 months ubisoft even gave the players a complimentary dlc but what does wb do nothing the games been out for almost 2 months now not a single patch came out since instead they keep making dlc for the consoles you think that after such terrible launches as battlefield 4 or the previously mentioned ac unity companies would learn to ship their games finished but obviously that isnt the case,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,at this point i am hoping more green lantern movies are produced by warner brothers so they can stop with the broken aaa titles and go back to ruining aaa movies,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,dodgy publisher do not purchase,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,edit 20150904 my game actually runs worse postpatch first off this is an inexcusably terrible port especially from a developer whose budget vastly exceeds the million dollar mark i find it ironic that they delayed the limited edition due to quality issues yet were perfectly content with releasing this broken incomplete mess as it is on pc the fps is locked to 30 by default and suffers dips to the single digits when moving fast due to what i suspect to be a texture streaming issue while there is an option to unlock it its best left on as it creates instabilities and the constant drops from 60 fps to 10 20 fps make for an annoying experience i hope the steam refund is used in wide effect this trend of games launching in such state is getting rather tiresome the game itself is mediocre featuring the same overly simple monotonous combat from the previous installments and most of the same gadgets only this time you get access to the bat mobile which does create a few cool moments but soon becomes extremely repetitive when youre forced to use it on nearly every mission in the game the voice acting is horrible beyond the so bad its good mark it comes across as tired and uninspired where the characters ingame sound like they care little for the current situation with a stiff almost sarcastic tone and hardly ever fits the mood of the moment at hand the world features some nice design choices and looks pretty good in my opinion the aesthetics of the game are not too shabby either the plot is laughably bad this is lower grade writing defined not that i care much for it in most games but in a game like this thats heavily narrative driven its bad the characters are pretty dull and generic too along with their cringe worthy dialogue that makes for plenty of moments where youre likely to let out a sigh its as if they read a few comic books watched some of the movies amp cartoons and took the cheesiest most generic lines they could find and threw them in there while this is essentially the same batman game as before and youre likely to find some enjoyment out of it if you dont mind the monotony of being forced to use the batmobile for a good portion of the game and if you really liked the other ones and are a fan of batman in general id recommend waiting atleast a year for them to iron this mess out and get a version inclusive with the swamp of dlcs planned imyself will never buy anything from this studio again their attitude is awful and they clearly shafted pc gamers to the bottom of the pedestal like most aaa devs of this era do,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this game looks fun cant wait to play it in a few weeks when it works,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,yeah the 28th october big pc patch is out now game runs as bad as initial launch worse than the first patch that fixed minor issues still no sli support forces one of my two gpus to sit idle during this game absolutely blank patch notes for a 24gb patch all they did was release dlc for pc as compensation they give out games that are on sale every alternate month for 5 and everyone already owns them especially if they bought this game on pc im done,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this is how the batman died oh the irony you know somethings wrong when you have to take it off the store just to fix the damn thing edit they finally fixed it after a year works great however i am leaving this as a thumbs down because its outrageous it took this long,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,iv finished the game at 100 but making it took me more hours than really needed and all because of the bad performance of the title i recommend it now that the realease patch has been released but only if you buy it out of steam because is not worth the 4599 euros they want you to pay in some pages it costs less than 10 euros and the season pass 12 i will regret for the rest of my life the prepurchase of this game first and last game i prepurchase ever oh and one last thing where is the season pass they promised for the people that supported them since the release more than 3 months ago i dont find it fair that you sell a game in these conditions and give nothing to the people that literally wasted their money on it,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,disaster preload bsod not kidding happened while it was trying to unpack 4 hours of startup repair followed by needing to download another 33 gigs load the game no pc specific settings 5 or 6 unskkipable intro scenes 30 fps lock and it ctd with a fatal error when i ran the performance test do not buy and endorse this absurdity,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,its been over a year nowi finally bought the game on a steam sale only to discover it is absolute garbage my system excceds the recommended specsall drivers are current and it still crashes 910 times it tries to move from a cinematic into game play rocksteadys response to my inquires was we regret to inform you that at this time we are no longer supporting or adding material to the pc release so rocksteady can kiss my business good bye they have had a year to fix thisthey put it back up for sale and the game is still broken dont buy it give your money to someone that makes games that are working on release and offers support to their customers update finally got this game working on 92516 took a lot of efforts going through forums on steam and on other 3rd party sites i appreciate the input of so many commentators below that said i stand buy the review and the recommendation a player should not have to resort to the player forums mods and the fan community to get a product to work it is poor customer support planning and product management rocksteady provided no help in their communications steam support actually refered me to more resources and they followed up rocksteady dropped the ball on this product i called them on it i stand by it update 2 101816 after months of trying to log on to wbplay forums to get the zur en arrh skin i brought up the problem in the wb forums was their reaction to provide support was it to unlock the skin for me was it to apologize for their poopr infrastructure and almost 60 day delay in being able to access content i was promised none of the above instead they banned my account and access the the wbplay site for life not just arkham knight but all wbplay forums community access and other information this game and everyone involved in it are a sick joke to hell with rocksteady to hell with wb and to hell with arkham knight dont buy it you cant get any support unless its from the players they are the one redeeming quality of this crap pile of a game,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,scarecrow unleashed the fear toxen on the pc community now some of their worst fears are manifesting in the new batman game can batman offer us any optimization patches is there any hope left for us power up the bat signal,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this is the game we all need right now but not the one we deserve,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this game was developed by joker to troll batmans fans on the pc,-1,0
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,playing on a 970 at 1080p game has a 30 fps lock that can be turned off in the bmsystemsettingsini in the bmgameconfig folder change maxfps30000000 to whatever you want but the framerate is so inconsistent its probably best to keep it locked to 30 i can get it to 60 fps when nothing is happening flying around or driving plumets the framerate to sub 30 at times and this is with all the gameworks stuff off game lacks many many graphical options they might be in the ini files but not in the game after playing it more there is a lot of really bad textures all throughout the game this is an unreal engine 3 game so im guessing its having pop in issues the limited graphics options is a huge negative especially since the previous games have had a decent amount of options not a good pc port wait for it to get better good thing we can get refunds now i guess,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i had the graphics on full settings until around halfway through the game when it lagged out so much that i thought i had suddenly returned to the game et the extraterrestrial however i will try to focus on the actual game instead of the graphics good interesting story good number of returning villains interesting villains not just boring ones with the exception of the riddler funny thug dialogue good new fighting mechanics not including the batmobile allows you to use the batmobile introduces new classic characters lucius fox red hood manbat gives returning characters more development along with their own missions azrael firefly deathstroke dlc isnt just rehashed ideas good references and easter eggs bad story gets repetitive in some places some returning villains have extremely boring side missions riddler deathstroke hush new villains also have extremely boring side missions pyg deacon blackfire riddler riddles are getting really boring you have to solve all 243 riddles to complete the game 100 which is complete bullsht deathstroke the only villain who can match batmans skill is reduced to a tank battle boss fight fanfavourite villains arent in the game deadshot bane mr freeze the batmobile is overused and it is used in almost all side missions at least 3 times the batmobile removes the need for avoiding sentry guns allowing you ro just run them over and an honourable mention rocksteady completely ignored pc gamers and focused on xbox and ps,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,this is another example of a aaa title ported to pc and getting ruined to a state of complete disarray because the developers have the bright idea to focus on crap consoles and outsource over a third of their market to some shady virtually unknown 3rd party dev team to do the pc porting i actually had high hopes for this game after asylum and city never played origins but i feel now the same way i have when darksiders 2 came out i guess the only thing that sort of saves me is the hardware i have but what the hell is this crap about capping the frame rate i thought only ubisoft is into the fps capping im sitting on a g1 gtx980 16gb ddr4 and an intel i7 5960x and i get dips under 50 at minimum in certain places during the benchmark test the game offers in the main menu with a res of 1920x1080 24 screen and everything else enabled and maxed outif thats the case for me i dread to think of what people with more mainstream setups experience,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,man i cant wait for the pc port to come out,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,best batman slideshow ever seriously though i would love to give this game a good review but i cant until its fixed,-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,i got it for free and i still feel ripped off,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,its a sad day not for a batman fan but for a pc gamer who waited who anticipated and who paid for the game in this state its total garbage and absolute disdain for pc gamers all around the world so what we have blur normal for highest texture setting blur 30 fps lock more blur god dammit and of course the most grandeur thing is tada nvidia no ambient occlusion and rain effects httpiimgurcommd7v0yzpng yeah guys you shouldnt have killed the joker cos now you yourselves are no more than a sad sad joke ps ive played only 40 minutes cos game crashed and ive checked cache stuped me now im downloading this for the third time i can really smell the joker around,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,fun game if you like playing with 10fps and having your pc crash to reboot every 30 min i would stay clear of this till its fixed edit so after the recent patch and also a new evga gtx 970 the game is actaully playable but it still studders here and there when flying or driving around,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,its like playing a powerpoint slideshow,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,id write a review if the game would stop crashing even on the lowest settings does that answer your question,-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,so when does the fix come out,-1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,its hard to describe why dark souls is so so good yet its so incredibly easy why we just need to look at the core attitude of dark souls from a designtoplayer perspective dark souls is challenging yes that much is clear but its not to laugh at you or to discourage you its hard because it knows what youre capable of and it believes in you it doesnt want you to give up despite killing you all the time it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard dark souls wants you to succeed and this gives it the framework to do so many things right in that regard dark souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect the story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you dont take the time to read item descriptions examine the world and talk to every npc you meet you will be torn apart if you dont take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield most of all if you dont take your time you will be seeing you died a lot as well the game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses it wants you to slow down weigh all of your options experiment and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive combat is slow but weighty everything about the fighting is spot on small weapons swing fast like they should large weapons swing slow and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying clunk sounds every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina its a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player you can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can but you wont be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina all of this goes double for the intense boss fights most of the bosses wont hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything youve learned thus far you will die a lot but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment because you did it all with your own skill the world of dark souls is completely open there are very few loading screens there are no transitional airlocks between areas everything is seamlessly connected to each other at times the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places suddenly everything feels natural dark souls atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention at times youll be exploring dark moody caverns other times youll be wading through a dense moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you sometimes youll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress make sure you always have your wits about you and youre actively paying attention the world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that adventure experience ive come to miss so bad the world is yours and youre free to go wherever you please at times you might feel like youre a bit lost and i do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction but there are subtle clues and hints are the enemies too hard in a certain area is there a locked door theres probably another way you havent explored yet the world is also home to many npcs i mentioned before that if you dont take the time to talk to the npcs you meet and try to piece together who they are what theyre doing and how they got where they are youre going to miss out of a lot of dark souls story this is where i feel dark souls thematic focus comes full strength the entire game is about overcoming and fighting through your own struggles in that same sense all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something something they thought was important or something they hold dear really take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well you wont know where they go next if you dont listen with that said if you make the effort to witness each of these stories youll watch them struggle along with you fighting their own battles yes dark souls is rich with lore and backstory but i think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in while you yourself are fighting your own battles too dark souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system at all times your character will be in either one of two forms hollowed or human you spend a somewhat uncommon item called humanity to turn from hollow to human this enables you to partake in jolly cooperation if youre in an area where you havent beaten the boss yet you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area as long as theyre relatively near your soul level sounds good right just like the combat theres another consequence you might have to face when you turn human dark souls allows players to invade the worlds of other human players they will appear as red phantoms and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight essentially marking this games version of pvp now this is where i feel dark souls biggest community strength comes from you see once a player invades you all bets are off they might be insanely twinked out they might be a fair fight they might want to honor duel you you might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of honor code when it comes to pvp they like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling with no help from other players or no healing stuff like that some players agree with doing this some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places not knowing what either party will be up against some players are firmly rooted in the idea that pve and pvp should not intertwine theyll even go as far as to never turn human what honor or etiquette should be included in dark souls pvp if any is still being debated today i feel like there will never be one solid answer but i think thats okay it allows for more discussion and i think theres something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an ingame mechanic should work bottom line try at least a couple times to play through the game in human form the invasion mechanic is a part of the game and even though sometimes youll get ganked its an experience quite like no other dark souls is challenging but not unfair to be honest the difficulty this game is notorious for isnt as bad as a lot of people make it out to be dont get me wrong though there is still a lot of obstacles youll have to overcome and at times itll feel like youre stuck but dont give up never give up in todays world of modern game development its very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think perceive and act dark souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design and it stands as one of my all time favorite games highly recommended well now you know and i can die with hope in my heart,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,hard yes frustrating sometimes unfair never worth it without a doubt,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,ive had a lovehate relationship with this game for years my first three attempts were miserable failures and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay it took a fourth attempt to understand where i went wrong this game is not a bully or a menace it is not unfair dark souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard sure he tosses you a few practice pitches gets you warmed up makes you feel like youre in the big leagues suddenly you eat a screwball to the temple you cry at first moan maybe fuss a little and then get up to catch another the stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up throughout this process your father slams a fastball into your gut sails a slider into your genitals cracks your skull with a curveball and hell throw a second ball just when youre barely figuring out the first now you can give up whenever you want make a big deal about it about how dad is cheating or hes being mean or that its all just a big waste of time your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove the truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed hes teaching you by showing not by telling hes preparing you for something much much worse that lurks ahead dont fight it he wants you to succeed but hes going to make you work for it take your lumps say goodbye to your precious souls and above all else prepare to die,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls is hard thats the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned i think that people have become spoiled or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use weve become used to pressing a for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen were used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome were used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death if dark souls is a difficult game then its because it actually respects the player i know that i find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator if you die and you will then its because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience or its because youre not paying attention or being too careless dark souls rewards adaptability and experience if dark souls is difficult then its not because it is unfair but because we are weak and need to shape up another claim ive seen bandied about is that dark souls is light on story but i do not believe this to be true the story like the difficulty treats the player with respect were not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper the majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design we approach the game as an explorer travelling to the cataclysmic land of lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges the way the lore is delivered reflects this does this mean that it is light on story only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives dark souls iswas a bad pc port it is internally rendered at a fixed low resolution cant really be played without a controller and the worst of all curses uses games for windows live dsfix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues therell be a patch released this month to remove gfwl so that takes care of another issue honestly the game is such a masterpiece that its worth recommending even with the above porting issues but its nice to know that the two main gripes i dont mind using a controller personally are not issues any longer subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction dark souls is not an amusement park ride but more like a long forgotten dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind i played dark souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles i didnt hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to pc ive since played through seven more times with another three characters i suppose you could call me a fan of the series i obviously recommend it,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,once finished with dark souls you will never enjoy a game the same way again 1110 best life ruiner ever,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,id recommend this game under one condition take the advice in the title and prepare yourself death is not failure but it is common first a bit of background coming into this game and having never touched either it or a controller before i actively disliked a lot about it i hated the vancian cast limits placed on the magic still do in fact id prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar i also expected to be able to play it immediately but instead was advised to get dsfix no seriously get it immediately to ensure that it worked well the first time around i had to buy a controller just to play the game since the mampk combo didnt work out the only reason i even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it and it wasnt all that expensive all in all i was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it and then i actually played the game and its amazing lets ignore the setting for a minute because its awesome on its own lets ignore the depth of the lore and the subtlety behind it for the same reasons lets look at the combat and the exploration and the gameplay of the game i have never seen a game so dedicated to making it your fault when you die its not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in and if you do that you instantly double your chances of survival trying out a weapon and learning its quirks before fighting the enemy is absolutely vital so that you know how to time your hits the attacks the enemies use are for the most part very easy to read if you just wait a minute and figure it out its not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while and if you attacked them its on your head once you understand the basic mechanics the game becomes downright refreshing i dont know about you but i hate it when i die in a game and it wasnt my fault i need to be able to see where i screwed up and fix it this is the game that lets you do that and if youre not willing to do so of course the game is super hard of course youre getting punished if youre not willing to learn and get good you deserve punishment in summary though this game is not for casuls this game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base this game is a trial by bonfire and passing through will temper you into a better gamer and possibly a better person git gud stay warm praise the sun and kill the dogs first good luck out there and dont you dare go hollow,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,i was always afraid to play dark souls ive heard the horror stories ive heard of people spending hours on a boss ive heard of people raging and almost quiting the game and i went through all of that and im glad i did because i experienced one of the best games ive ever played and dispite looking at guides and getting help im proud that i was able to beat the game i could go on about what the game is and what it does but lets be honest everyone whose played games before has heard of this game im basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before i played it if your worried about the difficulty about getting upset at the game you will its almost a guarentee you will have to look up guides to figure out what youre supposed to do next but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game and after you realize that death in this game isnt a punishment but more of a learning experience you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works there are definitely some frustrating elements that i think are way too unfair but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design i think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses if you decide it isnt for you after that that is prefectly fine but a lot of people play for an hour die and say it was too frustrated and admittedly i did that for a long time but if you give this game a fair chance i think youll realize that it really isnt as frustrating and hard as people think dark souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games ive ever played and ill definitely play it again at some point you owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation buy at full price,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,in this review ill try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game the difficulty the graphics the gameplay the lore the difficulty first of all and probably the reason why this game is so famous or infamous is the difficulty this game aint that hard it punishes every single mistake the player makes often with death i often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase its artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies its not true this game forces to learn sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row the mechanics but once you have learnt them you can easily kill almost every single boss made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck i said that this game punishes mistakes but not only the players ones even the one made by the ai there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them because 90 of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire its a challenge no more words needed the graphics the graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful maybe is not that pumped but its so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty the textures are a bit gross and at a closer look ugly but the way they are implemented in the world with every collapsed building grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world the textures are just perfect the light is not that well done but when its dark for gods sake its really dark not dark like meh i can barely see stuff dark like where the hell am i going where the hell is the road am i still alive was that a damned arrow the gameplay this game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic rpg game with quests npcs and maps it gives only two directed suggestions in lordran level up and kindle at bonfires ring two bells and gtfo stop no more instructions no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening youre alone in this dark and shattered world people will trick you people will invade you from their world people will your game up killing npcs the only way to know where you have to lead next is reading everything on every item there is a description that tells you everything you need where to go where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses every single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons and im not saying that every weapon class has a moveset every single weapon dont ever try to do a 3v1 in an area unless youre overleved you will probably get rekt or finish without estus potions this game is divided in areas at the end whereof there is a boss fight until the final boss is killed people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities in the other hand until the area is freed you can convoke players last but not least when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor cointaing the souls and the humanity you had you can pick them up restoring everything you had but if you die again trying sayonara souls use a controller the lore some people complains that this game has no lore this happens because just like what you have to do no one says what the hell is going on but items ambientations enemies will scream out loud what happened and what is going on quoting the director of the game a well designed world could tell its story in silence watch this video now like a moth fluttering towards a flame 1010,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls isnt an especially hard game its just a lot harder than most mainstream games today i like to say its an early 90s action rpg with modern 3d graphics and controls in every aspect the central thing that sets dark souls apart as well as demons souls before it is that it actually tries to respect the players intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices todays mainstream games adopt it doesnt hold your hand it doesnt constantly prod you in the right direction it doesnt spoonfeed you the storyline it wont try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do the developers at from software arent even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game dark souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do in terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player i personally would say dark souls is about in line with most super nes games it actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic mega man and mega man x games while playing you have to accept the fact that youre going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game but from software doesnt care dark souls is definitely a punitive game when you die you lose souls a resource representing both your experience points and currency which you get one chance to retrieve checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game though you can save and quit literally anywhere the game autosaves after pretty much any action so every single decision you make big or small is final many people have called dark souls the ultimate example of tough but fair in video games even the tutorial manages to be at once smooth enticing and a bit challenging the first time i tried demons souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls which are basically the same in dark souls its a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand on an xbox 360 pad the b button representing dodge and the management of a stamina meter the rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper the tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesnt ever stop you to talk your ear off dark souls even manages to stand out among action rpgs by nailing a unique balance between rpg statbuilding and action game skill its not a twitch game at all its action combat is rather slower than most games requiring good timing patience and attention to enemy patterns a lot like old school game but in 3d as an rpg dark souls is about watching equipment stats your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game resistances and a few other base stats but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills in fact with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior its possible to beat dark souls with a level 1 character another part of dark souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design it takes many hours to realize it but dark souls is basically a 3d metroidvania its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design oftentimes a checkpoint in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didnt even know was there one of my favorite things about dark souls though what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten is carry a dark sense of mystery its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity its a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like ultima underworld from software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction dark souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself never really giving you much of any clues as to what youll encounter next only just enough warning for evervigilant players at the same time paying attention to environments item descriptions and npcs starts to reveal whats going on in the story as well as some of the games lore things like this are pretty much the games only storytelling devices those environments show dark souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics the game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles ps2era games but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies its all medieval fantasy but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy dark souls obviously doesnt pull its looks from other rpgs but rather straight from actual medieval architecture clothing armor design and fables dark souls isnt a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the pc ports rushed development cycle unless durantes dsfix is applied the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended furthermore your performance is highly dependent on your cpus base clock speed if its under 30ghz youre going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads youre running dark souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation but if youre tired of aaa games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually lets you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment dark souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls is an incredible experience that challenges you in many ways it can be difficult but outside of one midgame boss fight it never seems ridiculous dungeons are extremely welldesigned i have played a lot of rpgs in my life and this seriously has some of the most interesting huge incredible set of crafted dungeons ive ever seen in addition to this the game is beautiful and the boss battles are intense and memorable for the uninitiated dark souls is a combatoriented rpg the world is beautifully designed and rendered the aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous breathtaking vistas to eerie haunted locales the sparse npcs are laconic have their own agendas and come and go despite your desires there are no random unimportant npcs in this game the world of dark souls is dangerous mysterious and lost the game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps that said this game can be very frustrating i die a lot i have fallen off cliffs i have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character i have been killed by other players repeatedly i have been poisoned i have been ambushed so is it fun yeah i think so there is something exciting about exploring your way through a boobytrapped fortress that would give indiana jones a run for his money it is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness beat him to a pulp and walk away with his magic ring its exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when youve come way too far to go back but dont want to dare fate and push ahead its exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you this game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes i recommend this game to anyone but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience this isnt just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion this is a universe of its own with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative you could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience things are constantly evolving and with such multifaceted questlines the number of different character builds and tools available to each player the replay value is huge i really recommend that you visit the wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level itll make things a lot less frustrating also i mean youll still die regardless walkthrough or no walkthrough and youll die a lot but at least youll know what to expect kinda,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,i was a bit afraid of trying this game because of its reputation of being difficult after 200 hours of playing i think that yes its challenging and it will test your patience first time in sens funhouse fortress but its not as difficult as some people make it seem what i liked melee combat i usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun gameplay the pace of the game play is on the slower side and involves a lot of trial and error youll die quickly if you try to play it hackandslash style the more you die the more you learn level design interconnected areas hidden areas shortcuts sens funhouse p loading screens only a few loading screens when loading your save when you die and respawn and when using fast travel skippable cutscenes most cutscenes are skippable visuals it doesnt have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful weapons there are a lot of weapons in this game with different movesets for each kind of weapon armor design this is usually my pet peeve in rpgs i was surprised that a japanese game had practicallooking armors and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many rpgs there are ridiculouslooking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them jolly cooperation d meh the trek from bonfire spawn point to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times no pause probably because of multiplayer not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards during boss fights if you have to take care of something for a short while you cant pause so youll have to repeat from the start lag during invasions fixed by altf4 p other stuff using a controller is highly recommended use dsfix to fix the resolution remove 30 fps lock use texture mods etc if youve seen edge of tomorrow thats basically how dark souls plays like,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,things i learned about dark souls during the first few hours of playing you can backstab for easy kills so can the enemies like bumble bees the asylum demon defies physics do not go near skeletons they dont want to be your friends not do they want to stay down long the merchant can be killed for a nice sword unlike the rest of the dead in undeadburg he doesnt respawn nor does his item stock leaving you temporarily up creak without anywhere to buy a paddle when you badly need said paddle never play chicken with a taurus demon they always win dragons do not fight fair rats are truly pests after the first bell everything you thought was hard was just a warmup get used to poison and toxins this game is so fecking hard this game is so fecking good,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,short version one of the best rpg games ever made thats coming from a gamer whos played over a hundred rpg titles in his life dark souls 9510 i myself put in around 400 hours on my ps3 version until people stopped playing dark souls on the ps3 thats when i bought the pc version and the rest is history long version darks souls so much to say about the title its not your average day game thats for sure the game throws the player in a very difficult world not just by gameplay standards but plotwise as well the narrative is played in such a way that its never speaking to the player but rather to your character it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining and from then on youre completely on your own for the rest of the 50 hour journey unless you get a coop partner or go through some guides on the internet dark souls boasts a great online system that originates from its spiritual predecessor demon souls one that was revolutionary when it came out you can invade other peoples world like literally their own game world just like they can invade yours but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances you can also allow other people to summon you to their world so you can help them fight tough bosses or protect them from other players who invaded their world dark souls has covenants which are ingame clans different covenants has different attributes you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it dark souls online system is great but its connectivity issues are still poor as of today but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun the story of the game wont be told to you directly you wont get cutscenes where npcs tell you stuff and action scenes occur no thats now how it is youll learn the story through character dialogues item informations the appearence of an area and boss battles yes boss battles gives you a great deal of story you learn why their fighting you aside from demons no enemy in the game is actually a villian theyre fighting you for their own reasons dark souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay a lot of people say that the gameplay is broken but if you play it for some time youll understand how beautifully crafted it really is you can perform so many movesets no other game that ive played has such a thing to kick to jump attack to jump to parry backjump to roll to attack with your right or left hand to heavy attack with your right or left hand to block to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage to backstab to use bows crossbows magics apply magical effect on your weapon and many more so many elements its literally the perfect gameplay for me it feels so real and so technical when you defeat a tough enemy or a boss you feel like the best dude there ever lived like youve achieved human perfection thats how satisfying the gameplay really is its simply magnificent totally worth buying truly worth playing,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,personal rating must own instant classic traditional rating 9510 this game currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and video games in general dark souls storywise is whats considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a find it yourself and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in its design it drops you in a huge expansive world where you as the chosen undead are tasked to braving the world of lordran to either save or destroy an age i personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever and is one thats mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards the game starts you out at an asylum as you escape from it the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from at the time being as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the character creator what you do with this information here will carry out through the entire game as soon as you defeat the boss and escape the asylum your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go youre given a goal ring two bells and thats it its up to you to find out why and what for the game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses this also holds true to bosses there are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them after you kill an enemy you collect their souls that save as the games style of currency that is used to not only level up but to buy items weapons etc as well enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be the world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further reinforces the figure it yourself type of story pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on from villages to rotting bridges to an area mostly populated by dragons to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim theres no shortage of level design to be found here and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way as you make your way to the nearest bonfires checkpoint system for the game the leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything what the game wont tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat 50 generally those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways these stats are essential to building a certain character similar to an mmo by leveling up a stat like intelligence for example youll be building up a mage like building up a stat like strength or dexterity will most likely build a melee style character theres no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day as far as the online multiplayer goes this game has one of the most inventive systems in place if your character is undead you cannot summon other people or npc phantoms to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded invasion is in my opinion what makes a game like dark souls the game it is invasion is when another player and in some cases an npc comes into your world sporting a dark red aura in certain other cases a dark blue aura and attempt to kill you as well as you can invade another players world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire while human is when you can be invaded or invade others and summon other players or npcs theres a bunch more details to this game i could go on and on about but if youre reading this youre most likely either looking to continue supporting dark souls or buy it if you havent bought this game and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance get this game it sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons its a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure a,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,before i played dark souls lt l after i played dark souls 7 edit this game is fantastic so thats why i nominated it for the 2016 blew me away award on steam and so i can fully get the new fancy badge,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls perhaps more than any other game on the market is preceded by a reputation from its ultraimposing ultraintimidating bosses to the alienating community mantra of git gud to the games own subtitle of prepare to die the message seems clear this game is hard and youre going to die a lot the reality is thankfully quite a bit more complex than that while dark souls seems destined to make an appearance on nearly every most difficult games list ever compiled to place a disproportionate focus on some sort of perceived insatiable sadism is to sell the game far far short of what it truly has on offer consider the whole picture and its little surprise that the souls series has essentially spawned an entirely new subgenre unto its own at its core dark souls is a game that demands to be respected every step you take every swing of your sword every swig of lifegiving estus is subject to an assessment of risk new players quickly learn that while sharp reflexes dont hurt its caution calculation and preparation that make the difference between victory achieved and the infamous you died buttonmashing and facerolling will only see you sent back to the last bonfire but with a bit of patience and a cool head youll realize that towering demons and sevenheaded serpents arent quite so scary after all for as much respect as this game requires of the player it returns it in kind save for a select portion or two of the game where it seems to momentarily forget that its not actually part of the uncharted series fights are fair and frustration is shockingly minimal while i wont go so far as to suggest that no death is ever the games fault i will say that this game emanates a general ethos of measured punishment believe it or not dark souls honestly does want you to succeed it goes to great lengths to ensure that with enough observation adaptation and perseverance you will always have at your disposal every tool necessary to do so even when your situation initially looks hopeless in addition to its punishingyetrewarding gameplay there really is a lot to love about dark souls for a game of few conversations and fewer cutscenes its lore is surprisingly deep while some exposition does exist as a more direct means of worldbuilding much of it must be pieced together through a combination of lorebearing items and reasonable inferences made about the world around you much of the game follows a similar philosophy of content delivery where there is always something new for particularlyastute players to discover to this point the game is perfectly content to allow even entire portions of the game world to be passed right by if a player doesnt happen to stumble upon them by chance or by wiki level design for as much as levels exist at all in this game is another area in which dark souls stands headandshoulders above the competition whereas many games seem to be satisfied with horizontal expanses of isolated chunks of content dark souls has crafted an intricatelyinterconnected and startlinglyvertical world during the course of my own playthrough it was not uncommon for me to be suddenly taken aback at the realization that the passage i had just discovered had opened up an alternative route back to a previouslyvisited location often in a surprising and pleasantly unexpected way enemy design is varied and interesting few games have so effectively inspired within me such a mixture of wonder awe and intimidation as this game has with its enemies especially with its area bosses combine this with the fact that each boss has its own dedicated and often hauntinglybeautiful audio track playing in the background as you take them on and boss fights tend to be as mesmerizing as they are terrifying the way that dark souls implements its multiplayer is particularly interesting rather than a discrete mode of play multiplayer is integrated directly into the core game players broadcast messages to the greater community by placing them into the environment like graffiti on a wall through certain actions with the aid of specific items a player may even find themselves directly crossing paths with other players themselves for better or for worse without even leaving their own play session as far as im aware all of this is or at least was at one point completely unique to dark souls now because i feel as though ive done nothing but gush about this game since my fingers hit the keyboard i must note that there are of course flaws as i mentioned there are a few encounters in this game that feel rushed and cheap and some that feel as though they would be more at home in a highoctane actionadventure game a number of enemies are obvious nearcarbon copies of one another with differing coats of paint some latter segments of the game suffer from level design that just doesnt stand up to what youve come to expect of it by those points while the games systems are generally refreshingly handsoff with regards to mechanical indoctrination they can at times feel unnecessarily opaque to the point where youll be tempted to keep your web browser open to the dark souls wiki in the background while you play finally because no dark souls pc review would be complete without this mention some light thirdparty modding is borderlinenecessary here the ubiquitous dsfix is such for a reason as the game constitutes a pretty lackluster pc port frame rate improvements a wider array of video resolutions and a number of other graphical and performancerelated options are likely to add immensely to ones enjoyment of this fantastic game what else can i say about this game what else has already been said a thousand times over if this game sounds at all intriguing to you especially if youre somebody who has shied away due to its menacing persona id urge you to try it anyway with a bit of can do attitude you may surprise yourself at your ability to push through a steep learning curve to uncover an experience that makes you feel rewarded in ways that most other games seem almost afraid to do play this game and you may find that most other games just dont quite do it for you anymore if youve found yourself onthefence about purchasing give dark souls a fair shot believe it or not itll do the same for you to anybody who enjoyed this review consider checking out the following commentary video by matthewmatosis its sixandahalf hours long but i found it quite informative and insightful and it inspired my own review pretty heavily if youre a big dark souls fan like myself you might find

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls has a reputation for difficulty git gud they say but its not that dark souls is necessarily difficult more that it has a steep learning curve it can be intimidating for newcomers as it was for me when i first played it i got as far as gaping dragon and hit what i thought was a brick wall so i shelved it for nearly two years with the release of dark souls 3 i thought i needed to give the original another chance boy am i glad that i did this time i had encouragement and some determination again i struggled at the beginning fck this game being uttered on more than one occasion but then it suddenly clicked i dont know what it was perhaps i genuinely started to get better at the game perhaps i upgraded my first weapon but i know that by the time i encountered gaping dragon again i knew this time that i would succeed first attempt fist pump that feeling when you beat something youd considered a massive difficulty spike theres nothing quite like it and dark souls serves them up on a regular basis it gives you such a sense of achievement its like a drug but its not all about combat dark souls rewards exploration not just with trinkets but with real tangible benefits those holy crap i cant believe i just found this awesome thing kind of benefits its a remarkable game the level design is inspired ok there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little tacked on the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent and it grabbed me so hard i could think of little else for the few weeks i was playing it absolutely grab dsfix which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps its easy to implement and dont be afraid to ask people for help its almost a requirement that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face even now may 2016 theres still plenty of multiplayer activity people willing to help messages to guide you and the occasional invader to challenge you it just feels right gush gush gush yes i know but i dont care because dark souls really is that good once it grabs you what oh yeah ok i should shouldnt i ok just because its you dark souls praise the sun t,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls is an action role playing game developed by fromsoftware and published by namco bandai games releasing in 2011 on the console market and 2012 on the pc this is the second game in the souls series the original game demons souls was never released on the pc format the series is set in a dark fantasy universe game play in dark souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play whilst this is true the games difficulty is also fair at the same time with the game relying primarily on the players skill rather than how they are geared and what level they are at the start of the game you get your character creation segment you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like choosing options such as sex appearance name and class you play the game in a third person perspective you have access to tons of different weapons and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting souls this is the games currency system as well as experience points the combat system in dark souls is one of the games most positive features with system that is easy to grasp but pretty hard to become a master of with a lot of enemies having different attack routines you are never quite sure how you should react should you dodge this attack should i parry this attack am i just outright dead dark souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know you will diea lot graphically dark souls upon released looked like your typical ps3 release by todays standards it would be considered very dated thankfully with the game being on pc we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game tenfold if you arent a fan of modding games then the graphical side of dark souls may be something which puts you off a little with low quality textures and an even worse resolution cap in place with mods not only can you make the game look beautiful but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps dark souls has some really good sound tracks too and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters something just doesnt sound right about them whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie i am not sure but there is something very different about the voice acting in dark souls the game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in there are no loading screens or levels if you have the balls you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game thats one of the games really difficult parts making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies equipment vendors and loot the game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route as you can see from my play time on dark souls 73 hours is a lot in fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game your first play through souls will probably take you about 30 hours depending on how you are with the combat system beating this game is no easy feat and when you finish it you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully there is also a large amount of replay ability factored into dark souls you can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class technically on pc dark souls released in a poor state thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed first of all dont even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights the most important mod you will need to make dark souls playable on pc is dsfix which can be downloaded here httpwwwnexusmodscomdarksoulsmods19 the mod is very easy to install and configure and there are plenty of tutorials on youtube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod dark souls is a real test of a gamers skill and patience it is difficult but fair at the same time if you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there dark souls will be for you i had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it if you want the full experience of struggle try the game without the use of wikis or guides dark souls will not be for everyone and that is fine but i strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action rpg genre to attempt to beat this game the games regular retail price on steam is 19 99 whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012 you are getting a monster of a title sale season has been known to bring dark souls down to less than 5 though toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6 this is a must play if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up if you would also like to follow my reviews more easily be

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,for the past year or two gaming lost its touch to me i found myself starting up games and getting bored within 10 minutes even new games i just recently purchased i thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old but still i continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling i had when i was 14 the feeling of deep immersion losing myself within the game wanting to find out more and improve myself then this game happpened i heard about dark souls first about 1 year ago mid 2015 nothing about it seemed interesting to me i heard it was incredibly hard the story was confusing and i felt like gaming was past me so about 6 months pass and i hear about the hype of dark souls 3 something about this series now seems intriguing i still pass it off as something im not going to ever play though then it comes out i see all these youtube videos about it people going crazy about how amazing it is alright ive got to at least try one of these games where do i start 60 for a game i dont even think i will like no thanks alright lets see number two 55 for a game im not sure about no thanks once again ah lets check the first after a few minutes of pondering i decide fk it im buying it and here starts my journey im new i dont know what the hell is going on but this game something about it every time i die i want to go further figure out how to fix what i did wrong last its not skyrim its not some boring repetive game its just different nothing like ive ever experienced then after a while a few hours past wait what im actually getting into a game again i want to play more i want to improve my character so i can kill that black knight and get whatever is behind him i want to finally find a new cool piece of armour i want to figure out what the fk is actually happening in this world and where the story is going this is a fking game done right just buy it try it out you wont regret it ignore all the about people saying its insanely difficult scaring you away that is exactly what makes this game fun its a breath of fresh air to me im only 5 hours in and cant wait to keep playing the rest of this series,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,probably the best game ever,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation theres a wildly prevalent belief the games extremely hard people presume the developers from software sat down and looked at the history of videogames cherrypicking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration only to cause perspiration for others ghosts n goblins and battletoads would likely be in there in there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than well than anything you have ever played before this just isnt the case its just misunderstood you see dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of firelink shrine through darkroot garden and onto blighttown is part of the game mechanics part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve you move a few feet meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso you try again make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you you think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option or maybe a longrange effort if so endowed youve learned what not to do now you teach yourself what to do it probably still isnt enough a third fourth thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature each time you died you were that little bit wiser that little bit stronger regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable there was no stopping no waiting just the desperate need to keep on trying learning and eventually succeeding it was incredibly hard work and around the corner theres more to do different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover you have no idea if youre going in the right direction the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger the compulsion is there though its not a hard game see its just a game with a deep longlasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process rather than the end as in the majority of titles today dark souls is essentially a thirdperson elder scrolls game for the selfhating like bethesdas masterful series dark souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet classes to choose from factions to join magical spells to learn a huge world to explore and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find but unlike the elder scrolls dark souls doesnt reward your failures with generous helpings of exp and leveledup abilities and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving dark souls kills you over and over and then punishes you for dying if you want to make the game a little easier grind to improve your character if you dont like it go play skyrim with all the other wimps at its core dark souls is a game about animations you need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion if you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you youll probably get hit if you want to take a swig from your health flask you need to know that your character will take his sweet time leaving himself vulnerable and when you get knocked down your character wont scramble back to his feet hell lie there for a second just tempting bad guys to move in you need to take each enemy type dissect their patterns and figure out what works through trial and error it might be as simple as blocking strafing and attacking when you get the chance or you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield cant handle or use a certain type of magic youre prevented from buttonmashing by your stamina meter which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up the upside when you finally get a hard part right you feel well not good so much but relieved of course theres more to an actionrpg than just the action killing enemies earns you souls which you can spend if you dont lose them first to improve your many attributesand rpg progression is the only way to make this game less difficult youll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor you also earn a resource called humanity which makes you a little less undead allows you to return to your human form and offers a variety of other perks such as the ability to kindle a bonfire bonfires are this games checkpoints and they refill your health flask kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you the visuals are wellcrafted for the most part dark souls offers impressive environments detailed and frightening enemies and fluid animations the creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere too as for the controls theyre easy to get used to but youll definitely want a controller there is a default keyboard configuration but its incredibly clumsy and the developers dont even pretend theres a chance you might use itall the onscreen instructions pertain to the gamepad no you dont press a to pick up items when youre using a wasd movement setup theres ten hours of new content in the prepare to die edition as well making it the definitive version of dark souls theres a new chapter of the story including fresh areas bosses enemies and npcs as i said above most players probably wont finish the gamewhich was up to 100 hours long to begin withso its not that big of a deal that this version has more of it but if youre a hardcore dark souls fan or if youre confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game the prepare to die edition is the way to go a must play,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark soulswhew i just finished and im ready for a review now,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls changed me as a player and as a person but changed me a lot more as a gamer i want to review this masterpiece but im afraid mere words wont do it justice dark souls is an rpg based on a world where humanity lost the right to a final rest as they become undead when death is upon every and each player to adventure itself out of the asylum there are plenty of information about the lore and such around the web but i still feel the need to say that each story has a side and between legends and fables its up to the player to uncover the truth but what truth can be found if not within our selves this is the perspective that i have and its remarkable that to each their own each player must accomplish his own journey to his own path and conclusion dark souls is an open game not only in design but in the paths of the lore where there are plenty of clues and perspectives to guess upon even with such rich detail and character personality its very unique the way youll enjoy them therefore i must focus on something that everyone share as common belief the amazing level design worthy of genius appraisal the areas from undead burg a city collapsed by despair and plague to darkroot garden a fearful and mysterious woods to even the glorious anor londo a beautiful large city covered by the incandescent sun among many others where the design remains bound to a rule of commitment all areas must be connected and they generally are through a well placed shortcut all levels look like a new challenge but they end up making a certain sense where the player can only admire how well done they are such a logical and practical path makes advances in the game so much fun and entertaining each area is covered with a atmosphere that marks the player and it marked me in ways i cant entirely describe its an overwhelming feeling acquired by the details of light flora and even sounds as everything above wasnt enough we have another well common appreciation the gameplay dark souls is in my opinion the game with the best character movement of all times i know its pretty arrogant to claim this but i never experienced anything so complete so responsive so detailed so so good of course there are issues at times but this is a game after all its not a science dark souls is an abstract game when comes to ingame beliefs and theories but its almost pure science when moving and fighting the controls feel natural and extremely responsive attacking blocking parrying casting magic everything makes me feel so special even more when enemies are down anyone that enjoys defeating bosss will love dark souls and those who dont will start to the game being hard isnt a lie its tough but i found it to be more obtuse when come to use specific items i believe this is no issue as old games use to be like this especially a game made for consoles where players use a controller its not an issue to me like i stated using the correct set up and leveling up on the right attributes can make you extremely strong and break the game but even so i found this to be the real challenge enemies are vast and committed to making you suffer but this brings me to another important thing that make dark souls one of the best games ever the community i never in my life experienced such a strong loyal and helpful community like the dark souls fans its impressive how steam forums are filled with such kind users and ready to help everyone this to me is fascinating because i dont think dark souls can be hard anymore not when there are members dedicated to help and assist others marvelous to end i must say dark souls really changed me it made me earn resistance patience and made me respect my foes but mostly my own problems and life struggles i made friends which i still talk to and overall i feel i earn so much from this game i cant stress enough how dark souls really are one of my favorite games of all times thank you from software and thank you everyone that helped me improve in this fantastic game and teach me the ways of the sun,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls prepare to dye edition is the latest installment in a series of family games by critically acclaimed developer from software in it you take on the role of a young italian painter by the name of adriano abato on his quest to restore color to the world and solve the mystery of why it was lost to begin with adriano is joined by his talking pet dog francesco who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor however and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help adriano return color to the world gameplay 810 the goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush the more of the world that is restored this way the closer to solving the mystery adriano gets while it is not necessary to repaint 100 of the world there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so the gameplay is split into four phases in the first phase adriano and francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors its up to the player to decide where to go first but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others decide for yourself what you feel capable of but try to challenge your creative spirit in the second phase adriano must find the three prime colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings the three different colors are yellow blue and red yellows will usually aid adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun but in some cases adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first blues can be troublesome particularly if adriano hasnt restored a lot of churches yet in most cases they will give adriano a puzzle to solve the difficulty of which depends on how much of the worlds color has already been restored the most troublesome color by far is red the reds will often say meanspirited things to poor adriano and try to ruin his paintings they can be difficult to deal with but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from francesco adriano will eventually be able to prevail in the third phase adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world here accuracy speed and the number of colors collected is important if adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world and if he is too slow the colors might get impatient and escape again the fourth phase is only unlocked after adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the worlds color i wont spoil the details of this phase but its quite intense there is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible there are some connectivity issues on the pc version but with a bit of patience it shouldnt be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun i give this game an 810 for the gameplay which is both fun and addictive the competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world story 710 prepare to dye does not have a very complex storyline but it doesnt need one either its a family game for casual painting fun and the plot reflects this its simple enough that a child can grasp it but even adults will appreciate the tale of adriano in the monochrome world the twist at the end will also likely surprise most players even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game this is only obvious in retrospect however i give the story a 710 because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done it suits the game and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously its a story anyone can jump into and enjoy characters 610 the primary characters are adriano and francesco adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile his optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world francesco his talking dog is similar to his owner in many ways but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over adrianos head nonetheless the player wont be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes the personalities of the colors are not particularly complicated and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above there are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to wouldbe players while the characters are quite endearing i cant give this section more than 610 there is little in the way of character development and there isnt a lot of character variation controls 410 dark souls prepare to dye edition was ported from the nintendo wii to pc and as a port it does have some issues the original game relied heavily on the wiimotes motion control for the painting parts of the game and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on pc its difficult to play the game as intended on pc and many blame the rushed release of the pc version for this there are mods to fix the controls but despite this i cant really give the game more than a 410 for the controls as they are by default while the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the pc they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls rather than rushing the port like they did graphics 710 as i already mentioned the game was ported from the nintendo wii and the port is less than ideal this can also be seen in the graphics as the game doesnt support resolutions a pc player would consider acceptable while this too can be fixed with mods it should still be considered a problem with the port resolutions aside the game itself is absolutely gorgeous the haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world while the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison they suit the overall atmosphere of the game in many ways they resemble characters from a childrens picture book despite the issues with resolutions i give the graphics a 710 the low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous with mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on steam sound 810 from software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes and prepare to dye is certainly no exception to this rule in the monochrome world the music is somber but as color is restored to the world the music grows livelier and more colorful as well once color is fully restored the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment its like an auditory representation of the canvas adriano restored to life the voice acting is a bit cheesy however the stereotypical italian accents of adriano and francesco get more endearing once you get used to it but the fact that the colors and the other npcs have standard american accents is a bit offputting that said the voice acting cant pull down the overall sound score too much as dialogue is not very important in prepare to dye the music speaks more for the game than the voices do and so i give the game an 810 for sound conclusion 710 overall i give this game a 710 while it has many issues its a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer i highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,best modern military shooter ive ever played,1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,its like dark souls 2 except its good,1,1
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,i have to admit that i avoided dark souls for an unhealthy amount of time rarely playing games above the normal difficulty the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasnt the most compelling im glad i changed my mind though because i may have had missed out on a game i now consider one of the best of the decade the gameplay is fun and engaging the art hauntingly beautiful and original the soundtrack breathtaking but what really makes dark souls a masterpiece by perfectly uniting all its elements is the world of lordran its cohesive design made me question every videogame world id experienced up to that point from the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle the worlds vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow after transversing the map not too many times i could and still can months after actively playing the game definitely draw a convincing transcription of it with all its shortcuts and intersections in a journey through lordram rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused dark souls has no narrative there are no quests maps or journals what it has is the world of lordran the story is presented to the player through unusual elements item descriptions npcs that have their own agenda and most importantly through the other main elements of the game music visuals gameplay you are never given a codex or anything like what most rpgs have you have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses its just as fun as is taking part in the clever and unique coop and pvp elements to top it all off the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched but that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long a mustplay if ive ever seen one dark souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,the first and arguably the best pros great replay value good dlc included in the game complex and rich storyline solid character progression and progress rewards still provides a solid challenge at most levels cons still requires dsm fix and other external addons to allow for proper gameplay with a keyboard dsm conectivity mod still basically a requirement for online play some covenant acheivements are now very difficult due to either long farming or slow online grinding with a low player base kill the dogs first,1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,dark souls is a hard game at first its oppresive its relentless its punishing and it wont hold your hand you will be confused and you will die so prepare to die yet as you progress through the game youll get the hang of it after dying time and time again youll learn how to tell if an enemy is going to attack you and how powerful that attack will be youll learn faster routes to get to your objective and youll learn to detach yourself from the souls you get you will lose them the point isnt to constantly grind the point is to learn and while a couple hundreds souls will be an awful lot during early game by the end you can farm tens thousands of them in a couple of minutes take your time be patient its mostly about the journey and the elation youll feel when overcoming the obstacles the insurmountable odds against you the unbreakable barrier youll die and then youll learn and then you will achieve victory so praise the sun,1,0

211820,Starbound,for people who like story or fast reactionbased gameplay this game isnt for you with over 200 hours on this game i have come to a conclusion you dont play this game for the end goal of saving the universe you play this game for the journey it takes you on i realised this when i was playing with friends and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game if a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable it has to be doing something right 1010 hands down,1,1
211820,Starbound,see my hours i know this game and i know that i say its by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one congrats chucklefish if i could give a neutral review i would consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive im still going to lay it down on you after spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned they didnt and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates i would by lying if i said i didnt at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by chucklefish after all its not the money we paid but the promises we paid for development is slow very slow pros you will probably spend at least 100gt hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet yes its like pokemon but in space procedurally generated weapons very good ones too you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs building is easy wiring is easy painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations 7 starter races that are diverse and unique modding support for this game is well maintained near infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings multiplayer through steam easy to connect via the client can be very laggy professions are chosen by the player you can play how you want however some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others the farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has ost is amazing active devs who also listen a fair bit to the community might even find them in the discord or iirc customizability is insane akin to terrarias system including dyes and social slots liquid and light dynamics are realistic supports abc files you can play actual music in game from websites such as lotro boss fights are uniqueish semicons things that the devs are likely to fix soon or will fix eventually or may not be encountered by everyone can feel a bit solitary especially in singleplayer game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 10 cons ai can be pretty stupid the story is average and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons for their level some are incredibly weak or easy or very hardop the tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss applies mainly to beta players if you played in beta you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses penguin crewmates are a pain in the no ship protection in multiplayer besides farming there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base mining can get boring quickly especially if you are used to terrarias systems game has a falloff point where you sit down and go well what next but that is quite some time later some mechanics seem halfbaked where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there some bad design choices and flaws starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated seriously the biggest con for this game are just design flaws like the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely you will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head why didnt they do instead techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring only 6 tiers come on where is the 10 we had before so what are ship pets for there exactly they do like to stand in front of my containers options screen needs a bit of a rework if you need to explain a ui its not a good ui wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks matter manipulator customization is a joke any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still people are divided between simply party with people you trust and just give us some bloody protection options personally protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit edit after some more thought ship protection options should just be a thing honestly the existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are not everyone will be a decent or honest person okay lets clear this up starbound is not a terraria copy yes it does have elements and inspired features that terraria did but honestly whats the wrong in that imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game youve ever played terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps tiers are an iffy one they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones ranged melee and staffs on top of that where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes they totally disappeared in a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do this doesnt just mean a million different blocktype just give us some more depth and flexibility should clarify technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one last time i played this game on a server with friends we didnt mine explore pvp build or do quests we all sat in a ship and played guess the song if that isnt simultaneously the most concerning gameplay wise but coolest thing then what the hell is it the games development could be described as a mix of one step forward two steps back and missed opportunities because the thing is its easily playable but frustrating removed score decided it wasnt a good choice worth the money yes runs on most computers no as of right now 10 which harbors some optimization problems honestly i want to love starbound i really do to me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities 25716 top review didnt expect gonna add a little morealso edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings if anyone from chucklefish reads this what are you doing this game is confusing because it obviously has potential and lives up to some of it but falls short at the silliest of things look at some community mods and ideas people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked when you make a game it wont be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too you added skyrails and some other features hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example the modular matter manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization i dont want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms i would hate for this to be another let the modders deal with it all that being said good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i wont discount that word limit,1,1
211820,Starbound,playtime and timemoney,1,1
211820,Starbound,i last reviewed this in 2014 when the game was in early beta it was really bad ive come back now that 10 has released to see if the game is better this review was earlier incomplete during a 10 playthrough but after playing about 70 hours total of the release version my feelings have not changed only worsened i couldnt even push myself to complete the story i searched it up and found it was more dissapointing then i could have expected making me actually glad i didnt go through it the rest of the review has been slightly modified but only slightly i preordered this as soon as it became available and have been watching it for 5 years i wanted this game to be great so is it good is it bad its ok the game has some value to it now the building is fairly entertaining providing a lot of options for furniture and ways to progress through it with farmingcolonies as well combat has a good deal of variety and the bosses are pretty decent there is a lot of variety in weapon types later in the game the story missions are pretty good in design and hold a lot of nice secrets the fossil collecting minigame is a fun distraction as well thats unfortunately where things fall off to being either poor or outright bad the exploration is awful the biomes are devoid of content minus some rare biome chests and thats how all of the biomes work enter biome look for chest hope it has an interesting blueprint you cant craft anything of note from the biomes until luck does you well alongside that there are procedural buildings throughout planets in the form of rooms and dungeons they are sadly all handmade meaning you will constantly find the same exact roomsdungeons while playing i never went through a biome underground without finding at least 3 of the same exact room it was often 5 though as a result of this lack of variety lack of reward and really a lack of anything else to look for exploration dies rapidly every planet is mostly the same and they can be grouped into a few categories normal planet ocean barren moon and possibly asteroid the story is also terrible collect the 6 special artifacts done its badly written and the lore is lacking in every way if you know any of the source materialtheme concepts cavemen for floran 1984 for apex aztecinca for avian etc then the lore and story will not branch to any interesting point whatsoever it all feels very generic weapon generation is also bad melee only has damage firerate and element though 2 handed weapons have an extra special attack ranged is the same though it has energy cost as well there are also staveswands but they just change damage into level a less varying stat the weapons themselves are nice to use but the lack of statistical variance means the procedural nature of weapons feels entirely pointless cooking potions but there arent a lot of unique buffs you can get crew members for your ship but they arent useful past the first few tiers and they otherwise do extremely little the toolbar is a mess crafting takes time for no apparent reason procedural quests send you to the same areas revealing the way the system works damaging play experience and providing lackluster repetition as well there arent many actual quest types colonist rewards are lacking and serve only as an alternative to normal play for getting items as well the thoughts and traits of colonists actually seem to do nothing in my experience character gear options consist of only 4 armor slots a passive augment and movement abilities customization is thus very limited in terms of character build depth there arent any passive gear slots other than the single augment which are all very basic armor is also very lacking there arent very many unique sets with most being reskins and they lack any notable special effects not to mention a lot of things from beta like character customization options and techs have been removed and well i could go on but after all that i still dont think the game is terrible its just lacking badly i focused on the negatives a lot but those negatives are a huge part of the game its a jack of all trades master of none kind of ordeal but its not bad i wouldnt recommend it unless it is on sale with exceptions if you like animal crossing or relaxed games about collecting and freeform building like minecraft mixed in with animal crossing i think youll like it but id say pick it up on a sale say 5 i was enjoying it for awhile based on the building and fossil hunting but the rest of the game being so shallow pushed me to leave eventually as well i can say with certainty that my enjoyment value dropped rapidly over time it wasnt even 10 hours in before i was watching youtube videos on the side to distract myself and i only realised as of my last jump into the game that i wasnt having any fun at all and it was just time killing due to how long it takes to find things the game may be long but it is not deep im sure some will find enjoyment out of this but it died quickly for me so i reccomend it only if you are into that type of gameplay and only on a sale as on the slip side if you want a game about fighting loads of different enemies finding unique interesting gear discovering a strange path through progression or exploring exciting places you are likely going to be very disappointed i personally hope for the sake of everyone playing including myself that they take the terraria style of updating and add massive swaths of content after release to fix these issues but thats all i can do hope with a similar development time of 56 years as terraria has had due to terrarias year hiatus in 2012 i dont know how much will change at this rate,-1,1
211820,Starbound,a very enjoyable game about exploration where you can do lots of stuff like build a housevillage with the choice to have people move in explore the galaxy do countless fetch quests for villagers kill bad guys battle monsters be a guy who is basically a star dressed as a cowboy hunt become a superhuman through techs find weapons use said weapons complete the main quest ignore the main quest until you need to get some gear from it watch fish people be openly racist about plant people escape from earth on a ship farm mine have fun in general play multiplayer its like no mans sky but 2d and from what i hear better,1,1
211820,Starbound,ive got two copies of this game one for me and one for my son i only play this game with him so my review is based on what its like as a dad playing this game with my kid i made a workbench my son stole it i found a treasure chest my son ninjad the content my son asked me to help him fight some aliens then abondoned me and left me to die i built a 4 story treehouse my son destroyed it i mined deep down into the planet leaving a trail of torches so i could find my way back to the surface my son took the torches away leaving me alone in the dark i made a coffee my son bumped it over my keyboard after alls said and done though its a really fun game to play together,1,1
211820,Starbound,no mans sky but 2d better multiplayer,1,1
211820,Starbound,its like no mans sky and terraria had a baby but then no mans sky cheated on terraria eventually that baby became awesome and the father is in prison architect 1010 cnn news,1,1
211820,Starbound,i have played starbound since its early access days and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox explorationbuilding genre among the games of its genre starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting rather than adventuring in a single world in starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards so you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit which makes exploration very addictive you will always want to explore just one more planet in regard of building starbound offers one of largest if not the largest selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base it also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many npc as you like potentially building a whole town with dozens residents and uniquely among its genre starbound also has quests like one might expect of a rpg rather than a sandbox building game a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by npc in towns or those youve placed in your home or base yourself only one aspect of starbound is somewhat lacking combat or specifically its difficulty while you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped especially at the very start as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife there is some difficulty during boss fights but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go and if you expect challenging battles that terrarria or action games offer you wont find them in starbound some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements like flamethrowers or laser beams not enemies in fact random dungeons often have few to none enemies and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment so overall the combat isnt that bad just dont expect constant challenge that terraria or edge of space present i fully recommend starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try,1,1
211820,Starbound,as someone whos been with starbound since it entered open beta i can say that this game is simply put the best 2d sandbox game ive ever played picture this an open vast universe with 4something quadrillion planets each unique in their own ways there are seven unique playable races each with a rather vast ammount of lore behind them i was a bit worried when the developers said they would be adding a storyline but im sure glad they did the storyline serves to direct the player and encourage exploration there are plenty of weapons to destroy your enemies with each type having several special stats if you like terraria i highly reccomend this game,1,1

211820,Starbound,video games dont exist in a bubble they dont exist independently from their makers when theyre as horrifically unfinished as starbound the game itself is deceivingly shallow having a huge lack of content especially compared to terraria on top of a lack of content it has tons of issues that still arent fixed it has been months without a substantial update for a game that they swore would be released in 2013 httpsiimgurcomj1zhrobpng on top of that the developers and moderators have taken to blaming the community for their disappointment httpsiimgurcomm3jblk8png httpsiimgurcom2zjax3qpng theyve gone so far as to blame vote brigading for negative steam reviews httpsiimgurcom91tgomepng httpsiimgurcomyy0umkzpng and of course they dont want you to get refunds anymore httpsiimgurcomsdgmkympng httpsiimgurcomeghvklcpng dont waste your money buy something else and dont support rotten indie developers,-1,1
211820,Starbound,its incredible how much content the game has,1,1
211820,Starbound,i was promised space and i got space 1010,1,1
211820,Starbound,tldr at the bottom look at the most popular reviews for starbound and 90 of them are negative even though the overall review is 89 positive while many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game i do not think they are giving starbound enough credit starbound is space terraria i do not think it is fair to compare starbound and terraria yes they are both 16bit adventuresandbox games but each plays very differently terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun starbound is about the experience this game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story each game is fun in its own way on a side note i actually like the combat in starbound a bit better terrarias combat is too arcadey for me but that is the appeal of the game for some people progression is too fast i got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed i would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system now many people feel that progression is too easy there is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time interesting things have been removed i agree with this to some extent a while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger i was sad because i really liked hunger but they added hunger back the devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it sure a lot of cool content was removed but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added ship upgrading the outpost new combat mechanics etc yeah some cool things have been removed but far more ccol things have been added most importantly there is something called modding if you want temperature back someone has made a mod for it chucklefish has a vision for their game they felt like starbound did not need temperature so they removed it if you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better you can add it modding is not meant to fix the game but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes in the end i think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right and starbound doesnt deserve that does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16bit graphics very few yes the game needs critizism every game does that is what allows a game to become better just remember that this game can be a great experience if you dont just focus on the bad tldr this game has issues but it also has many great things to offer look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game edited to clarify my comments about modding,1,1
211820,Starbound,this game ended up being surprisingly stale they cut a massive amount of functioning content that made the game more entertaining leaving the game with little to stand on compared to its predecessor or other games in its genre the weapons are overbalanced and stratified magic is a joke swords can attack in a combo but they get a huge delay afterwards if you do all melee weapons are around the same level of slow etc all the interesting flying and movement options are removed the morphball is the only surviving relic of this stuff but its useless and is never necessary out of dungeons and because it lacks any special abilities all you do is move through tiny holes with it like how hard would it have been to make it drop a little energy bomb to solve switch puzzles or something the main questline requires you just running through same styled planets and clicking on furniture until you luck out enough to be able to play a dungeon this could happen on your first try or only be possible after around 5 hours of gameplay going through towns and planets per quest the worst part of this is the game used to have interesting and fun content there used to be more than one reason to go to a moon there used to be fun flying techs and movement modifications weapons used to attack in reasonably diverse ways and actually good ones used to exist but all this functional and fun stuff that people enjoyed from early access was taken out the only reason i could see seeing as how all the stuff worked and was finished is that they wanted these things to fit in the game like they wanted the morph ball to be useful so they designed dungeons and levels with holes small enough to require it but if say someone had a jetpack then any dungeon with a jumping puzzle would be trivialized thing is they still have jumping techs in the game because the meat of the game is still exploration so you still can cheat at jumping puzzles just not to the same extent so in addition to failing there this also means that you will never really be able to explore as easily as you want to because the meat of the game is crippled by the devs inability to work around flight mechanics when designing pointless single item drop puzzle rooms this games skeleton is still a metroidvania and do you know what metroidvanias arent beloved for platforming and balanced combat few people played castlevania symphony of the night and then commented wow i hate the crissaegrim magic and being a bat climbing this tower while fighting the 800 medusa heads that spawned should have been way more tedious for me the changes made seem to reflect the devs desire to make the game feel whole on release no loose or frayed ends and with mechanics at least loosely fitting in with what theyve done but the aspects of the gameplay they sought to preserve by removing content are the least palatable parts of the game and now were stuck in a crippled snoozefest in summary the devs goofed with their decisionmaking and the game has suffered for it its a space game throw in black hole guns giant orbital beam cannons jetpacks lazer swords that can attack rapidly and in huge arcs put in nukes that can unexist whole planets either yielding huge mineral rewards or releashing eldritch terrors i need to fight with my ship throw in short range blink teleportation that doesnt suck make light not be an issue for god sakes i know the monster hunter logic of the more we cripple the player the more mechanics we can have to uncripple them and that makes sense for that game but were in space for christs sake all suits would have a light on them and theres enough other things going on that this wouldnt be missed put in high gravity planets put in planets with poisonous food so you need to stock up throw in floating sky cities that hover on high density gas planetsreal scientific possibilty for venus colonization or at the very least just put back in some of the fun that was removed the game as it stands is you double jumping around samey rocks while swinging a sword one time a second and clicking alien pots to get to the next dungeon all other content is either nigh pointless or removed and whats left is boring ps this is reposted from a community discussion,-1,1
211820,Starbound,im going to keep this short and sweet and get straight to the point if youre expecting terraria in space or some form of a terraria clone in anyway dont buy the game because you will be disappointed starbound is to terraria as tf2 is to overwatch meaning while they look very similar in visual style and gameplay theyre nothing alike stop comparing the two if youre expecting something thats a bit more metroidvania styled in gameplay and looking for a game more focused on exploration this game is for you if you have grown bored of terraria and want a new 2d expereience this game is for you if youre not a fan of building and want a home right off the bat this game is for you do note the story is great but the scan quests suck you can skip them via admin commands there are several guides on how to skip the scanning quests i do wish the developers would add more techs especially ones that enable flight and unique movement boosts same with vehicles if you dislike certain aspects of the game the workshop is your best friend and usually patches most of the problems you may have while many vanillaists complain that the workshop shouldnt be responsible for fixing things the develeopers failed theyre not really patches or fixes but more so useful tweaks and additions do note that anything that add blocks or recipes to the game will break your character once uninstalled one thing i suggest is to disable vsync browse local files go inside of the storage folder in the file starboundconfig set it to false itll massively improve the fps theres definitly room for optimizations though especially on windows overall i love this game ive enjoyed playing it so far and i do hope the devs improve certain aspects of this game given that they have an unstable branch for testing the game and the newest patch is alright so far id if i were going off the negative reviews alone theyre slowly getting back on the right track,1,1
211820,Starbound,i liked this game back when it first came out on steam when 10 came out i figured i might enjoy it again that wasnt the case a lot of content was cut and even exploration feels much more bland and stale temperature system has been removed this was one of the nice features back during the beta most clothing had function snow infantry set was very useful and it felt very relaxing sitting by a fire on a snow planet so you could warm up sectors have been removed you used to only be limited in exploration by the temperature system and how warm or cool you could get a forest planet in a sector would be just as dangerous as a lava planet on that same sector and you would find the same resources on every planet in that sector until you moved on to the next one this was a favorite feature of mine and really enhanced exploration because there was just as much incentive to going to the forest planet as the lava planet most techs are gone i remember all the vehicle and flying techs and how youd have to find them to actually use them now that i cant use my bubble tech i have to build giant pillars to get on avian pirate ships and this isnt all there was also a mech and some other vehicles the only surviving tech vehicle is the boat only now you have to waste pixels buying it instead of being incentivized to explore to find it randomly generated monsters and weapons have been removed i enjoyed this because it added to exploration and had you wondering what kind of creatures and crazy weapons youd find on a planet youd land on every creature was unique and every weapon was unique down to the name and function this also added a lot of fun to exploration because of course you wouldnt know what youre going to find story isnt that great i honestly had more fun back when youd build the bosses yourself in order to advance to the next sector and unlock more equipment and crafting tables i thought the beginning of the story was fine but the rest felt repetative and boring find a settlement and scan objects gets very annoying and i tend to just drift away from the story altogether i have yet to face the final boss because of this plenty of weapons and armor have been cut and i dont mean the randomized ones you used to find on planets i mean weapons and armor you crafted at tables copper and gold almost seem to have no use anymore and i quite enjoyed those armors as bad as they were and copper armor and weapons were easily obtained in the early game allowing you to take on more dangerous things it felt like i was legitimately getting stronger and every ore had a use almost any type of weapon could be made from any type of ore feel like making daggers no problem spears yep instead now there are too few craftable armors and weapons and it seems ores have gotten even more scarce further cuts include certain dungeons uscm bases are a prime example and you can no longer attack npcs unless you break all their stuff if i want to be a murderous psychopath and purge xenos just let me do it please on top of all that theres little reason to go to moons or asteroids anymore asteroids would be one of the most dangerous biomes in the game with the best resources but now theres pretty much nothing i will repeat i loved this game in 2013 telling people to mod it in is no excuse and its the wrong mentality to show to developers ill change my opinion if some of the good features are added back into the game or some of the many promises chucklefish made are implemented starbound simply feels like half the game it was when it first came out on early access,-1,1
211820,Starbound,edit review addendum for 10 release its official for their grand finale chucklefish has totally ruined starbound they finally settled on one tedious game mechanic and a generic collect all the macguffins plotline for the 10 release then they took all the hit or miss content they had tested and either vetted or removed over the last 3 years carelessly ground it all up and poured the resultant slop over the bland shitcake base game kinda like a chef who mulches an entire thanksgiving dinner into a soup bones and all it seems like they couldnt decide how to properly implement all their old content in the face of the rerereinvented design but rather than let it all go to waste they just hastily rebranded and pasted bits of it everywhere the slurry pulp that used to be sequential mission instances and technology unlocks is now an incomprehensible pile of broken gameplay chunks haphazardly slapped everywhere without reason or direction the result is a horrible disjointed unplayable cluster overflowing with inexplicable changes even when its not suffering from gamebreaking slowdowns and fatal glitches unfortunately this is the mess theyve decided to settle on so this is the mess were stuck with even a dozen brilliant 3rd party user mods aimed at mitigating the damage arent enough to salvage this disaster good older content like the portable pixel printer are gone while ridiculous nonsensical additions were made such as giant unkillable ghosts that haunt every empty moon in the universe why in fact thats the question that best sums up this entire official nonbeta release why beta version review follows i fear starbound will turn out less like disneyland which is a functional masterpiece that will never be finished but constantly improved and more like the winchester house constructed haphazardly and proceeding aimlessly without direction until its owners death the game has a more than decent framework but the developers keep changing the games premise leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential its gone from a terrarialike 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses to a storydriven series of instance dungeons all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished andor unnecessary features this slashandburn development has left the game unfocused long after the point where it should have been crystallizing the initial hype has died down releases are fewer and longer between and content is stagnant for months at a time leaving players wondering if theres any motivation or momentum left to see it completed the playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content in their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game theyre offering a lot of gravy and not much meat players will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests judging from the comments here and at other sites many players have walked away due to the lack of content and with them goes wordofmouth support after all what good is an increasingly graphically refined game world if theres nothing new to do in it,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i got 400 hours out of a game i paid less than 15 dollars for ive played it since early access i have had my character wiped 4 times if that is any indication on how long ive owned it the game has a feel that not many other games have the music is similar to the music of morrowind the weaponscombat remind me of castlevania and the abilities are like the ones you get in metroid or mega man there is an endless galaxy to explore a character to customize from various races colonies to build quests to complete crops to grow a ship to enhance and customize and monsters to capture i think it is very worth the price oh right hoverbikes edit i didnt receive the game for free i have no idea why it says that or how to remove it also the modding community is extremely active and is on steam workshop nexus mods i highly recommend frackin universe and the xs mech mod there are also mods that add in races and their communitiescolonies which are really well done too,1,1
211820,Starbound,okay we should be fair with starbound i will bs nobody first off i am a supporter from back when it was on early access the game has been dramatically changed since then i had to play through the whole game again since my savegame was not compatible with v1 but who cares really so what is starbound well it started as an open world sandbox game keep that in mind please so since then a lot of stuff were added we got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need the game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions to do some essential things the whole tutorial is the lore of the game yup a sandbox with lore as tutorial how do you like that one step before going against the final boss you know you are ready to explore whatever you want what a great idea you also carry a codex where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff like journals stories etc etc very rewarding for readers you can collect various stuff like bugs fish fossils and make collections out of them randomly generated quests occur all the time with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff challenges are available and a lot of stuff to do you can farm you can have your own pets what else can i say about this awesome game oh the world well basically you start on a solar system then you go outside of it to another star stars are solar systems with planets inside them imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map and believe me there are lots of stars full of planets to explore favorite changes for early access users that wanna see whats new a the pixel compressor has no penalty b the fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process c optimized not to lag so lets see graphics 90 fantastic pixel art sound 90 great music but too emotional for my taste still great gameplay 90 it is very polished the game seldom lags even on my old pc replayability value 90 with so many races i bet this can be played many many times value for money 90 i played 300 hours already including the time before v1 was released scenario 70 interesting scenario but thats it ltltlt this is considered an extra on a sandbox game do i recommend this well yes it is a great game just dont take it for an rpg it is a sandbox,1,0
211820,Starbound,910 starbound is a procedurally generated universe where you can plunder endless amounts of dungeons build colonies and mod the out of it its a cute indie with cooperative multiplayer which makes up for its unassuming appearance with the sheer amount of content the developer provides supports and continues to shell out both the pixel art and soundtrack are both easy on your senses creating an immersive atmosphere and inspiring ambience for late night galactic voyages especially fun if you have some friends who want to build a settlement or tag along for an adventure prepare for a timesink,1,1

211820,Starbound,ill be honest here if youve never heard of starbound before and you like the idea of a scifi sandbox survivalish game then youll probably enjoy starbound i however am giving this a thumbs down for reasons i shall go into long ago in the early access days of starbound players glimpsed what was a relatively complete game that was clearly a framework for something greater something complex hidden behind its gridbased constructionmining engine was a surprisingly complex universe complete with six unique races all of which had their own history adversities asthetic style and personality for once it seemed like the characters species was actually going to matter with even the descriptions of food items hinting that different species would have to eat different food which is a very cool idea in a survival game this type of complexity was for me what set starbound apart from other games in the genre it wasnt just a sandbox it was its own world with conflicting cultures and people the earliest sign was that racial bonuses abilities unique to what species your character was was planned to be in the next update these bonuses were later changed to be tied to the races armoursets where wearing the full set head torso leggings of a races armour would confer its bonus this was apparently done for the sake of balance and keeping each of the races equal sure i thought but to this day racial bonuses are still not part of the game starbounds development has been slow very very slow i was ok with this as it was the developers first game and after dabbling in game dev myself i am aware that it can be a very difficult thing to do things were fine at first a slow creep of new assets and features adding more content to the worlds randomgen system etc everything youd expect from an early access title however somewhere during development something changed everyone was hype for the next big update as updates were incredibly rare and itd hit sure there was all this cool new stuff theyd shown off in screenshots but they would always come with a number of gamebreaking bugs that would severely impact gameplay and would sometimes take months to be fixed but the most bizarre part to me was that cf would often just cut assets entirely from the game items furniture gone no explanation given just gone and for a game about exploration collection and building this seemed like a very odd move the last few updates leading up to 10 were the worst offenders at this the previous diversity and characterisation of the games six races were severely stripped away racial weapons and ship ai were removed for seemingly no reason which is very strange considering the racial ai often featured in the games devblog this along with the removalaltercation of several other features the games ui being one of them pushed things over the line for me i had hope i had patience but i look upon the finished product that is the 10 build currently on sale here and cant help but feel utterly disappointed in summary what first appeared to be a surprisingly complex twist on the survival sandbox genre was dumbed down to rush it for release also the game costs 5 less now its nice i paid extra to experience this disappointment there are actually a number of other issues i could go into as to why im giving this a thumbs down from reckless spending to the developers reaction to criticism but this review is already long enough edit since everyone seems to comment on this yes i have 1600 hours played this is because the early access builds had a launcher that was very easy to leave open for long periods of time also i did actually enjoy playing the game however now that 10 has been released many of the things i enjoyed about it have been removed and i am doubtful they will ever be restored hence my negative review,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i dig this game way way more than terraria theres just way more roleplaying potential to a game where you explore the endless universe as opposed to a game where you go right or left i just want to manspread my galactic empire but fine ill specify the finer points that tip the scales for me artstyle is less chibi and more visible i know that sounds like not much of a differrence in a pixel game but its going to have a much bigger merit after hours of gameplay size scaling everything in starbound is visible and more up close whereas terraria seems tiny with a lot of wasted space i dont know if terra scales with monitors but either way the flashlight sounds silly but it makes exploring caves in starbound much more fun you no longer have to spend most of earlygame on putting torches around varied races but thats a given varied worlds but thats a given the main building tool in starbound is much more convenient and versatile but that might be a negative point for people who prefer heavier roleplaying workshop weapons and animations are much better in my opinion there is absolutely no stiffness to attacks building is much better as well you can freely choose between using the same material for either the foreground or the background not only more realistic but more convenient as well the starship hub look at that points,1,1
211820,Starbound,it is a very sad day indeed when the people that play a game know more about what makes it fun than the people that made it i have played starbound from the very beginning before it was an early access game on steam it was awesome the things they had planned for this game the things they had already available for this game was very exiting indeed every time you went to a planet you got a different palette of trees rocks soil water monsters and food they had the promise of different abilities for each race at the very beginning they had a system where you had to build a fire to keep warm until you could muster enough resources to make yourself warm clothes then the combat update came the game they where designing then was very promising indeed sadly most of this stuff has been taken out along the way they lost the vision of the game they had and 10 is what we got a very boring and empty game what the devs fail to understand is that the community was playing the last stable update and loving it look at the ratings all i wanted was a sort of story and lore to be created for the universe i was playing in and that would of been awesome but instead i got 10 a shallow stripped down version of a game that i was promised to top it off its full of awful bugs and optimization problems its funny when you think about it the beta was more stable and more optimized i wish i could uninstall 10 and go back to the last stable version i had more toys to play with in that version my sensei once told me that to be successful you need a posture in life when you do something you have to believe in what your doing and stand by it even when the waters come rushing against it and try to bring it down they should of kept their initial vision the game would have been a lot better i cant recommend this title in its current state im happy that you sold over 60 000 copies since 10s release guys but once the community has a taste of what they bought i dont think your gonna sell much more just look at the new reviews coming in,-1,1
211820,Starbound,a lot of people have been saying this game is like terraria now id like to clear up the misunderstanding here yes maybe with some features gameplay pixel style and 2d side scroller it is like terria but other than that it doesnt feel like terraria at all in fact its better terarria fails to capture the subtle beauty of starbound with its amazing sounndtract and the wonderlust that we all have for space its simplistic at first glance but dives much deeper than youd think it has a story ark for those who like set missions and goals and a certain path they have to follow explorations dominates the game and the world of starbound is ridden with lore each race is whimsical in nature from robots being the ones the least technilogically advanced and flowerpeople being the most carnivorous and ficious species alive for those who like to let creativity soar you can build whatvever your heart desires from tall futuristic buildings scraping the sky to a small wooden cavern laying behind a line of trees and the best of all if youd just like to relax you can always just grab your handy dandy manupilator module and chop some logs or go mining and listen to the tictictic of ores ppopping out of foreground and background alike chill with some friends around a campfire jamming out to 12 days of christmas on your various instruments or team up to find legendary and curiously awesome and even more awesomely named weopons and battle tiny penguins who got their flippers on asault rifles and tanks i dont think starbound strives to be a spesific game it doesnt strive to have an ending either not being able to call it quite a sandbox ill call it an adventure you have to play and experiance for yourself i can never tire of this game and doubt i ever will billions of unique planets creatures species and collectables hover at your fingertips all you have to do is try not to think about scary purple ghosts as you get the fuel to power your spaceship and explores stars across the galaxy starbound is such an unique game putting it into words is both a challenge and an impossible feat i have attempted and failed just know that it is worth every penny and far more and that it is and always will be one of my very favourite games toodles 2dbunnie,1,1
211820,Starbound,ive clocked 380 hours in game ive played vanilla and modded versions ive played through every mission the developers put in the game and all of the missions from frackin universe and yet i keep coming back i keep putting time into this i have spent hours and hours amassing materials and creating multitier gardens with glowing glass walls so i could plant and harvest day and night ive fought cultists and abominations postapocalyptic survivalists and primatives and every other thing inbetween ive committed village massacres and protected stoic swampdwelling frogmen ive sailed seas of acid and alien juice and drifted to the bottom of oceans of liquid nitrogen and ill do it all over again in 10 just to see whats new and to start my dream of settling planets and creating thriving civilizations on them the haunting piano score calls to me if you want to know where i am im ingame protecting the universe,1,1
211820,Starbound,its basically a 2d version of no mans sky with no spaceship piloting but far deeper gameplay elements thats inspired by terarria and minecraft if youre not interested in sandbox survival games as such you can also play the game as a story driven planet exploration game with light platform and rpg elements i been playing the game since its early beta phase im glad to see it got out of the beta hell this is a fantastic game for the 15 price,1,1

211820,Starbound,the galaxy need saving and youre all weve got,1,1
211820,Starbound,i just finished the game must say the disappointment still sinking in pretty heavily they went in so many directions during the development process and a lot of them had so much personality an flair sad to see that in the end chucklefish ended up pretty much handpicking the most bland uninteresting pieces they had over all the years of development and called it the final product ive played the very first version of starbound and came back to check on how it was doing from time to time ironically enough the finished product looks like almost a full rollback to their very first early access version ultimately this is just a shadow of an absolutely amazing game that could have been,-1,1
211820,Starbound,100 recommend this game youll see as of the official 10 release the majority of reviews are negative i respectfully disagree with them did the devs make some shortsighted decisions while pushing the official release they sure did are there things that used to be in the game that have been removed well yeah you bet are there new mechanics that seem tedious and hold back the player simple for the sake of holding back the player pretty much but guess what this game is still not finished the 10 release isnt the end of starbound these devs have been with us since day one the game has always been fun and has always been changing sometimes things get nerfed into oblivion sometimes things are gamebreakingly strong its a delicate task to balance something with so much content and they arent done i have faith that this game will only continue to improve at worst this is a rough patch and in no way do the devs deserve the amount of flak they have received these past few days if youre a little worried about purchasing this game right now then hold off until its on sale or until the majority of recent reviews are positive its your call but dont let all the naysayers scare you away this game is phenomenal and provides many many hours of fun im sure ill get a lot of hate for this review but this is just the way i see it i love starbound through thick and thin and i am deeply saddened that so many people turn their backs on it after being loyal for so long the devs work hard and deserve praise everyone makes mistakes now lets be positive and provide feedback and see some changes for the better thank you for your time,1,1
211820,Starbound,its hard to say which one is better as terraria and starbound both play out very different from one another guess it comes down to your personal preference and what you expect from them personally i favor starbound over terraria to me terraria is all about fighting hoards of monsters and bosses while farming rare drops almost mmorpg style theres little to no story at all and the world itself is very boring and for a game that mostly takes place underground mining and exploration is very tedious and unrewarding this is where the major differences lie with starbound it offers a huge galaxy populated with different races and animals with a good amount of lore behind them theres everything from underwater metropolises to small farming villages ruins of forgotten civilizations creepy dungeons and hightec research labs all this combined with a short story and some beautifully hand crafted missions make starbound a really interesting world to explore starbound also allows for very different playstyles and almost everything is optional in order to progress you can build villages or huge farms explore for resources or mine them become self sufficient or survive by trade do quests and gather a crew or roll as a lone wolf or maybe you just wanna kill pillage and plunder everything in your path all valid options in order to survive that said combat is not as streamlined as in terraria and is more a part of a whole rather than the main focus building farming crops questing and exploring is as much a part of starbound as combat is so if your looking for a similar hacknslash combat focused experience then youll be disappointed and proberly find the game lacking now dont get me wrong combat in starbound aint bad its just different and wide variety of awesome and crazy weapons helps to make it interesting theres swords spears hammers pistols shotguns sniper rifles nade launches flamethrowes rocket launchers weird alien tec etc etc you can even dual wield a large variety of weapons in any way you see fit only thing i personally dont like is a specific class of some voodoo scifi psiops elementalist magic bull that doesnt really seem to fit into the game but i digress starbound is a game suited for people that like to build explore and create their own little adventures if you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer then youll get a plesant and enjoyable experience closing argument and metaphor if terraria is like a lego technic set where you have to follow a specific schematic in order to achieve your goal then starbound is a huge box of random lego blocks that requires you to use your imagination to reach it instead,1,1
211820,Starbound,this game is absolutely amazing you know the gravity dmg can kill you instantly its great to have this game on ur account graphic 910 music so cool you can actually rp at this game planet yes better than no man sky creative furnitures weapons and arms quest u will be confuse about this thing your ship is your place that you can do anything you want workshop furry 4 life crash the game while launch the game memory usage make your pc want to explode outpost laggy af workshop still need to fix because some mods of them make the game crash and crash and crash,1,1
211820,Starbound,edit added more fresh memes and minor text edits you read the reviews of negativity of all the old days of starbound and old people ranting about how it used to be better back then but if youre really new to starbound why should you care you werent there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow when the koalas were furious and when everything was all cream and gravy im not going to lie im an old person too i miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you i miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades i miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items i miss my bubble tech and my old characters i miss when the toolbar only had one l and one r but thats for the old people to mope about sure i miss it but that time has passed long ago new things await ahead and i cant complain about that itll never be old starbound but itll always be starbound to me i think if you started here youd find something you would enjoy you wouldnt be dragged down by the good ol days you would be happy and free like a child experiencing the world for the first time just sit down relax and try starbound for yourself why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself go out there and explore starbound you might find something you could never imagine theres also a race of harambes you can explore galaxies without pants you can slaughter innocent people of towns you find you can kill your friends you can play pokemon and enslave small creatures you can be a weeaboo fish man you can get anime blades you can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to ice people bahahahahaha you can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you dont need you can even be a pro genji like you always dreamed of with mods too holy just get this game right now,1,1
211820,Starbound,ironicly enough the developers play in trashcans edit since my time playing it from 3 or so years ago it hasnt changed much a half baked story samey and bland planets and boring quests its all the same the developers are incompetent and couldnt program a toaster without throwing out all the code 3 times notice how the changelog looks very impressive but if you take a second and look at it no real gameplay has been added terraria is a much more compelling and rich experience and that game didnt need a million dollars a possible alternative to starbound is to slam your head against a wall while playing terraria the best part about that is when if your concussion heals you will have an actually good game to play an entire universe to explore and yet every single planet feels the same water water everywhere and yet not a drop to drink,-1,1
211820,Starbound,developers fail to complete the basic tasks of beta process let alone putting out a good game save your money or spend it on terrarria now that starbound is 10 i gladly say what garbage this game is save your money for otherworld and the 250 hours was helping beta sad my long suffering did not pay off,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i bought this game when it was originally released on steam i gave it some time and understood that being early access it would feel incomplete im no programmer never done anything of this sort but after 11 months i was expecting a lot more content and polish i might recommend this game eventually but based on the progress theyve been making that may not be until next decade,-1,1
211820,Starbound,this game is essentially a really cool lego set with a rather poor story and some cool dungeons which you need to grind boring crap for hours to actually do many of the items that actually made it into the game are useless hoverbikes are practical but awful boats why would you ever want one there dont appear to be any oceans to traverse other than the ones on ocean planets and on those everything worthwhile is underwater by the time you can afford either youll probably be sick of the game farming is too tedious and nothing can be automated theres a cool wiring system but not a lot useful you can actually do with it colonies are simply player made sources of the same crappy fetch and escort quests that nonplayer villages can do colonists wont farm for you your crew are more of a pain than a help and will constantly block crafting stations this looks like an excellent game engine upon which a great game could be made using mods but by itself it really isnt a great game its certainly not what we were sold in the kickstarter nor does it live up to the promise of what was in beta,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i have to say im amazed with starbound i bought it some years ago just out of duty because i started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game which are two major points that would drive me towards a game but im a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like the art was great but the game heavily lacked direction feeling a lot like a scifi terraria hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet built a nice house and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons i was not impressed recently i decided to give it a try if anything because i owned the game and hadnt taken a look at it since two years ago and honestly the game is great now not only theres a story but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character tech to unlock and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward the art is gorgeous and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokmon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun the survival elements are back and although i can see why they took them out of the game feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving theres food everywhere and youll have no problem staying fed the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole youll see the objectives are distinct and the exploration is tense since youll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items a lot of the equipment youll find is more aesthetic than anything and weapons are kinda meh but its super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars making the overall hotkey capacity alright the techs are fun and meaningful getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time the only problems i really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me like for instance when jumping down a platform youll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the down button making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself or that double tapping in a direction can trigger dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise sometimes youll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios but taking it slowly will help with that so its not too bad overall though i think its a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its sea phase the sense of progression is tangible the settlements are fun the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes from an aimless terraria in space to a proper metroidvania starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library 910,1,1
211820,Starbound,played for 5 minutes already more content than no man sky,1,1
211820,Starbound,the release of 10 has been met with both negative and positive responses largely negative as earlyaccess players feel that the game lacks some of the content that previous builds promised and honestly im inclined to agree with this sentiment prior to 10 chucklefish presented us with mechanics like racially exclusive weaponry temperature variants and even space stations there was a lot of great content that has since been removed however the game still has the potential to change something that a lot of people fail to recognise pros visually speaking this is one of the nicest looking pixel platformers ive ever seen the crafting system is rich and complex but does take getting used to you now have the ability to upgrade your crafting stations instead of building newer models the scan function on your mm now means you can craft any item youve scanned prior which is handy each species gets its own unique ship armour sets dialogue and lore with the exception of the novakid seriously where are my novakid towns chucklefish there is a lot to explore both above and below ground no two planets are alike if you have the incentive building houses and buildings is a fun and rewarding experience you can even summon settlers to occupy your builds for you cons the new hud and item bar are difficult to use and look ugly the old one worked fine and wasnt in need of a makeover combat swings between being enjoyable and insufferable the damage on contact system is stupid especially when coupled with the number of monsters that spawn ive had ten of the things on screen and died because of lag because i was crushed in the middle five years and theres still no store all option for item containers the story is weak flimsy and repetitive as a sandbox survival game starbound is brilliant there is a lot to see millions of planets to explore and a great deal of depth to building and creating as well as the reintroduced hunger mechanic as an action game however starbound falls short combat is weak and laggy the game has trouble running when theres a lot on screen and the story falls flat personally i love this game i love it because building and creating and exploring is something i enjoy im quite happy to spend an hour or two gathering materials to customise my ship or house with however this isnt for everyone if youre looking for a more balanced experience regarding combat and plot then there are other games which are much better suited,1,1
211820,Starbound,so i see a lot of bad reviews since the new 10 patch i get people are upset that things got wiped and things have changed people must also remember that these games go through massive changes to make the game more polished and run work better with that being said here is my review as a new player so far i love everything this game has offered since the splash screen my friend and i have completely lost all sense of time and direction while playing thisboth of us came from terraria amazing soundtrack gameplay art styleyes i know its old school but its still pretty crafting systemhuge and tons of variation weapons clothingarmor i could go on about all the great things we have seen in just the few hours we have played i highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of terraria i fought a penguin flying an ufo soooo yea play it and i promise you wont be let down if you are new to the title a lot of the older players from early accessor we its called dont like some of the changes but coming in new you wont know those changes and it wont matter purely because the game is fresh to you do yourself a favor and try it,1,0
211820,Starbound,as someone with a substantial amount of playtime and experience in this its morbidly entertaining to watch this gethave gotten progressively worse with each update edit starbound 10 is out come back and do all the fetch quests all over again this time theres removed content and still a large disparity in balance there have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3d printer now but theyre immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to nearly max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3d printed furniture all variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now the arid deserted ded landscape that was starbounds endgame is now slightly more decorated but to compensate all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be hooray oh and dont consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what i mean,-1,1
211820,Starbound,when i tought this game couldnt get better they got mods for it now i have over 300 hours just buy it already,1,1
211820,Starbound,game came out we all hyped played with 6 people was pretty fun we had a small colony made it grow at the end when we got to end game and killed cthuluface we were kinda kicked in the nuts when it just stopped there somehow the game has less content than when it was in beta it starts great but that ending shorter than rage,-1,1
211820,Starbound,game is finally out but it seems to be rushed and incomplete version 10 is extremely poorly optimized game drops to 15 fps and fluctuates wildly depending on your environment an rx480 is just as good as a laptop gpu crafting wise it seems to have a lot of ornamental things but actual useful items not that many in some 1215 hours you can upgrade everything you need leaving you only to follow the main quest npc sidequests are rather stupid take noteresources to some other npc nearby if youre lucky or go to some area in the world and get some npc back to town not sure why they thought mmo type quests will be fun given how long it took for the developers to actually release the game justifying it as we dont want to rush it we want the game to be great we dont want to offer a half baked experience i cant help but think that chuckle when the game starts is a sort of you idiots paid us 3 years ago for this game bet you feel smart now very disappointed by what the game delivered vs what it promised to be honest i might have gone past the content if the game wasnt performing so awful,-1,1
211820,Starbound,first i recommend checking out tystarchius review here since my thoughts are basically a continuation and elaboration httpsteamcommunitycomidtystarchiusrecommended211820 like him i wish there was a third neutral option i cant recommend the game in its current state but that doesnt make it necessarily a bad game i want to be able to come back to this review in a year and just replace the whole thing with edit nvm as it stands however there are simply too many flawed design decisions and sillystupid mechanical mistakes to enjoy it there are numerous small missteps so im going to just go for the big ones here the gameplay loop is broken quick definition gameplay loops describe the core set of repetitive actions that make a game fun and are composed of multiple disparate elements for example in doom youre not just shooting monsters youre also searching for secrets which lead to treasure which enhances your ability to shoot more monsters stardew valley has a halfdozen systems that interweave farming fighting socializing that all positively influence and enhance one another any given activity provides benefits to other activities meaning time is never wasted and youre always making progress in starbound this loop is broken as all of the various systems are disconnected you can complete the game without ever creating a single settlement planting a single seed or taking a single randomlygenerated mission to gain a crew member for some reason chucklefish thought this was a selling point instead of a massive design failure being able to skip entire elements systems and game mechanics is not good game design not only that but these extra systems are completely superfluous as they are less efficient than the core element of planet exploration you can just run around collecting the resources which is usually a much faster method than farming or questing the point of a gameplay loop is to give the players a break and let them focus on other activities before returning to the main progression this keeps the game fresh longer and prevents burnoutfatigue which is incredibly important in longrunning games like this terrarias gameplay loop balanced this well exploring fighting looting digging would lead naturally to the other elements like farming critically important buffs from potions and building new npcs at a steady rate need housing without forcing you to dump more time than strictly necessary if you didnt want to get fancy the survival mechanics arent fun first hunger this mechanic has never been fun for me and its implementation in starbound is no different use a consumable item every x minuteshours is just an annoyance fortunately food is generally abundant defeating the whole purpose of the mechanic but more importantly more complex and rare foods give you a ton of bonuses which is pretty fun however the environmental protection pack as a gate to planetary exploration is incredibly lazy its just an armor slot that unlocks a few more biomes at a time which are all coincidentally around specific stars theres nothing interesting about it just oh i can go to a jungle planet now which was apparently radioactive before this is likely to make each new biome feel exciting and fresh but instead it just makes them feel uninteresting this is exacerbated by the fact most minibiome and dungeons including villages can appear in any biome leading to floran villages perched between volcanoes avian villages set in frozen wastelands and beautiful flower gardens springing up on eternally dark horrorplanets speaking of randomization the procedural generation is lackluster this is a doozy i will grant that the planet terrain generation has improved significantly over the years since the first playable alpha but its still not as robust or interesting as terrarias granted terraria has a few years head start on starbound but it still needs a lot more work to be competitive my main gripe is that all of the dungeon spawns are literally identical down to creature spawns aesthetic decorations and even treasure loot tables i once found two underground abandoned glitch dungeons with an epp mod in the exact same random corner box this means that if youve seen one hylotl town or apex resistance base youve literally seen all of them theres no mystery or excitement its just oh these guys again this is pretty much inexcusable given the game prides itself on randomization and the nature of these changes are trivial the game generates entire planets why are all the dungeons wholly static if you need some suggestions spelunky released an interactive tutorial that explains how their rooms are put together why is this a problem for starbound progression and solar systems are goofy as mentioned above the epp is a silly lazy content gate to different solar systems i should be able to see icy planets toward the outer edge of a system while those toward the center are hot and find a mixture of biomes and challenges across them for me to discover if i can or cant handle on my own just a handwavey yeah youre good bro to the next color of star is boring this also means the planets all feel samey with some different art assets but the same gameplay theres no difference between mining on a volcanic planet or a frozen planet other than getting down from the surface initially the progression of armor tiers is just basic stat increases with a very uninspired rangedamagedefense decision in endgame its the same process to collect ores from every planet with no differences in threat or difficulty once youve reached the appropriate gear tier its almost a microcosm of the game itself dig past the shallow surface and underneath its the same over and over again until you win or get bored this is where the survival elements could tie in with the colony system had you any reason to build one except colonists dont care if theyre on a lava planet or tropical paradise their quests dont change they dont ask for structural protections from the elements or anything they just stand around like every other npc villager and do little cute things until theyre either attacked or have a quest for you no build a weather machine or help us set up a farm but the soil sucks because its a toxic planet just billy got lost or theres a bunch of cultists out by that random lawn chair can you go investigate this review has rambled on long enough so im going to end it here i critique because i care i want starbound to succeed and get better and the only way to do that is to complain at length about the numerous problems in hopes someone notices and starts to fix it mods will help in the future but right now there arent any to address the deep and jarring issues with the base systems themselves maybe in a year itll be finally finished but right now tldr pls make game better tia,-1,1
211820,Starbound,ive waited 4 years for this game to come out i was really devastated to find out they succumbed and released it out into the earlyaccess because it was around the time when earlyaccess was getting a lot of love and only so much hate this was before stuff like towns development stopped and stuff people didnt yet see the trouble in it all well it came out there and i played it along with others i walked around i killed things i did the lame penguin boss fights i was unimpressed rightly so i would think its not fully developed yet its not released i couldnt judge it well in its state i noticed things were getting added by community requests and this is where i started to shy away from it i didnt want to see what was gonna be one of my dream games altered and messed around with by the community for good or worse so i ignore the dev blog from there on out and waited my extra i guess two years lo and behold right there on steam its out lets give this a proper go ignore 30 hours of gameplay that was with the betas my actual playtime is no more than 17 hours also steam didnt have enough space for my full review i trimmed where i could the intro to the game is very slow and sluggish it gives you the basic tools you need to get started and you start mining away at the surface for goodies and oddities pretty classic compared to another game of this genre i amassed my metals and my tools made myself new weapons and armors and got to more killing then your first real quest is to go really deep into the planet get a certain type of material and teleport to the hub of the game well god damn if that didnt take me forever it didnt feel that exciting after you find out about the hub you find out you have to mine moons for fuel to jump to new planets out of your reach might sound cool at first but it gets annoying very fast you tend to hop planet to planet mining the next tier of resources and making stuff but within this whole mess you have to go around to certain planets and find each of the six races and their civilizations and go into scan mode and start clicking around for green highlighted objects and talk to people to learn more about them and eventually get the next mission to go on the missions are like adventure instances a premade map with an objective and puzzles with monsters all over the place theyre fun but after you do a few of em you just want it to stop they lose their interest quickly when the bosses later turn into bullet sponges few of them are unique with cool fights the main storyline itself just felt too forced i thought this was sort of a primarily exploration and sandbox based game well multiple aspects and shops etc are blocked from you until you progress enough in the storyline so it feels forced and boring right off the bat normally to me this would have been fine but this felt unnecessary and everything else just gets flat because of it it gets really annoying trying to find the proper planets to just scan some more and more onto the gameplay aspects and mechanics progression in the game is done by crafting you craft the first tier of armor and weapons and then you tend to go find new randomly generated weapons to kick with and crafting new toolbenches and armor to go along with the new materials its a little sad being that making your own weapons is a waste of time because all the strong and unique ones are all out there in the universe not on your crafting screen theres only a few tiers of actual equipment as well its very short lived by 8 hours into the game i had already acquired what seemed to be the best armor out of the materials you find in the game onto the ui of the game its just annoying i dont feel like its presented very well it could have been much cleaner opening your inventory always gave me a headache as it opens right in the damn middle of your screen blocking your character and things around them you can move it around thankfully but it doesnt maintain that position the next time you open it so its just a constant struggle trying to open it up in the field theres a sort function for it thankfully but not for chests which gets very annoying because theres simply so much you pick up in the game that you need to constantly reorganize it all if youre picking it all up with chests not being able to be sorted it just causes you a whole hour of frustration trying to reorganize it all the difficulty of the game is modest when you make your character you have the choice of casual survival or hardcore casual has no real penalties for dying you only drop a small percentage of pixels and you can just walk on back and get right back to it survival seems to be the normal difficulty you need to eat to survive you drop certain items on death and you drop more pixels hardcore is survival included that when you die once youre dead forever in the end i honestly just felt stupid for playing survival my other friends just chose casual because having to keep up with food all the time just sounded like an annoying chore it really was i would constantly just be chowing down whatever i found to keep my meter happy and the drop items on death penalty just made it all the while more boring theres a lot of other little attractions here and there you can own a farm and make shipments homage to harvest moon i would assume theres a pokemonlike capturing system for pets upgrades to your ship along with crew vehicles to ride around in though no promised mech sadly little challenge rooms out in the world theyre neat though ultimately i never gave em a chance i got my hotrod and rode around and that was that sadly theres a lot of bugs in the game more than i was betting on food sometimes became infinite planets generated too slowly for me to traverse and ive had the game crash on me and freeze several times when im just moving about the fps however takes the cake it would constantly keep dropping and screwing up i looked around and tried the fixes people suggested and to no avail and i typically dont have technical issues with games on my end so this was a huge concern of mine dropping to 30 frames when just walking around really sucks graphiclyaesthetically its awesome and the soundtrack is amazing along with it good listening in and out of game all in all at the end of the day the game feels like its just a bit of a repetitve cycle with no clear reward at the end hop from planet to planet hoping to find something cool next time and get annoyed that you have to keep mining fuel to continue on i beat the game and it just didnt feel satisfying in the least ive felt like i havent covered enough about the game but at the same time i can feel and see that ive written too much already i dont feel like this game is a worthy spirtual successor to terraria as some would like to claim i had that notion back when it was in development but no more i just see this as another blotch on my game list that i want removed if you read through and at one point just said but theres a mod for x or wait for an update then no and no the player shouldnt have to resort to mods to fix an issue and ive done plenty of waiting i thought one of the points of the beta was so they could fix things and polish it all up sadly it still feels quite raw and buggy and just not worth my investment i dont want to wait around longer for things to get better that was suppose to be now i dunno if the wait was really worth it is what im getting at tldr this is a one way trip out into space wether you want to stay up there or land somewhere else well you might get displeased either way,-1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound one of the most amazing game i played ever i play this game from 3 yearsupdate after update after update for now its like to see a child growing up strabound have a story mod nowits nice but its bad logic and may get bored starbound in the first was amazing game with bosses battle and that was good and spend alot of time playing this game and trying to beat all of the bosseslike terraria the sound track is amazing and they fix alot of multiplayer proplems you can finish the story mod with your friend and its more fun than the singleplayer if you have a friends to play with but the story mod broke the gamebroke the addict of the game for me i enjoyed playing terraria more than this game terraria have alot of things to do and exploring and bosses imporve your skills and alot but starbound logic based in boring logic in the end the game is fantastic and addict with friends with good price hope this storymod get change in the future,1,0
211820,Starbound,played this game all the way from its inception and i have to say i am dissapointed with the final product in relation to the time they spent on it the problems are not with what the game is it is a good game it is what it could have been and to me the final execution feels rushed so many reworks i think they tried to achieve perfection and got tired with it and in the end released a ill thought out rushed game ok here are my main problems the questline and story they added is terrible the main questline features a few basic starter tutorial like missions to get you into the game and then basically has you repeat the exact same quest 6 times before facing a final boss it is always worrying when the tutorial missions are more interesting and fun to play then any other part of the game it is also so crazy short i completed the game in 2 days with little effort which links in to my second issue it is very easy this is basically down to progression not being linked to the questline once your out of the starter missions and you have repaired your ship you can basically get a a top tier weapon and armor before actually doing any of the main questline progression in starbound is not bound to the questline or story i think this was a design flaw sure you can just pace it yourself but the even bigger issue is this my next point you can basically mine everything you need to progress to the next tech tier in one mining run so for example when i unlocked tech to let me visit the fiery or frozen stars basically the stars that had everything but the final ore i was able to mine enough of every single resource needed to completely max my tech out in one trip i was able to get enough materials to get all three of the end game armor sets and crafting stations from one run then when you unlock the final planet ore again one run gives you all the solarium you need to finally max out your armor and anything else you need thats it game is pretty much done you should have a god like weapon by now as they can literally spawn in the most basic of chests anywhere in the game so if you havent already beaten all the bosses go and jump about spamming fire and complete them thats pretty much it which leads me to my next issue i dont see any reason to play on once completed you may differ with me in opinion here but i really couldnt see any point in going back to play any more i mean the fun is in looting and exploring right so once you have unlocked the hardest difficulty planet there is no point in going to any others as the reward is worthless to you at this point the side missions and townvillages they implemented with npc missions are utterly pointless very low reward for doing repitive tedious missions so basically 90 of the games worlds are no longer worth visiting at this point you already have godlike everything which you found in the first chest you encountered on one of these planets what is the point i really hope i am missing something here but this was my experience of it sure you can max your ship out sure you can try to build a colony it all just feels shallow and completely pointless like features people wanted which they just added without any thought in relating it to the rest of the gameplay i played terraria for weeks and actually found bits of it tough i dont think i ever saw everything and the final boss was difficult for me and took me quite a few attempts i honestly finished starbounds final release in two days and never really had any problems dying what could they have done make looting make sense so rubbish loot on the surface better loot for quest rewards more rare items the deeper you go etc make an end game where early game planets are still relevant make other game features like ship and colony building relevant and necessary for the main game questline actually have a decent questline with variation in missions and a lot lot lot more of them increase overall difficulty of pretty much everything the final 4 tiers of ore are basically split on 2 tiers 3 of them having equal weighting on a lower tier and then one final ore which lets you upgrade each of these 3 tiers to a final tier we are talking armor and weaponry here this was a clear of sign of rushing to me these should have been four seperate upgrades instead of two and so much more i could write all night but i am not going to i have to ask myself what did they spend well over a year on i played ti with my friend before and we actually spent a good week on it and i remember having a lot of fun there were not any quests and maybe one or two bosses i cannot remember but the progression made more sense and the game was tougher i remember actually struggling against mobs at points we actually had to do the old build a wall around us with a peep hole to shoot out of trick to actually get through some of the tougher areas loot made sense as well like it was actually worth exploring and looting stuff what happened guys i thought this was gonna be the game that kept me amused for months when it was completed i could have beat ruin with my eyes closed tldr in summary this is a fun game and an enjoyable experience its just too easy too short with a lot of worthless features adding nothing to gameplay and most damaging for it it has no replay value at all once you have beaten all the bosses as the game design makes 90 of the game worthless after this point,-1,1
211820,Starbound,since this game attracts the terraria crowd heres a review about what you should expect out of this game compared to terraria for starters starbound is kind of like terraria on steroids its bigger far more involved it actually has a quest component to it and its way harder starbound vs terraria gameplay differences even on the easiest setting starbound plays like terraria hardmode from the very beginning theres a difference between hard and obnoxious though and in my opinion this game is in the hard category youll have to get on your feet and learn how things work but thankfully this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time you really appreciate every item you find because youre going to be very weak for a long time in the beginning and your first desire will be to get rid of that crappy starter weapon if youve already played terraria youll know how to jump right in to starbound the game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining taking items building houses and fighting enemies its bascially another take on terraria as youll see very quickly terrarias controls are simply better jumping and curving in midair to reach a narrow platform is frustrating in this game and youll have to get used to how its gravity works as it is far more unforgiving couple that with the fact that youll get seriously hurt or killed from falling starbound has a bigger emphasis on food than terraria food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in terraria except for pumpkin pies but it is a necessity here especially on the harder tier where youll starve to deaththis doesnt happen in the easiest mode though youll start off finding and knowing about basic food but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items food not only increases health but gives perks and stat boosts as well even on the easiest setting food rots if you hold on to it for too long starbound vs terraria combat combat is highly simplistic in starbound it is nothing more than hack amp slash for the most part some monsters attack by nature some dont but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked making combat predictable in this game unlike terraria youll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly and not far after getting started rather than in terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain npcs for the most part one handed swords swing quicky and allow you to use a shield in the other hand but they are weak and will require many hits to kill an enemy twohanded swords are slow but do far more damange than a onehanded other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse and release to swing guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down but will allow you to do it from a safe distance in the beginning youll want to stay far far away from any enemy that has a gun especially if its a sniper rifle starbound vs terraria look amp feel starbound has the look and feel of an early 90s pc or snes game kind of like something made by ocean or sierra as opposed to terrarias more pixellated nes feel starbounds music is more predictable and uniform lots of quiet soothing piano music starbounds monsters look like pokemon rejects which kind of gave the game its own characteristic i personally like the huge range style and diversity of terrarias creatures way more landscapes are far more detailed then terraria especially backdrops trees and other elements trees fall sideways when cut and youll be surprised when you see your first landslide when youre mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime this game has the same biome style regions as terraria where youll venture from a forest to a jungle or from a cavern to a slime pit and eventually down to magma from experience it looks like digging too far down will result in an long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava be careful when youre digging a starbound hellevator as you wont get the same results as you did in terraria terrarias building mechanic is more involved and intricate than starbound for the simple reason of hammers they allowed you to hit blocks into angles and make tons of different and unique designs corners and slopes in terraria no such thing exists in starbound where you can only place items in square blocks however starbounds graphics are more detailed and beautiful and youll still be able to create great looking structures theres no corruption or crimson style event that youll have to worry about in starbound so create what you want and dont worry about what will happen to it midway through the game for the most part you take take or steal almost everything you see in starbound just like you can in terraria except on missions for example your first real mission the outpost where all of the chairsbedsconsolesetc are locked down and immobile for items that you cant craft you may come across blueprints which are oneuse items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables one you have the necessary tool to do so when it comes to crafting everything works pretty much the same between the two games craft a workbenchstyle item and it will allow you to create new items in starbound you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items youll find that in order to do this better ore from outside your solar system is necessary negatives you cant pause the game why starbound vs terraria my favorite things there are a few things that set starbound from terraria in my mind the games universe seems bigger and more involved because it simply isyoure no longer standed on a single game world of smallmediumlarge thats created from the main menu but an entire universe is created for you when you first start a starbound quest youll get your own space ship which can be decorated like a house and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel to see how big the game world is zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them its an exciting thing to figure out on your first playthrough the game has objectives and a questline for you to go through which makes the game interesting rather than terrarias grind and get more powerful which becomes stale through time while there are plenty of boilerplate fetch quests in starbound theyll force you to check out locations you havent seen yet i actually like the increase in difficulty that starbound has vs terraria its easy to adjust to and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game since they are far more difficult to find than in terraria and random chests dont usually mean uber weapons are in thembut mediocre ones or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing but worse at another damage vs speed you wont be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile at least until you get the courage to leave the solar system so youll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts overall if you loved terraria but got tired of it you wont want to miss this one its a bigger take on terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting,1,0
211820,Starbound,hi guys happydays here looking at starbound 10 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrec8pgtuwx0 having played starbound prior to the full release i was excited to see what the developers had changed moving in to a full version 10 release initial impressions seem positive movement and combat seem more dynamic the intro is enjoyable with a few hidden items along the way the developers have introduced an enemy the player must hunt throughout their adventure which is a nice addition one big thing i immediately noticed is that the initial healing item is now salve instead of bandages i love this as it gives a slower heal rate and makes combat more tactical rather than tank hits and spam bandages for massive healing salve heals 50hp over 10 seconds which means you cannot simply tank groups of enemies early on i will update this review as i explore more of the content but initial impressions seem great,1,1
211820,Starbound,all of my friends and my wife absolutely loved terreria i didnt by the time i decided to give it a go everyone was so far ahead that i never got to experience that exploration dicovering things for myself aspect of the game now i am totally getting that from this game i get to not only explore my own starting world where i have built a pretty cool colony but i also get to travel to other worlds and meet other civilizations and colonies i am having a blast now a terreria vetran may still tell you that this game isnt as good or whatever but it certainly is special to me i am really enjoying sinking time into it,1,1
211820,Starbound,oh starbound will you ever reach the the greatness or even the fun standards from terraria no you wont which is sad because i hoped this game will be at least fun to play it was in the beginning then i realized it was just pure grind everything in this game is just that grind also the fullscreen isnt working anymore which is maybe just a temporary fail but it sucks really its just really sad that in 2014 when i purchased the game i thought it was very fun and a game that could reach the fun factor of terraria then over the years i realized nearly nothing would change with the game dont get me wrong stuff was added over time like races items weapons monsters npcs and so on but adding mod support in early access could already be a bad sign because well developers can use this advantage to let the people who purchased the game finish it instead of finishing it themselves but no major or small update brought it even near of something like the 13 update for terraria but the game has a terrible developer behind it that with the massive amount of money they got from starbound are they using to well publish other games maybe even start to develop other games the developers moving locations and try to live in a more expensive town what i heard bought real pets and so on instead of focusing everything on starbound and then worry about the next thing i am very dissapointed chucklefish update 13th april 2016 now i originally didnt wanted to be so harsh on this game back in 2014 it actually was fun and this game still has potential now when the game is finally going to be released ill may take a second look and maybe even say well now its actually a fun little game well even if i still cant compare it to terraria other than that it does many things well enough that its currently doing except for some broken things that i hope are fixed by now well i should say what a perfect game would look like to me cheap or the price must justify the content many stuff to do say you must have many possibilities in the persistend game a lot of content also features nice developers i actually dont know much about chucklefish those accusations above could be wrong nice community thats obvious mod support for a more community life support deep when you still think you havent seen and tried everything singleplayer and multiplayer for both types of people who enjoy playing alone or with friends original dont just be ruthless copy or ripoff of something else that is currently popular creative i always liked seeing things that i never seen before focused the game should know what it wants it to be and who its target audience should be replay value it should be enough fun so that you want to play it again and again even get after the 100th time you dont get bored deep lore so i want to learn more about its content great controls so that it feels great and responsible not clunky as hell no useless dlcs and microtransactions when the dlc is actually adding content not just sell something seperatley that should have been in the game offline playability when you have no or bad internet maybe someday everything of this will count for starbound answell as it did for cough terraria well i do compare it alot to terraria do i even though i guess it got its inspiration from it a bitxd alright there is one last positive thing i can say for starbound since the first time i played it the soundtrack is amazing maybe after its 10 release ill think differently about it who knows but now i still wouldnt recommend it update 6th may 2016 also something i noticed just recently is through the new reviews yes of course everytime when this game got updated you lose all your characters so i still dont recommend it update 26th july 2016 a question how do you make a game better by removing features and content what update 27th july 2016 compare terraria to starbound terraria announced a new update adds thousands of new stuff starbound announced a new update removes thousands of things but really what the hell is going on with starbound yeah i know what just remove all the stuff that didnt quite work in the betas and alphas and call it a finished game also let the mod community finish the game even now ive seen hundreds of workshop mods improved interface better customization more armors more weapons mechs many new monsters better ship customization better farming more inventory space more items new planets and biomes more outfits etc etc all of that that should have been in the game what you see now as mods or rather let the community finish what we have started and announced to do from the beginning content starbound had such a larger budget from the beginning compared to terraria what the flying bulldonkey happened whit it whispers by the way it was nearly 5 years in development from the idea to the finished product,-1,1
211820,Starbound,its like a worse version of terraria only it costs more,-1,1
211820,Starbound,the game frankly was a hell of a lot better when i thought it was bare bones but now i see it had more to offer before it felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you now well theres this insanely halfbaked and arbitrary story you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses i have ever seen in a video game some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables making it boring unneeded crafting times of 05 to 10 seconds have been added since early access which begs the question why even have them no longer feels like an exploration sandbox race spesific ship ai was removed why it also got a lot more annoying guns still suck colossal dong game feels like it has less than when i considered it bare bones start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason if they decide they want to actually improve their game ill change my reveiw as i have done with other things in the past but for now this game is just flaming garbage compaired to what it was in early access,-1,0
211820,Starbound,disclaimer this review is based on my own opinions and may or may not differ from other opinions,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i loved this game and i cant recommend it now now before this gets written off as just another off reviewer because they broke my game i just wanna point out some things that were better before and for some reason are gone planets oh my god why did they make planets boring now there used to be a randomizer for planets so you had a reason to explore and try to find the planet type you wanted with the weather you wanted in order to settle down for fun now you just run through the same few planet archetypes and be done with it theres no fun in discovering a new planet now each one is the same as the last with minor variations monsters monster variety is gone they did away with the randomizer and instead added biome specific mobs and kept in a couple of random monster parts but not many crafting not a lot changed with crafting except that they reduced what you could craft every crafting tier has only 2 weapons now to make matters worse everyone crafts the same weapons with endgame materials the story its not so much epic as just a thing you do its not even needed to progress through planets of different difficulty you could play the game and do anything you want without ever needing to touch the quests past the beginning ones which are necessary to fix your ship theres just no point to it random quests not random have fun running back and forth random locations looking for an npc that the questgiver lost or you have to go deliver a thing theres no actual randomness its just those 2 at least as far as i saw and ive gone through like 100 planets and apparently there was a thing with pets but i have no experience so i cant comment on whether good or bad tl dr the game has a bunch of things that were gutted and are no longer fun because of this i cant recommend it as is there are fun elements but youll soon be bored of planet exploration which was the point of the game to begin with i recommend people on the fence just wait for more updates to add more stuff and maybe even revamp some looking at you planets so disappointed otherwise its just a normal sandbox dig craft build fight there used to be a great game and i believe theres one still,-1,0
211820,Starbound,the game in its self i would recommend howevertiyl the big cheese of chuckle fish has no idea how to handle customers you dont abuse the people who support you and buy things from you hay yeah can i get a cheeseburger yeah sure here it is by the way your mentally challanged ok cool you from now on im going to macas he and a few others from cf have got some seriously bad press and quite frankly i think alot of people will not be buying from chuckle fish in the future because of the way they and others in the community have been treated if he handled complaints better i wouldnt give 2 when the game comes out but they abuse people cop when they whine is ridiculous there the people buying from you if they want to be rude so be it suck it up be polite to them and there attitude will change and they will join your side and stop ing treat them like and call them brain dead and of course they will continue to carry on like a frigin 3 year old anyways if you want to support people who seriously call there fan base brain dead and blame the lack of development on them then go ahead the game is fun i just cant stand the people behind it update games worth it get it if you like terraria or other games simiar in design,-1,0
211820,Starbound,i wish i could be kinder to this game but starbound aka feature creep the official game of the movie just isnt that great setting aside the farcically protracted development time the long chain of broken promises from the developers and the frustrating apologist community that refuses to entertain any criticism the game never rises above being pretty neat but impossible to recommend planethopping in concept is really cool and as block buildingstyle games go you have a lot of latitude to create some nice stuff but much of the rest of the content is fairly vapid and often only serves as an obstacle or chore that restricts you from exploration unless you participate in it to the games satisfaction once you burn through all of the possible biomes and settlements the game can generate and maybe build a thing or two theres very little motivation to continue playing the changes from beta feel very much like one step forward and two steps back in terms of tooling the game for fun and player convenience for example instead of making mining more enjoyable ore has just been made more easily available through other avenues for players who want to bypass it essentially mooting one of the primary gameplay modes no such luck though if you hate the games combat because space farmin aint gonna kill the story bosses for you in that sense starbound is more like a mediocre platformer with a huge amount of padding between levels and an excessive amount of optional sandbox side content most of my 200 hours of playtime are unearned in the sense that the majority of them were spent planetcrawling or grinding for resources in other words sifting through randomly generated content just trying to find the one thing i needed so maybe its more like a sandbox that arms you with a plastic sieve and tells you someone dropped a quarter in it a week ago the story itself might charitably be described as serviceable but the story missions are garbage you cant build or dig anywhere to stop you from cheating but starbounds combat and platforming are too shallow and unrefined to stand on their own not to mention the fact that the mission maps are so poorly optimized that i consistently crash out unless i run the game in a tiny window despite exceeding the minimum requirements in fact i have to regularly save amp quit every hour or so because there seems to be a memory leak issue where my graphics get corrupted did i mention you can sometimes irretrievably lose all of your teleporter bookmarks for no reason a bug that has persisted for over a year seems like something youd probably want to prioritize for release a game like this lives and dies on novelty which is fine but the path to that novelty is gated by tedious uninventive resource grinding and weak action platforming that runs contrary to the developers insistent sandbox rhetoric copy on the official website claims that starbound allows you to create your own story unless youre playing a novakid who are completely excluded from the main storyline and still have no settlements oops and that there is no wrong way to play both of which are patently untrue with the way the player is constantly shackled to tutorials and story quests that only have one right answer and staunchly refuse to let you think outside the box there is no story or win state outside of playing the game exactly the way the developers intended and for a game like this that promised so much and delivered on so little of it that is quite unfortunate not only is the decision to make platforming and combat the core gameplay experience misguided it seems totally arbitrary considering planet generation is clearly what had the most work put into it at this point the game cannot be fixed with more content balance tweaks or fan mods what it needed was a more focused and unified development cycle and a team that actually listened to player feedback instead of insisting that being able to play a flute in space was more important than releasing on time and that ship has sailed,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i purchased this game for my brother and i an almost 30 investent i had played the game in the unstable betas a while back and it had loads of potential when i bought it i fantasized about what amazing boss battles would be added what new quests would be added to the outpost how would they revamp the weapons crafting planets ships how amazing a central story arc would be the game trailer had my hype levels through the interstellar roof my main thought was could it even be better than before the answer my friends appears to be no in fact the overall quality of the game has fallen drastically from what was there previously the weapons have become less amazing random and awesome than before it has a lack of rare weapons the cool ones being nearly impossible to obtain daggers and hammers are practically useless and class armor is generic at best i along with some other gaing friends were expecting some awesome endgame set boosts like gliding for avians or endless energy during the day for florans however these never came true and armor found in chests is next to useless before even leaving your starter world not only that but all lowteir copper iron gold weapons were completely removed from the game character tech has also recieved a downgrade with a very small amount of upgrades and only one in each of the now 3 categories that is worthwhile spike ball sprint and triple jump the bubble tech no longer exists the planet system no longer has difficulty sectors but different teired stars leading only to a mad dash to the glosest fiery planet for endgame loot the temperature system has been replaced by the epp a barelyaugmentable pack that is far too easy and relatively boring to make many of the rng creatures have also become thngs of the past the mechs and amzing and fun planetary exploration machine has been replaced by speeders so expensive that they become obsolete by the time you save enough pixels for them the crew system although beneficial is a real hassle when it comes to upgrading your ship also the erchius ghost is a pain enough said the story had amazing potential i loved every second of the tutorial grabbing both the flower and the cape and i couldnt wait to see what the outpost had after finally reaching it i was met with three quests three one for the techs one for the ore mart and one for dreadwing remember all of those fun personal quests gone remember spending a hour on mazebound to cash in both a quest and an enormous sense of achievemnt pointless then we get to the ark the scan quests tedious and annoying that eigth race everyone was speculating about never happened i remembered being so hyped for the new story quests after beating the hunting caverns but it turned out that every single on of these was a glorified trapped puzzle labyrinth each with its own theme and each boss chamber was just a rectangular room no variation no truly unique battles just hit until you die or it dies staying in the same room in fact the planetary exploration system makes it so you can have endgame gear before you even do the floran mission leading to really a broken system even after beating it the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth what starbound desperately needs more inventive boss missions a better exploration and teir system more weapons and unique armors better techs and mechs a larger variation of creatures the outpost quests to return a novel idea would be to have space pirates a very realistic thing in a univese like starbounds that scales up in occurance and difficulty as you travel to better planets when attacked you could either pay a fine or choose to board their randomly generated ship of hostile enemies of any race even the nonplayable ones once you beat the underlings and possibly a miniboss captain you could have a loot chest that also scales with the solar teir much like challenge dimensions there would also be a hidden loot chest somehere in the ship once defeated you would just go on your merry way as much as i love starbound until it gets some serious updates i wont be playing it again,-1,1
211820,Starbound,the early access was brilliant better than this stable version currently the game 10 release has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades it used to be a fun type of grind but with the general need for more items volume as well as different type to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating although the pace for upgrading your mm and tech feels a bit better the change to equipping items feels terrible initially i thought id get used to it like a person normally would but it feels too unnatural you need to equip many items in general melee weapon ranged weapon torches rope trash blocks flashlight health kits thats mainly for exploring even then more items can be added and for some reason many items that you think would be singlehanded are actually twohanded great even more switching to do the need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony go out into that vast universe and become a farmer it does get better but takes away from the experience nonetheless the array of items and scenery is great planets are much more interesting playing with friends has never been easier also its got a lot of potential it always had theyre holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores edit ive deleted the comments that commented on my hours i have at least 60 hours in total and thats a very conservative estimate,-1,1
211820,Starbound,its nice that you added a decent story but all the quests now just feel like filler including the sidequests i want to love this game but i really cant anymore i remember when campfires were used as heat and there was actually a point in moving to other planets other than just making a bline to the nearest fiery star or frozen star just to click on some objects to complete the quest and then defeat a dungeon and then move onto the next star this game used to be great there was actually a reason to go to some random planet in the middle of no where but now theres literally no point other than to make a colony which i dont even see how its useful in anyway if you like a very short main story this is a great game for you if you like a game with a good long story that actual feels like an achievement doing stuff dont get this game or maybe you should have back a few updates ago i have to say its a fun game and its a change from minecraft or terraria or any other sandbox games but until the devs fix the problems many others have stated its not worth buying in the current state that this game is in i do not recommend it but if chucklefish were to ever fix these problems definitely get this game please chucklefish fix this game it has so much potential to be an amazing game but youve just wasted it 5510,-1,1
211820,Starbound,the 10 release stripped almost all of the content that made the game fun planets and monsters are no longer random difficulty and progression are locked to your current tier no more planet hopping to find cool items wait for another release when they can put the last 3 years worth of work back into the game,-1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound at first looked like a regular 2d survival game like terraria it didnt show me much information for me to be interrested but hey it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends and oh boy i was sure right this game combines everything that terraria missed and combined with minecrafts hugeness and multiplayer it may be a bit harsh at first but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier small details that bring people together just like instruments you can play certain instruments in this game and it even has a function to play as a band it may seem small but its a huge thing to bring friends closer the usual laugh midgame of someones desgrace and the excitement when someone gets an op weapon the mining adventures and get you lost deep inside a planet the adventures on the surface battling through monsters and discovering villages of a friendly race not to mention the breaks to play a music as a band this is a true game to play with friends i recommend 100 this game yes it does has its flaws like wipes and characters deletion but its in beta what did you expected a bugfree beta game starbound is a great game and its worth all the money i gave for it best of luck to the developers,1,0
211820,Starbound,starbound is super chill amazingly complex and fun to play play it no really just play it come on,1,1
211820,Starbound,a game too ambitious for its own good thats the tragic story of starbound in a nutshell ive played it numerous times since the early access hoping that each iteration would bring forth new content but in the end none of those times felt like it was something worth revisiting even the fabled 10 update where the game is now fullyfledged and no longer in early game access after three years doesnt feel anything like it should starbound has a lot of great things going for it the artstyle and presentation of the graphics while slightly shoddy at times is well animated and distinct none of it feels muddied and it has a lot of charm with some of the nonrandom enemies the music while repetitive at times is relaxing and comfy to listen to building your own ship gathering up crew making little colonies on planets stocked with people youve hired for the task starbound is keen on letting you explore the universe at your own pace but therein lies the biggest problem starbound is not just a sandbox game but a sandbox game that is generated across an entire universe there is only so much you can do before you start running into the same biomes the same structures the same villages the same enemies and their attack patterns this same problem feels eerily reminiscient of another game no mans sky i will say this starbound compared to when i last binged on it two to three years ago has changed both for better and worse there is a more streamlined story more items to grab more villages and towns you can visit but with it the unique quests you get from the outpost has been virtually made obsolete barring a handful of them the crew you take on might as well be robots they dont say much of anything and rather their only flavor text is their name and mood even the main side characters get maybe a whole page of dialogue altogether outside of their recruitment missions they dont say anything memorable in fact starbound as a whole doesnt feel memorable why is it that its precursor and competition terraria is that much better because terraria doesnt rely on random generation beyond its overworld the enemies items and whatnot are all mostly going to stay the same in every world generated some might appear some might vanish but it is a far more static game than starbound in fact terraria doesnt even have that much of a plot and yet its by far the superior game due to the amount of unique items enemies armors strategies and so on and so forth on the other hand starbound enemies items armors and even the main playing strategy are pretty much the same there are some neat abilities but due to their random nature your beastmode billywhacker will eventually be replaced by a junky moleseeker in fact a lot of it got downgraded from the last time i played i remember when even the most random of enemies had some sort of special move that would force you to adapt thats all been given to the unique monsters which are just as dumb starbounds progression is extremely weak and the only thing that changes is that the numbers get higher as you go up the ranks terrarias difficult combines that with smarter and more varied enemies even the npcs in terraria are far more talkative than the ones in starbound in fact if terrarias graphics were better there would almost be no reason to play starbound all in all starbound is only fun if you wish to build and explore with friends the game much like our own universe feels too sparse and dead to warrant anything other than a curious playthrough its very much just mining from world to world running into the same structures and biomes with little variation in between i can only recommend it if its heavily discounted on sale and you got friends who can tag along its nowhere near being the total package that was promised all those years ago buy terraria instead since not only will you be saving five bucks or so but youll have way more fun than going through a developers tired broken dreams 410,-1,0
211820,Starbound,this is a pretty honest review that i can give after playing through the story and going up until endgame to note it took me 3 days of playing to do this in all honestyi get the impression that work was put into areas that were not that important compared to others progression is linear and simple like so get thing use thing to get to new planets get new thing on new planets to make new new thing use new new thing to get to new new planets to get new new new thing this rinses and repeats for up to 4 times pros pretty lots of variety in some worlds interesting concepts nice dialogue plenty of vanity items to collect and display ship can be upgraded which wasnt a thing back in beta which is great theres actually a story now plenty of cool weapons cons there are only 4 rarities white green blue purple with no legendary weapons years in development yet feels incredibly basic still bugs and loading issues that cause you to stick in the air like a minecraft sever gross the story is and short the only truly legendary weapon is there are only 6 tiers of armor there are only 5 mounts crew are useless very little rare or exciting content that requires you to grind to be satisfied up until endgame its difficult to farm up resources for specific armor and it ends up being easier to loot weapons sell them to vendors and buy the armor various gates throughout the galaxy around various stars yet they all lead back to the ark even though you have a permanent teleport to there very little missions outside of the main story no reason to build houses other than for purely cosmetic reasons simply because you ship can hold everything all workshops have roughly 3 tiers of upgrading and dont unlock anything interesting you have to farm around planets for days to find themebased equipment pets are useless but admittedly cute so thats not all bad no large or legendary monsters there used to be some in beta that dropped epic gear challenge areas are no challenge and the loot is terrible mystery bags are just horrible literally horrible theres no point doing quests for the measly pixels and all of 1 matter manipulator core no epic rewards for finish the main story admittedly the most you get is literally a thank you card all in all its not worth it at the moment even with its official release it just feels very lackluster and barebones for what was meant to be a long time coming terraria made its way in less time and had way more content than this,-1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound holds a special place in my heart ive had the game since 01 and on multiple steam accounts the game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around but it never quite made it all of that changed with the recent 10 update marking the full release of the game you know have a fully pledged story with interesting and deep characters insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8 bosses talking about bosses they range from everything between a spider made of flesh to a penguin in a futuristic war machine every boss is very unique and their attacks never cease to suprise me there are 6 classes to choose from a robot a fish a plant a collection of gas an ape and of course human this sounds very bazare but as soon as you create your character you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory starbound is a sandbox gme and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be you can choose to never mine a single peice of ore never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds there is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture which comes in great use with the colony system the colony system consists of you creating a house and putting a colony deed inside the colony deeds cost 750 pixels the ingame currency you can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves or weapons and armor you can get everything from a merchant to a guard and they all come together with the procedural quest system quests that arent outpost or story related are always procedually generated yet theyre still all very unique and fun to do the people who will give them to you are either random npcs or inhabitants of your colony if you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific npc will he request to join you on your adventure as a companion it is only possible to have to companions with you at all times but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound the sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell as you can either get companions by making colonies ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries if you get enough companions on your ship you can have as many as you want just only two with you your ship will get bigger leaving you with more room there is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes and deep and interesting dungeons the weapons of starbound the weapons come in many shapes and forms some silly and some deadly they like so much else in this game have prodcedurally generated stats and looks which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find verdict if you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create and many unique enemies and weapons youre at the right place starbound is huge and for the gamer that likes to read there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to there are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets just waiting for you to find them 910,1,1

211820,Starbound,yall saying this games not as good as it used to be lmao at the time of writing this review i have somewhere around 700800 hours in starbound its an ok game yes things have changed yes there was neat things in the beta thats the thing it was a beta not everything is going to be the same honestly i think the new version is pretty ok because i got bored of the old versions to be fair it could have been better but yall are saying this is the better no mans sky no mans sky is 60 dollars this is 15 dollars stop expecting gold to come out of 15 dollars heck look what 60 dollars got no mans sky,1,1
211820,Starbound,ok so starbound its fun i mean you can build craft fight etc like terraria but in spaaaaaaaaaace or thats what people say that starbound is just terraria in space which is false to me anyway starbound is so much more openended expansive etc than terraria in my opinion anyway anyway now for my reasons as to why you should get the game just came out of early access a lot of people before were whining about how little there was to do but now that it updated to 10 you can expect a buttload of stuff i have reached the endgame and i still havent discovered everything myself so there will be no shortage of content easy modding and if you hypothetically do discover everything in the game there is a very active community just pumping out mods which are as simple to download as a click of a button hell you can even modify and make your own weaponsitems with a program like starcheat which is so easy to do even i managed to do it indepth exploration many people complain that all the planets are very similar and i think thats because they just skim the surface of the planet and then claim its not original enough im sure if they took the time to look the planet over youll discover so many cool places and strangely unique npcs just give it a chance before you hop onto the next radioactive star storycharacters ok so serious talk here shame on anyone who says the story is too simple like seriously screw you you should not be expecting oscar worthy writing from a game based on exploration and adventure its a wise decision by the devs to allow the games story to be simple and allow it promote exploration i wont spoil the story here but honestly get the game and experience it yourself the story and characters simple as they may be are extremely colourful and fun trust me better than terraria its better than terraria oh and another point stop comparing starbound to terraria but waah theyre both games with pixel graphics and crafting and no shut up you should never compare games together unless if they are extremely similar and starbound and terraria are two totally different experiences yes so what if they both have pixel graphics and crafting just because they share just those two aspects is so ground to start comparing the two next youll be telling me terraria is just 2d minecraft seriously stop it well that was my first review a few final words honestly just get starbound now even if you like it just a little its a wonderful and colourful experience unlike any other which really deserves more attention and cmon its only 10 bucks ps that last point about starbound being better than terraria was meant to be a joke not an actual point as to why you should get the game edit btw thanks to the guy who pointed out some grammatical mistakes i made,1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound is essentially terraria if terraria were a mediocre amalgamation of 15 genres at once the best word to describe starbound is tedious everything you do in this game is tedious mining takes forever and one misstep can get you killed this wouldnt be a problem if the controls worked well but they are extremely awkward also in survival mode you lose money and drop all your important items on death so if you die somewhere where you cant get them youre basically screwed farming is absolutely pointless the plants take way too long to grow planting the seeds and watering them take forever and it makes almost no money not to mention the fact that inventory management is incredibly awkward and frustrating exploration is boring as hell planets are all just generic biomes like desert and forest and plains also theres really no point to building a base on a planet because its just a waste of resources and you can just put all your things on your ship speaking of the ship it is very minimalistic theres no deep customization just exteremely expensive size upgrades also it is incredibly slow the way you travel between planets is just clicking on it and then waiting theres no interesting gameplay of any description the space travel is nothing but a gimmick the story really has no place in this game there is absolutely zero orignality to it just the standard find all the things to kill the giant monster id say the character interactions are pointless but you can barely even call them interactions you have no choices and the text always goes by too fast or too slow also the dialogue is dull as dishwater gear is horribly implemented it works similarly to something like borderlands or diablo so youll be getting tons of useless items that clutter your inventory and the combat is basic as hell every enemy functions more or less the same in conclusion this game is just a lesser terraria which is more expensive for no reason please dont waste your time and money and play terraria instead,-1,1
211820,Starbound,something ive always disliked about minecraft is that there was no real adventure to talk of this is the complete opposite always on the go always discovering new things,1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound is now out and i have completed the story so i can give a proper review of it i will be covering what i consider to be the main aspects of the game story810 the story of the game is that a big monster blew up earth and you escaped so you now have to find 6 artifacts that open the gate to the monster you find this out in the first hour the story has that bethesda feel where the game is like oh no this thing happened and you have to do something but you can just ignore it and do your own thing the story is an interesting aspect and actually takes you to the different planet types so you have time to upgrade your armor and weapons i think that story isnt completely necessary but it works well with the concepts already established combat910 the swordandgunplay is fun and focuses on dodging enemies your matter manipulator which is a building tool can be useful for creating cover and such but some enemies can go through walls each 2handed weapon has a special ability like grenade launchers and flashlights on guns or spin slashes and warp slashes on swords there is a variety of weapons allowing a ton of different playstyles the bosses in the game are also very well designed and offer up a challenge when you first fight them these bosses are located in developerdesigned dungeons that have many secrets located in them the combat never gets stale and fights are always interesting in one way or another exploration510 this aspect isnt the best part of the game you usually see the same biomes and monsters over and over and while some monsters are randomly generated by the end of the story youve seen all of the environments in the game already it is fun at the start of the game but it quickly gets stale and boring randomly generated dungeons are cool but you often find the same style of dungeon as well building910 building in the game is surprisingly deep and interesting the colony system offers up an interesting thing to do after the story the foreground and background building is similar to terraria but the game actually offers a good reason to build decorated houses so different tenants move in this is one of my favorite parts of the game and i have spent hours searching for the right materials for my houses which leads me to find new things in the game as well soundtrack1010 the soundtrack in this game is beautiful and the main theme is one of the most memorable tracks that i have ever heard in games i cannot stress enough that the soundtrack is worth buying and it adds a layer of charm to the game that i rarely see overall810 starbound is not the best game ever made but it definitely has a large amount of content that makes the game interesting for hours it seems that this game was a board that ideas were thrown at and some of those ideas stuck and mixed really well the game also has a kind of charm to it that you dont see in aaa games starbound has been a great project to watch as it grew from alpha to beta and finally to 10 starbound has in fact left orbit and hopefully will go interstellar in further updates,1,1
211820,Starbound,starbound started off promising and somehow got worse instead of better over the course of its dev cycle the game has fully released now but still feels virtually identical to the earliest builds the interface is clunky and terrible the progression system and balancing are all over the place the combat feels imprecise and every planet is basically a palette swap of the last at the end of the day it hasnt lived up to any of the promises chucklefish made during development and the final version is just boring save your money and get terraria instead,-1,1
211820,Starbound,do not buy this the developers are very rude and bans anyone who gives negative feedback on their forums edit 07082016 update to this the game is still incredibly bugriddled despite being released from beta and there are massive fps drops at seemingly random times im running a pretty highmid end gaming pc and most of the time it averages 20 fps in this game despite being able to run pretty much any other game on very high settings at gt72 fps if you want to buy it wait a little dont put your money down for it if you havent already done so this is not at all a full 10 version dont be fooled to add to it you make 15 trading cards but theres not a single novakid card despite there only being 7 races yet you can still manage to add a human game developer card thats even dafter than i am dont make a promise if you never want to do anything with it considering how many promises theyve made and failed to deliver on im starting to not be very surprised at all by them failing to deliver anything competent chucklefish was a mistake,-1,0
211820,Starbound,i wish i could play the game as it was 3 years ago in early access it felt to me like they crippled an amazing sandbox game in order to shove in a mediocre story,-1,0
211820,Starbound,time to rewrite this old thing now since its out of ea lets start with an admittedly bad metaphor imagine you see a food stand that makes sandwiches they have only one kind of sandwich the mystery sub but its promised to have the ingredients you like on it specifically pickles butter and white american cheese with just a little bit of mayo its also pretty cheap so you order a sandwich youre told itll be ready in five minutes those five minutes go by but still no sandwich so you go up and ask about it and the guy at the stand says he just started in the food service industry yesterday and he misjudged how long it would take since hes just starting out and he says itll be the best sandwich ever you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a little while after half an hour of waiting he finally gives you your sandwich you decide to open it to see whats in the best sandwich ever and you take a look at it mayo lots of mayo with one pickle a big glob of butter and half a piece of that awesome cheese you like all placed in different corners on the bread covered in that white goop in other words its technically what you ordered but its not half as good as you expected it to be and was given to you in much more time than you were told it was going to take originally starbound is that sandwich it has everything they said it would have exploration building even a few dark themes so technically everything they said it would be but there isnt nearly enough of that stuff and mostly samey fetch quests and grinding the allimportant story is shallow and derivative with every quest pretty much being scan random crap go though dungeon kill boss rinse and repeat over all its not a bad game it has plenty of stuff to keep you busy for a while with tons of cosmetics and building items i would even say the building system is better and more fun than terraria but there just isnt enough of everything else that would make it fun and unique as the old saying goes its as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle theres plenty of bad stuff that happened in development with the devs with the missed release dates and plenty of other problems im not going to go into it here if you havent heard of all the problems with the development and the devs themselves and are interested you can look it up yourself god knows youd get a better explanation from anyone other than me so ill judge it on what it has in it now not what happened in development in the past and for me in its current state its a resounding meh good for one or two playthoughs but youll probably get bored of it before you even get to experience most of the main features i still havent even tried the colony stuff and i did very little farming after 10 its only fifteen bucks though so if you think thirty or so hours is enough for that price then go for it i guess will you get as much play out of it as say terraria though no probably not im sure ive gotten my moneys worth out of it while it was in ea but i still dont like the game much so im giving it a negative review maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 for me,-1,1
211820,Starbound,in regards to the 10 update if you dont already have the game and were hoping that the big 10 update would add a new world of content that would change things forever youre probably going to be let down to summarize what the update does the earlyaccess version of the game essentially involved chucklefish cramming a bunch of content in the game to make it bigger they added singleplayer missions bosses and a certain level of progression but it was all kind of shallow and these elements were purely added just to have more things to do so finally what this big update does is gives these missions and the game proper plot and progression there are now lengthier more plotinvolved quests that make more sense than just im doing this quest because an npc told me to for the hell of it which is pretty much how quests were in earlyaccess the story is actually something that develops as you play rather than being explained in a dialogue box at the start like previous versions for the most part thats all this update does yes they did add some new stuff but the main purpose of this update was to refine and complete the game so that it no longer has that earlyaccess appearance and feel if you enjoyedthink youd enjoy the content that was in previous versions of the game then you might consider starbound worth a playthroughreplaythrough on the other hand if you werent previously impressed then theres probably not a whole lot added in this latest update that will change your mind regardless starbound as a whole is a really good game it may seem a bit lacking compared to terraria but its very easy to enjoy its unique elements such as exploration looting and colonization,1,1
211820,Starbound,after spending a while on this game and seeing it finally come out of early access i can say its not bad pros terraria in space space wizards races great modding community cons erichius horror crafting times why did they add them hotbar sucks,1,1
211820,Starbound,i have this game from long ago i have been waiting for 10 so that i can follow a formal story and is amazing i love exploring building growing a farm finding objects and making a museum getting all the pets pokemons searching for better weapons cooking doing quests i have played terraria junk jack and starbound i love the 3 of them each one is different i could say starbound has lot of depth love it i always play with someone i use the linux versio and she the windows one both work fine 1010,1,0
211820,Starbound,the game is terrible they ripped all meaningful content out of the game and all that is left is a husk they probably did this to hit 10 release the devs dont take criticism well i dont recommend buying this game oh and the storyline is pretty much star wars but with a giant orb with tentacles instead of an orb of laser cannons hero has home wrecked older wiser teacher gives purpose older wiser teacher had student who turned dark side hero goes on journey to gain strength hero fights evil student hero defeats big evil thing saving the galaxyuniverse,-1,1
211820,Starbound,i did not pay for early access i preordered a game with a release date of 2013 two years later another update still waiting for an explanation for the game finally released the game in 2016 three years late still waiting for an explanation,-1,0
211820,Starbound,i played this game a long time ago in beta trying it now i cant help but think i wish i was still playing the beta version becasue the release is a flat downgrade in terms of gameplay they removed a ton of content,-1,0
211820,Starbound,so close yet so far short terraria gt starbound long the quests are really boring mmo style scan this fight the boss get the artifact come back repeat or find this dude kill the hostage takers bring him back or bring me 4 silver ore make silver bars make the equipment and bring it to my friend id be fine with that but the rewards are totally not worth it most of the time you get a suprise bag wich contains either a mm upgrade module or a tech card that would be cool and all but you get a metric ton of these if you just explore the surface of a planet i wouldnt mind that too much but you need to complete the main story to unlock all shops in the outpost hub like areathe boss fights are really really really boring theyre not hard they just take a long long time to complete especially the last boss fight took me about 10 minutes but i didnt take much damage at all compared to terraria the boss fights are unsatisfying and boring building a colony on a planet has no real use you can upgrade your ship upto five times and at that point you have way too much spare space already yes building a colony is cool and all but there is no real point to it since all you really get from it is pixels the currency and in the endgame youll already have enough of them if you enjoyed terraria youll mostlikley enjoy starbound too because the gample is pretty much the same if you havent bought terraria yet buy it over starbound,-1,1
211820,Starbound,2016 upd lol this crap cant even run in 64x system after release characters still wiping due a bugs project completely ruined and even thousands of mods cant save it ty for teaching not to buy early access games burn in hell chuclefish 2015 do not buy it before release just dont buy believe me fckn 3 years early access r u kiddin me,-1,1
211820,Starbound,the game is like space terraria but much less to do you know the saying the journey is more important than the destination well the journey sucks in this game and there is no destination pros space so many interesting worlds and sets missions and story have great aesthetic ships are cool decent variety of planets building is easy and the variety of building materials allows for a lot of creativity building your ship can be super cool there are some very neat random dungeons the races are very creative the game is fun with friends cons very very limited things you can craft compared to a game like terraria hunger is stupid crew system is super underwhelming a lot of things in the game that feel worthless such as pets crafting weapons buying basically anything from merchants way way way too easy to find everything in the game every tear of ores can be found in around 30 minutes of being on your first planet with the ore and then you never need to mine for it again the game has a very short cap you finish everything you can do in the game after hardly any work quests that arent in the main story are abysmal there are like 3 different quests and they all suck go get this kill this or bring this to this person they terrible payout so there is no incentive to do them at all money is super easy to come by and not used for like anything making it virtually worthless the character customization options are actually very disappointing both at the character creation and throughout the game the game is extremely linear for a sandbox you have very specific paths to take until the end where is seems like they thought oh we need to give players multiple options for armor in a sandbox game summary in the end a lot of the gameplay mechanics seem not thought through and kind of worthless the game is very incoherent at times and worst of all when you get to final tier of armor it is the most disappointing and unsatisfying thing in the game the only way id recommend this game is if you really really liked building and making a town even then there are better games for that because that is the only thing in this game that requires any effort but that has no payout besides being able to see a ton of people in your town its very disappointing because the beginning of the game is so fun and new but as that feeling goes away you get a very big disappointment i hope for the game to improve as im sure the developers will continue to add to it but until then it is a no from me,-1,1
211820,Starbound,with over 60 hours played i can guarantee you ten of those hours sloughing through the decievingly short main campaign and grinding for resources while the rest of the time i was playing an okay vertical stardew valley aside from accompanying a friends mission with a banjo loadout or trying out the newer mods that werent fortunate enough to be merged with the final game the base game leaves much to be desired one of the biggest complaints is how badly the framerates could get fudged in a 2d platformer you typically see a good 2030 frame loss every time there are particle effects on screen a large sprite is rendered or god forbid witness a large sprite with alpha channels while hovering over it with the research tool to put it into perspective the credit sequence which is crawling text with a slideshow beside it amounts to a whopping 14 fps thats impressive it was also a fitting finale that summed up how this game shipped through massive incompotence yet kept afloat by a passionate community that has just the right amount of obnoxiousness to be unappealing yet get work done if you are a fan of platformers with an expansive sandbox building system this is very likely a purchase as it is now i could not personally recommend this to anyone else until they revisit the main campaign postgame content and what is most likely the most shameful resource hog i have seen in a while kudos to the first patch that landed however as it effectively kept our server from crashing every two hours from a memory leak these kinds of changes along with what the modding community has been able to accomplish within the last week could mean good things later this year special thanks to nutmeg shoutout to simpleflips love you mom,-1,1
211820,Starbound,so after a 5 year wait its finally released after all that time with content updates and changing basically everything in the game chucklefish has managed to deliver something truly dull and uninspiring starbound is a fabulous premise a universe full of potential after spending some time with the final release i am left with one question thats it the quests and story that ive been waiting for the biggest let down the main quest consists of 2 types of mission 1 find a settlement of the specified race and scan their furniture 2 travel to a premade level and fight a boss at the end the side quests consist of 3 types of missions 1 deliver an object or escort a person to another person on the planet often times this second person is right next to the first person 2 kill an enemy for someone 3 collect ore or some other item for someone the rest of the game as best as i can tell is collecting stuff and building other stuff you can set up a colony but why would you so you can get more tedious and boring quests so you can have a farm a universe of endless possibilities and farming is the most creative thing you could come up with one other thing i noticed is that the monsters seem to have gotten less unique there are some that still seem to be randomly generated per planet but there are a few that are on every planet i dont know if thats a bug or not but it wasnt like this before so after a 5 year wait im left with a game that has redefined blandness and squandered potential no i still cant recommend this game i dont even want to bother finishing it just to finish it at least the soundtrack is still good but thats it,-1,1
211820,Starbound,edit fixed some grammar here and there during the early alpha i was like this is good theres lot of potential had fun for a few days especially in multi with a friend but still it seemed too much unfinished and so we decided to wait for the final version a year or so later when the final launched we tried it again it seemed fun at the beginning they fixed something here and there balanced it out it was engaging again for a few more days i now have played i think a dozen hours on the final version between single and multiplayer and finally decided to write this review steam reports more hours because i forgot it open a couple of times the dev team sadly fell in the old procedural development rabbit hole and understandably couldnt get out of it the content seems a lot but its really not the whole mass of the content is in the graphic assets but for the rest theres almost nothing let me get in detail 1 there are like 3 quests repeated over and over the whole galaxy including the main questline the superficiality of the sidequests is evident when you find different villages and you always get the same quest literally the same one on every planet from 10 cramped up npcs this is also apparent with the main questline that consists of those 45 ad hoc maps unreachable otherwise where at the end you get to kill a boss and boy they are all easy to beat 2 another major turnoff is the main story i really think that making the main questline obbligatory for the player goes against everything that a sandbox game is 3 the subbiomes are another big problem they are very superficial too you basically find always the same 23 ones gnomes slime small houses underground etc these subbiomes never give you anything special nor they have any background story or anything the crates you find and you always find them by the dozens have always the same loot because each of the few different star types has the same exact loot for all its planets 4 and then we have the colonies system you find a planet build a house and a random guy teleports in he does nothing he will rarely give you one of the same 23 quests they are exactly the same as the sidequests in the game and then when he wants hell give you finally the chance to hire him but you dont actually need a crew in the game and it has no utility whatsoever i dont recommend this game maybe only discounted and if you plan to play in multiplayer with a friend otherwise dont waste money,-1,1
211820,Starbound,that moment when crafting food more interesting then playing,1,1
211820,Starbound,ive given this game three years and finally came back and finished the final release with a buddy of mine and at the end of this glorious storyline he summed it up perfectly this game feels like it was completed by a couple of high schoolers none of which have any creativity literally nothing but fetch quests like a single player mmo it gets repetitive really fast if youve already played terraria and beat it this game scratches that itch that sandbox 2d itch if you havent dont waste your time and money on this one go play terraria,-1,1
211820,Starbound,tldr i wouldnt buy it unless you have a friend that has it but even then i duno pretty much mod the crap out of the game to make it worth while cause i duno what the developers were doing over the last few years oh after editing a bit i figured out what im exactly feeling about this game it feels like this should have been the beta and now we are waiting on the real game so this review is my first and probably terrible but it is mine and if anything i hope the 5 people on my friends list that have this in their wishlist are a bit more informed and hopefull avoid this shallow game cool stuff first couple of story missions space ship upgrading granted its only room sizes we still cool multpile races different planet types trying to think of more procedural weapons maybe cool special moves on weapons underwater and outerspace bases crew recruting colonytenants building in this game is a breeze and beautiful so it has that going for it i guess ill give it that hand created enemies boring but rewarding random fetch quests you kill some cool units sometimes and ive mostly gotten cool things as rewards rainbow knight not cool stuff story missions after first couple space magic is really dumb i wanted to like it but they should have left that to terraria god theres a lot no novakid npcs or tenants i feel like they dont even exist i guess i could play one crafting is like straight up trash as far as weapons are concerned magma ocean and poison worlds no reason to explore except for ore and only place to really use the useless boat i felt like the techs were cooler in the betas back a couple years ago hoverbike to many giant hills to really take advantage of it and it takes tons of damage the crew recruiting is cool the crew members themselves are useless omega super god aweful boring enemies stupid enemy ai that just runs into you over and over really boring not so random random enemy generation cool concept but ive seen the same face on the same body type 100 time but this time he has spikes on his back pets are about as dumb and usless as the crew sadly once again cool concept unique weapons or legendaries are boring and usually really weak i did like the magna orb though this is going to be to long maybe moons are dumb go to moon with nothing on it except for fuel that is just plain old fluff content asteroids are meh less boring then moons but no real reason to go there everything about the ui sucks especially for chests you need mods basically a lot of stuff is just bland except for all the things that were once previously mods of some sort that got inject into the official game like railing was really cool and the novakid stuff which i found out was really a original idea but evolved from a much cool race call the umm anyemods or something anodynes ya i dont know im going to keep playing it because im seeing some interesting mods that change things to better fit how i want to play but i dont think i can recommend this game to anyone mods seem to be the only way im going to make it through my first playthrough because it is just so boring i played this thing a bit around the time of the initial release and then kept tabs on the dev blog like had it as my home page for a while and i felt like what they were showing was really cool and then it just took them forever to make i am not a developer so i dont know what it takes to develope a game like this but when like right out of the gate they were like its going to be out blah blah or wait no later blah i grew a bit skeptical of the game really coming out so after a few years this game was a complete distant memory so where are we im what a week or more after the release of 10 after not playing this game since pretty much 3 4 years ago and it still feels like it has no idea what it wants to be the long of it for as long as this has become is that i guess i was expecting more from a game that seemed to have so much going for it this games just regular bland maybe i duno maybe i was expectin personalized quests for each race or something i mean so far the quest system that i was looking forward to is just really really bad i liked the space station mission and was like this is cool then there was the floran one and was like woah i really like this and by the hylotl and avian or we the birds were called again i was pretty much like ya this is just boring now oh and jesus that looking for artifact things with the manipulator that was just badya just bad really bad i really wanted to love this game a game shouldnt make you feel sorry for it ya know like woah this and this is kinda cool but i dont know what happened with the rest of you sorta feeling,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,well what can i say i got 1200h hours played yes i bought the completely overkill pack the dlcs and supported the game but after microtransactions and more and more dlcs i had to give it a bad review they were promising free content and instead we got paid dlcs and microtransactions so overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making dont get me wrong its one of my favorite games but if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on dlcs that will come out over time because even with a 75 sale on everything the game with everything costs 33 and after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest dlc so what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game the content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think also playing with publics people you dont know can be pretty annoying its ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them so if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on dlc and maybe microtransactions for weapon skins which are cosmetic and get yourself into a group to play payday with,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,update it appears that starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills this is a step in the right direction but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before i can recommend the game original review my friend doctor insano said it better than i could so heres the thing i have 2000 hours in this game i have a youtube channel of me doing death wish heists solo without bots i did the tabula rasa challenge solo without bots unmodded weapons before grinder you could say i loved this game at one point that time is gone overkill has repeatedly broken promises they directly said before release we will not ever have microtransactions and yesterday october 15 2015 they added microtransactions this game is not free to play with microtransactions this game is not cheap with microtransactions this game has a reasonably priced base game with 100 of dlc in order to purchase this game with all dlc you must pay 130 outside of a sale on top of this 130 price tag are microtransactions justthink about that the price of this game alone is more than the price of two aaa games overkill then has the audacity to triple dip on this by adding microtransactions last year there were a series of whats next audio files hinting at something after a month of daily audio files being released it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isnt released until 2016 and an ingame baseball bat last year we had crimefest where the top reward overkill was to release was a mystery this mystery ended up being john wick a movie tiein they were going to make and release anyway last year some of the rewards for crimefest were fbi files ingame stats and a new enemy these werent released until this year the fbi files ended up being a reimplementation of a community web page and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle this year overkill did a hype train event by preordering dlc we would get hypefuel points with enough hypefuel rewards for the community would be unlocked in order to boost sales overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels called infamy the first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome ingame masks the next 20 levels released in infamy 20 provided new masks and experience point bonuses so you can infamyfaster i call this mask pack 20 it took overkill 14 months to release this in response people started refunding their dlc preorders in response to that overkill released the dlc early so no one could get refunds the latest hypetrain reward has yet to be released in response to this i completely stopped buying dlc i have no dlc at all that has been released since mask pack 20 and most recently overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will never do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods overkill does not deserve your money they do not deserve any money they have repeatedly broken their promises to the community they have insulted the community they have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall overkill shame on you i truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you am i angry you bet your i am but more than that im just so disappointed youve truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats i truly hope your company goes out of business,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,another game that goes sour because of a cashgrab from the publishersdevelopers update overkill has slightly backpeddled on the microtransactions by making them a rare drop and reducing the price but this is still unnacceptable when the initial promise was no microtransactions ever their reputation has been tarnished and i am still going to be wary of spending any more money on this company,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i used to like you overkill your game was great but after the recent activities you seem to be missing the actual point of the game by miles skins crates medieval weapons a ton of storyunfriendly heisters trading and microtransactions really i bought all your dlc followed your every post your every update your every move with this game but lately you turned payday 2 into another mainstream cashgrab my friends and i had a lot of fun but this stops because of you and your greed you ed up simple as that edit1 overkills community mods also began deleting negative feedback in the forums censorship is the last water drop in an already flooded garage im just so done with this edit2 they finally removed microtransactions reason enough for me to play the game again however their mistakes are too many for me to have a positive attitude towards them for now edit3 if you are a new player i advise you to not look at edit1 as it was created the same week as this review though it is still worth a look depending on your opinion on such matters also fixed formulations to clarify,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,the public play is a toxic and unpleasant to play with people you dont know as kicking without reason is very common especialy if you are in the first 100 lvls its a great coop game if you have up to 3 friends that play with you its a real blast but just to buy it to play public is really not an option the new skilltrees are more clear and they took out many of filler skills that wer completely useless and most skills got combined or mixed in some way you have a great choice of mods that make the game more clear to playdidnt play a long time dont know what mods are fresh and aktiv in development verdict i would say if you have atleast 2 friends that would play with you go for it otherwise get another game playing public with the broadside of this community is pointless my review is going to stay negativ even if its not a bad game got some worse in my library,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a good way to ruin a playerbase is to add microtransactions payday 2 did it flawlessly here paying for weapon skins is already bad but tying weapon stats into a paid rng drop give me a ing break edit the moderators of the forums also went full sjw httpsteamcommunitycomapp218620discussions8490123197943804165 edit 2 paying 20 for a skin in one of their forced dlcs being able to pay for stackable xp and money buffs for the team disgusting,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,payday 1 was a great game it was a simple fun game about robbing banks and making dosh payday 2 started off as an improvement then dlc kept happening balancing never occurred bugs were ignored in favor of more payed content now after stating theyd never have microtransactions have begun the exact same thing as csgoexcept its actually paytowin weapon skins give you stats please do not play this game the devs have become greedy s and do not deserve any more money,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,converted to pay to win after the crimefest 2015 event moreover they did promise not to add this kind of payments back in 2013 httpwwwgamespotcomarticlespayday2wonthavemicrotransactions11006410303 edit 13112015 today they added even more p2w elements in the form of stackable teamwide xp and cash bonuses moreover they released the last part of the cop completely overkill pack was only on sale under the hype train event for 20 20 but the long awaited content ended being a crate and a drill where you get a random skin out of 25 with a random wear and random boosts,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,step 1 introduce waypoint bonuses in a game community invite your friends step 2 introduce microtransactions via very minor dlcs and keys for your crate drops step 3 reap the whirlwind,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a moneyobsessed pale imitation of the first game payday 1 was essentially left 4 dead except bank robbers its a simple formula that worked really well the long objectiverich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale gunplay was satisfying enemies were challenging and the dlc added a new class to screw around with a few maps and secrets got updated as free updates payday 2 is nothing like the first game the sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game in lieu of lengthy interesting campaigns each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives prepare to see the same areas again and again stealth has been overemphasized across the boardkilling yourself to restart is a common occurrence the difficulty just isnt there compared to the first game either the matchmaking is also random gen and a complete messgone are the easy lobbies of the first game it gets worse the unlock system is heavily dependent on rng customization is rng everything in this game is rng except leveling the game has had dlc after dlc heaped on it during a sale it becomes a reasonable price when its off sale expect to pay 50 just to unlock a decent amount of content the game has blatant product placement john wick is shoved in your face as a free character why this doesnt get more negative feedback ill never know the new dlc came free of charge with a caveat now you can enjoy csgo and team fortress 2 crates and pay 250 to unlock them as if the game couldnt become more moneygrubbing and obsessed with profit did i mention the crates are factored into the rng loot meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them you can still lose out by getting them when you dont want them game use to have a modding community too overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch maybe theyll fix this i dont know am i against all dlc not at all plenty of games make great use of dlc but herein lies my point this is not a freetoplay game this isnt a game in which the dlc is cosmetic you have to pay for the game then the dlc which encompasses characters weapons and campaigns is also paid for the game has product placement blatantly inserted into it it then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations this game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall for what should be a simple left 4 dead style cooperative game the amount of grind and payforcontent in tis game is absolutely absurd all in all a disaster right from the start it just took some people longer to see that,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,wow what a shame this game is a pay to win turdfest the original game was pretty good this thing derailed and went to town though just play the first one and youll be happy,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,please purchase the gage positive review dlc pack for only 599 most of the core game features are dlc dont expect to use grenades sniper rifles light machine guns or explosives dont expect to host any of the new heists and dont expect to have good weapon modifications without paying again it was an honestly fun horde shooter before the dlc power creep took hold also the requirements call for multiple cpu cores when the game can only run on one overkill quality and all that,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,overkill stated this game would never have microtransactions httpforumssteampoweredcomforumsshowthreadphpt3127521 but then they changed thire tune and release it as a day 1 award for crimefest overkill has recently added microtransactions to the game with paid skins that provide stat bonuses as long as the game contains paid skins that provide stat bonuses this negative review will stay shame on overkill for lying,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,edit this game is pretty much a lost cause at this rate so long payday 2 i love this game i really do but microtransactions as a free reward no thank you robbing places might be part of the game but robbing my wallet shouldnt be,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,had the community work hard to earn free rewards then the said rewards where microtransactions,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,im kinda surprised i can write a review without buying dlc,-1,0
218620,PAYDAY 2,this game was fun prior to the october 15th 2015 addition of random dropbased microtransactions remember keys and crates from tf2 and csgo the same approach is being used here but in adding this system overkill harshly nerfed all existing weapons including those which players paid for as part of dlc packages in order to give players an incentive to pay for skins via microtransactions existing equipment has been made insufficient to achieve the challenges that already existed in the game prior to the launch of this system we arent being urged to buy microtransactions in order to take on more difficult challenges added alongside these new skins were being robbed of our existing tools tools we earned through hours of gameplay or purchased for real money and then sold a chance of regaining the same level of power we enjoyed previously there were plenty of good ways to add a skin system to a game like payday 2 overkill found a truly terrible way and implemented it i cant recommend supporting this game or this company,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i played this game for a very long time i was willing to put up with the terrible desynch and the gradual powercreep because it was fun and as a cooperative game it wasnt a huge problem however recently they added csgostyle weapon crates that you get randomly for completing heists opening them requires you spend real money inside you get weapon skins which give stat bonuses to your weapons they added this feature as the first free reward the community got for completing a bunch of milestones during the runup to the yearly crimefest literally well done on the challenges your free reward is an opportunity to give us more money and make the game paytowin basically overkill i used to think they were just incompetent at managing their messaging toward their community now its clear that they literally dont give a beyond hoovering money up,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,after almost 1600 hours buying every dlc up to alesso full price on release i can now say i no longer support or even like overkill the addition of microtransactions is not only a complete contradiction to statements they made earlier but also an idiotic decision this game has over 120 of dlcs and now youre going to add 250 microtransactions on top of that no thanks the game is great the company is far from it,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,rest in peace payday 2 now you are payday global offensive ps early it was a good game but now it is a weapons skins simulator,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i cant help but feel betrayed by this game after spending many hours and putting in plenty of money for dlcs to be rewarded by having to pay more money is beyond ridiculous a week ago the whole pd2 community came together to show these devs that we appreciated what they did for us despite the already extortionately priced and unnecessary amount of dlc around 25 lost count then our reward for our efforts and loyalty was another way for them to squeeze money from us im sorry but this is just not right all this aside from the written word from said devs stating that microtransactions would never be introduced into the game so with lies about in game content and more lies about dlc which has been purchased and never released the completely overkill pack fyi its hard to trust overkill anymore i for one will not spend another penny on this game its a shame as the game is pretty good its just not pay to win good,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,paid skins affecting actual in game stats not just mearly cosmetics great game being destroyed by scum business practices this review will remain negative until they fix it insert sheekles heekles joke here,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,warning overkill are banning people for leaving negative reviews httpimgurcomcoiy2qg i have not posted anything in their forums for almost a month and they slap this ban down on me for absolutely no legitimate reason besides for the fact that i left this review httpimgurcomjhmfo1w the developers have also gone out of their way to state that they have not been partaking in the forums following the massive moderator strike which puts a lot of clarification that they are instead spending their efforts into stalking the stores negative review page and banning people who leave them criticism httpimgurcomicle4af i used to be a game developer with morals like you but then i took a community reward microtransaction pay2win store to the knee httpwwwgamespotcomarticlespayday2wonthavemicrotransactions11006410303 seriously httpimgurcom0yoy7jo what the fck is wrong with you overkill,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,hey so this is a game that i really liked at first i played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an upandcoming indie team i was right it was fun payday was an enticing original game that knew not to take itself too seriously i very much liked the idea the sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original as well as elaborating on the purposely farfetched story i thought payday 2 was an amazing game that all changed when pay2win arrived they started with a few cheap dlcs whats the harm right pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point these days its a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little i honestly prefer a few dlcs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesnt forget you exist cod however i soon found out that what payday 2 had planned was far worse than anything call of duty has ever done overkill released dlc after dlc after dlc after dlc they just kept coming each one more elaborate than the last if you call paying 5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate they incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purposedefeating advantage theyre essentially payed cheat codes in the sense that a lot of these dlcs pretty much make the game ez mode i honestly think that overkill does not give a about their community anymore all they seem to know or care about these days is that dlc what really me the off is this new black market update or whatever the they called it its literally a copypaste of the arms deal update from csgo literally the same ing thing i mean i understand that theyre purposely making this update resemble counterstrike but i dont get why obviously its because csgo keys and crates have made valve a fortune but whats with the unapologetic ripoff of valves style are they trying to be ironic because its not ironic its not funny or witty or clever or even mildly amusing the whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes overkill look like the moneygrubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are i will never recommend this game to anyone a couple of years ago i would have told all of my friends about how fun and original payday 2 was and i did but this game and its devs are garbage now for the love of god do not give these idiots your money,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,just added microtransactions after promising never to do so as if the nonstop stream of lackluster dlc wasnt bad enough avoid,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i put a lot of time into this game relatively to how much i play then microtrasatctions like csgo but much worse skins affect stats even after this httpwwwgamespotcomarticlespayday2wonthavemicrotransactions11006410303 which yes is from awhile ago but this isnt something to go back on i like this game but im joining in the boycott until this gets changed overkill pls edit now they made it worse with update 90 i cant make my review more negative,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,oh well look at my hours played now look at my vote for this game wanna know why crimefest ii day 1 microtransactions says it all update as of 13th of november 2015 more t was added you dont like stat boosts on skins here have some skins with teamboosts thx for supporting us with buying a 20 dlc here have a random skin that may look like and that may have a statboost that no one wanted or asked for,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,payday 2 is a fantasticly fun game which gets even more enjoyable with friends the gunplay is nice the skills give tons of different playstyles the heists are enjoyable and the music is amazing i would completely recommend this game to anyone if it was made by a different developer sadly its made by overkill see overkill is known for keeping in touch with their community and thats not a bad thing its great actually if they actually ing listened to their community that is instead of just pretending to give a about the people that play it overkill loves money never forget it they release tons of dlc did a whole completely free event back in the spring where you had to buy dlc to unlock more rewards and now did another completely free event where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts now whether or not you consider this pay 2 win or not is your opinion as it is a coop game but its still ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event have them work hard to get all the rewards then day ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts this is a great game it was made by a developer if you want to still spend your money on it go ahead but be ready to feel like when overkill once again manages to over their community for that cash,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,come on overkill i love this game seriously i really do i havent wracked up thousands of hours no because i dont game much but this was the first game in my steam library to break a hundred hours and then 200 not long after i was addicted i was hooked i joined facebook groups dedicated to organizing allnighter crime sprees on skype and teamspeak it was phenomenal the gameplay was amazing the game was based almost entirely on skill and persistence teamwork now come on guys i could forgive the dlc stream i was working full hours back when it started so i could keep up i could forgive the letdown of crimefest i didnt pay that much attention anyway you guys went from consistently updating the game with actual improvements focused on bug fixes detailed missions and new weapons that created whole new playstyles to microtransactions nerfing weapons to practically make the skins mandatory and not even nerfing them well resulting in the entire balance between weapon types being thrown off breaking the game we get it you want our money youre a game developer who only a couple of years ago was fresh on the block then you managed to crank out an absolute masterpiece you couldnt handle the boom in media attention and community growth and you got carried away you know what i can forgive that i can forgive you for trying microtransactions and skins and drops i can forgive you for trying new things you are now a new big game developer on the block instead of a new small one youll make mistakes i can forgive that but i cannot forgive the lying and manipulation youve done to the community one of the best gaming communities outside the professional gaming circuit a false apology refusals to remove the failed tests despite the damage theyve done news blackouts we trusted you guys you gave us an incredible game you were doing so well we would have handed our wallets to you if you asked but thats the thing you didnt ask wed like our wallets back this hurt to write,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,overkill the mannconomy does not ing work in a game that costs money the mannconomy that affects stats of preexisting guns does not work in a game period this is not a game worth ing 135 in dlc,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,although my review shows not recommended i do recommend this game specially if you have friends to play with its way more enjoyable i got a bit salty after some of overkills actions and they have redeemed themselves for the most part updated november 23rd 2016,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,welcome to update 100 payday era where the mts are dead from here forward and the safes can be open for free no more 505 games no more stockholders giving full influence its back to where we started this is the new payday but seriously thanks overkill for listening to the community and making update 100 the best thing to happen to the game since the dentist heists,1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,with the addition of paid skins the game is now an oversaturated dlc fest with microtransactions avoid if possible will adjust review accordingly if the skins system is reworked to not be a microtransaction cash grab or is removed entirely but as it stands right now its shameful and disgusting,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,so from this point forward the drills are no more and theyve finally started listening to their community after half a year personally i think its about eight months too late but its nice to see them axing the thing that split the community apart does this excuse their past flaws though no it really doesnt theyve pulled some scummy moves in the past year with dlc thats literally useless to their infamous lies to past promises payday 2 is a very fun game if you can catch it on a sale and get the boatload of dlc for dirt cheap you have a good amount of gameplay there however take caution when buying future products from this developer theyve claimed to start listening to the community but i still have my doubts,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,dont spend your money on a game that is developed by liars that are twisted and blinded by their greed this game is 100 community driven but overkill seems to be fine with ing us all in the,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,when are you removing stats from skins were not bye ovk iest devs on earth since 2015,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,well i see overkill fked everyone over yet again i dont play this game anymore i havent for around 34 months now from when this review was made and i dont plan on coming back to it again especially at the rate that its going can i just point out before i state the obvious that this pss poor compnay has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people are actually tired of their st they promised things like safe house customization a new enemy and a few other things here and there any of that happen in the past 2 years no have they stated anything about any of those nope not to mention the appauling dlc that they keep putting out and saying its new content when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heii its basically saying were too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons now then onto the main issue that they just put out but lets start by going over why other games do this tf2 csgo and do it the right way overkill completely misses it talk about a copy paste job its just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist httpiimgurcom6txbcefgifv oh should i add that they litterally did the same thing with a csgo map yeah lazyness to a whole new level want something better that fits them to a t this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9bdyrbdmjpi the steam page for payday 2 has been updated based on your feedback weve made it clear that payday 2 will have no microtransactions whatsoever please tell me you fsticks over at overkill are joking with this talk about hypocrits 1 the way csgo and tf2 do it these games do it right you are not required to buy any skins at all they prove no stat boost no promises on getting more kills ammo anything its purely cosmetic you arent even forced to get any at all and they dont shove it in your face the way overkill does it you can only get a safe from a card drop and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill and youre set on a rng based kind of system oh thats just like csgo though not really in csgo you can get drops for ffffffking freeeeeee and they dont change anything just make it look better unless its a stattrak i suppose plus any skin you get you can sell for steam currency to buy better skins or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the trade oh you dont want the crate csgo would say well just go sell it on the market and get something that youd like instead payday oh you dont want the safe dont have any money for the drill tough st bltch 2 the skins in payday 2 ruin the stats theyve made it to where skins give weapons boosts my question is why that kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns youve ever used in the game get a particular skin and thats it why bother using anything else i think they should scrap this entirely make the skins be drops or better yet why not just get rid of them and oh i dont know make some actualy levels instead of cash grabbing from your fans 3 off topic kind of all of the moderators are now sjw apparently since practically the whole sdding community hates this the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way instead of oh i dont know taking it as fking criticism thats reaching a whole new low people dont get rid of it learn from it im actually with the community on this they hate it i hate it and i dont even play the damn game anymore for crying out loud and im with the community on this ending why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me i havent touched it in months will i come back to it fk if i know at the rate theyre going probably not especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while i might come back here and there but not like i used to its ridden with bugs pointless dlc padding and now this boiiocks stay far away maybe if they get their head out of their a and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it but untill then me and even my friends that play it advise you to stay away from this garbage fight for your games and how they should be made why is this such a bad thing quit letting developers run you instead make them do the game correctly dont make people like overkill turn into ea push them back demand more from them not less this is the reason this st happens fight against it make this turn out like deus ex mankind divided make them regret this stupid decision that they did make them admit that they fked this up even though i dont enjoy the game anymore at all i at least want the people that do to have some respect from overkill here overkill this is for you httpi1kymcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeed00063546529bgif edit their final day and guess what they added a jump animation really thats it its not even client sided its based off of other players there is litterally no difference thats your guys big ending to this a jumping animation that does absolutely nothing you people are a fking disgrace so i found this httpiimgurcomxtyvomnpng let that just sink in a bit to show what little tws they truly are,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i got 700h on record bought almost all dlcs and now the developer breaks promises no microtransactions and adds paid stat boosting skins to weapons cant recommend the game as long as this feature is not changed to at least only cosmetical skins,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,payday 2 would be a much better game if its developers respected its audience the game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of dlc which brings a noticeable power creep in despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just preorders it is a fourplayer coop shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of aicontrolled police if youre familiar with left 4 deads model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities thats the model payday 2 went with as you level your character up though you get new abilities and you acquire new weapons to fight with mask customization is probably the highlight of the game with there being an enormous collection of masks materials for them to be made out of patterns to put on them and colors for those patterns to be you can make some really fun stuff play a lot and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask youre wearing but any mask in your collection that said while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here i cannot recommend the game first off for gameplay reasons in overkill probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots if youre the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear and the game gives you the tools to do that there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy what youll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapidfire as possible unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable this means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category you can easily narrow each category down to one or two best guns and the others are only there if youre comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using then of course there are the business practices of overkill the game was profitable based on preorders alone and while free content and map packs are added so is a lot of cheap cashin dlc that often includes paytowin mechanics at first you needed dlc to have grenades now you need dlc to have the powerful molotov cocktails and a separate dlc for the useful ninja stars do you want the best gun possible then you need to buy the mod pack dlc even content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game john wick was added to the game as a playable heister supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer most recently as a reward for completing challenges ahead of crimefest payday 2 was given a cratekey system just like in csgo where as a thanks to the community now a portion of your postheist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a drill to open it where it will then give you a random weapon skin that just like with the dlc makes your weapon stronger is there fun to be had sure but there are other games out there that are just as fun but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets go play one of them instead,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,overkill have repeatedly lied in the past about never adding microtransactions to payday 2 which is exactly what they did today for betrying the community you get a gentle downvote for your game,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,this was a good game as it stands now however its drowning in dlc the complete package costing over 100 without any sales and now theyve introduced microtransactions something theyve promised they wouldnt several times crates and keys la csgo which affect gun stats as a free update which the community had to work for abandon all hope developers no longer care for their fanbase,-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,the game was very good sure there were a lot of dlcs but those were optional however paid weapon skins with bonus stats are t,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,mega edit a year later edition so they set the drills for freenow all the new safes are free to openall the old ones still require to buy a drill to open today 300516 overkill preannounced the update 100 for the gamebasically they bought the game rights back from the publisher505gamesand announced that the priced drills will be removed for all the upcoming safesthis basically mean that the safes will keep dropping but that they will automatically be open for freeno more drillsyou can still trade the skins but no need to use drills to open the safesall the old safes will still require a drill to be opened but they will remove the drop for them now this means they actually better now no more overkill liars kind ofthey decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the payday 2 franchisestill tho as stated by producer at overkill here wwwtwitchtv they said that all the mts idea was an overkill idea not a publisher one so yeahnice commercial practices right there now that they said that they are gonemtsi still want to wait and see what times have to give usthey still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the gamestill have to fix ton of bugs here since the game betadiscutable dlcs quality to a too high pricefor the contentquality so as last statement i would say well done overkillfor the roll backstill tho strangefirst they say its profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymorekeep doing thisbut really now focus on providing some high quality content my review will still remain negative until i dont see a even more step in the right directionthis is a start a great start but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again editcouple days later editionjust to be more cleari think that is not all forgiven at allas i said up theres still ton of stuff to fixfeature promised since the release of the game still not releaseddiscutable quality of the dlcs and lots of other stuffoh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that force them to develop mts wellmaybe its truemy opinion t or max 50 truewhat is sure is that overkill agreed with the introduction of mtsmaybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knowspeople think that after several months after the black market update aka skins and mts introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for freeso basically theres still a lot of stuff from overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better old review will remain here as reminder of what happened as you can see from my hours on recordim a payday 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this gamedevs since the start lovelly ideas and a developer different from the other onesi saw a lot of things changesome were cool and fantasticsome less but overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they dont like and as always i was there enjoying the gamea developer that actually listen to the user requestfeedback is hard to find this daysthats one of the reason why overkill was my favorite game devsome months ago they started releasing really low quality and buggy dlc at full price every monththe last one was the worst of all timechyvarly dlcand now at the time of this reviewthey introduced microtransaction in the gamejust to let you know they always said that they will never introduce microtransaction in the game because they said they absolutly dont like that kind of thingsand today theyve done the exact opposite edit21102015 in the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushedlast moment card drop called the wolf card that gives you a drill for freenice move overkill nice movebut its not what we askedthe microtransaction have to leave foreverthey never was something to add to this game as almir said at the game launch weve made it clear that payday 2 will have no microtransactions whatsoever shame on you if you thought otherwise this is someting that have to be removedyou lied to us overkilland thats what you got tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world edit251015 worst crimefest evera fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as rewards the next time try harder and remove the microtransaction edit071115 player seem to be loving it almir listo im not so sure about that almircurrently at 76 on steam33 on metacritic the absolute disaster of the almir ama on reddit almir dodging the question live on twitch wwwtwitchtv edit131115 they ed up the game even more now glad theynot heard our feedbackintroducing even more pay2win microtransactionrandom crew bonus at a price of half a dlcand the not so surprising after all this mess cop reward a 125 random skin with random specs after 6 months of waiting gingg overkilleven the moderators here on steam and on reddit refuses to moderate the forums again and support this madness,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,my reward for a heist was the option to pay the devs more money no thanks ill uninstall instead,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i cant believe im saying this but id rather have goldfarb as lead designer for payday 2 again i paid over 100 dollars for your dlc i bought the preorder pack i played the beta i bought all of your dlc including several gift copies of pdth for friends i bought both ing hypetrain packs all to support your little indie company and now you give us this this i cant stand by this overkill crimefest was supposed to be about the community and yet youve given us a big middle finger and thrown pay 2 win features in our faces showing us how little you care about the community what with your eeh these suckers will buy anything attitude you overkill you,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,great game ruined because the devs are money s weapon skins that give you better stats csgo syle crates overall its a decent game but the devs have decided to screw over the community they could have at least not added stats to the skins but nope gotta get that money while ruining the game for the playerbase gg guys uninstalling,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a once wonderful game ruined by greed we were promised no microtransactions and we then we got microtransactions,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,edit while the game has been reclaimed by the original developers without extra additions it currently feels as if its a dead horse being beaten with the skin and dlc stick this game is generally good and has a plethora of usercreated mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops but enough of the rose colored filter and lets get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game 1 the community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices youll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than youre new andor learning the game or havent tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host who is apparently some incarnation of a god joining a friend usually solves this problem 2 peer to peer game hosting youll always be at the mercy of someone else if you dont host yourself the game is liable to crashes freezing frequent desync issues and random disconnects 3 the game has an infurating amount of dlc and your performance compared to the players who do have the dlc is almost insulting an example of this being the gage sniper pack make no mistake with this game you will have to pay 4 a worrying trend with overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied and occasionally bundling it up as dlc what was a boatload of hype with the dentist and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in the golden grin casino heist 5 when overkill does make content that affects gameplay it is usually overkill no pun intended on how its balanced creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you dont use said items or skill builds 6 the nature of some of the dlc content has become pay2win for instance the buzzer a melee weapon from the latest golden grin heist using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including special police units this trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties 7 the game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style however youll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively 8 stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer where a misstep on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons however multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer the desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as ai detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client who is usually just moments behind the host what usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of dlc that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,this was the best game ive ever played but why its now garbage the amount of dlcs that have been produced 26 what the f it costs more then the game itself even when it was 50 and the worst part is 5 for a few masks and some mostly terrible weapons that are just for looking cool sure some are good but still 500 ive had this game from the start it was amazing despite all the bugs but now its basically become clash of clans i preordered this game the least they could do is give us the seasons pass or a few free dlcs for trusting their game also 500 for a character seriously now its just 500 for a character soundtrack and skin also the amount of hackers on this game is pathetic seriously they need to stop it also look at payday the heist it has 1 dlc this has 26 dont even get me started on 700 on a map seriously it should be free we paid for the game we should own the whole thing the worst part is that there is other games like terraria that have released sooooo many free updates without any dlc and we get old hoxton and john wick and we get 5 dissapointing maps do not buy this game id urge you to download clash of clans instead of this,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,suck my white,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,tldr with 505 games gone and overkill redeeming themselves wonderfully its time to put down the pitchfork and see where they take this game im hopeful for the future,1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i really loved this game it was my favorite game i supported the gamecompany buying the all the dlcs but then overkill decided that they didnt care about gamers anymore deciding to add microtransactions after repeatedly promising it would never happen now i have zero faith in this game in this company and i doubt i will ever touch it again,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,do you like stealing money and killing cops no good cause this game is mostly about fixing drills and throwing bags,1,0
218620,PAYDAY 2,ive been playing this game since its beta back then the game used to have a lot of potential it was a game i was excited for back in 2013 when payday 2 was finally released it was a broken unpolished piece of software the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found however the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees maskweapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels at this date the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished i would actually recommend the game if it wasnt for overkills behavior these past years of course there are the sheer amount overpriced dlcs and the microtransactions but thats only the tip of the iceberg back in 2014 overkill hosted the first community event known as the crimefest where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time unsurprisingly the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 millions member mark and then overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the alienware alpha and their own vr googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were postponed and released roughly one year later during the second crimefest a couple of month after that event overkill released 2 dlcs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 dlcs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for payday 2 into one single dlc in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase then we got the second community event the hypetrain which is a crimefest where the free rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying dlcs on the store two dlcs were introduced the overkill pack and the completely overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest the first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25 support with 4 masks and a weapon skin crafted with love and care a true payday collectible i suppose overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone but this wasnt enough for overkill all the money they were already making wasnt even close to enough fast foward to the road to crimefest the third community event overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual ingame challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion once again the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward and then overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system la csgo but it is not that bad because csgo and tf2 does the same thing and get away with it right well not really tf2 is a freetoplay where that kind of business model is expected while csgo may be a paytoplay game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge meanwhile payday 2 is not freetoplay has those kind of microtransactions is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid dlcs the microtransactions are there just to again squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself i cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard memeshooter if it wasnt for overkill greed the game is still great but overkill is ruining it since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and dlc sales will never be enough they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,tldr the game is full of advertisements and unkept promises the game was good but not anymore overkill have shown great innovation in how to mess up a great game ive played the game for nearly 1000 hours so im not someone just blindly hating nor do i take any pleasure in giving what used to be my favourite game a negative review they fill it with advertisements essentially turning it into a massive billboard and showing they have no care for the game itself just the money it generates a john wick playable character two hotline miami crosspromotions a illogical heist based around a no name dj with his face plastered throughout it and you are forced to listen to his music the worst part this advertisement costs 7usd an alienware promotion that was 2 masks and 1 melee which was built up for 3 days and the masks are only for people that own an alienware alpha a 500 console a speedrunners crosspromotion requiring you to own speedrunners which took up a day during an event which was supposed to be full of free content a mask to advertise a vr which starbreeze had invested money into a 30 day countdown which ended on payday 2s 1 year anniversary which was filled with references to characters and locations in the games universe to advertise a new game they would be developing a melee weapon from the walking dead they promise a lot of content some which was paid for some which was earned through community accomplishments and some which was supposed to be free yet they dont release any of it and constantly delay it whilst they release a large amount of dlc in between safehouse customisation was supposed to be a feature since the start of the game and was used as part of the games advertisement has still not been released almost 2 years later and shows no sign of it being released they recently claimed they dont even know what it will be an event which required the community to reach certain amount of members before october 2014 in order to unlock content has had much of its content delayed including fbi files which have been delayed until at least 2016 and they have claimed to not know what it will be and a new enemy type which is in the same situation as fbi files the completely overkill pack was a 20 pack which was available for only a month and limited to 50000 copies it contained 4 masks a secret item to be released at a later date and was supposed to be for overkills biggest supporters and they claimed it was not supposed to be a donation at all they even passiveaggressively commented upon those who didnt buy it after the pack was no longer refundable they then announced that the secret item would actually be 25 but purchasers would only be able to obtain 1 out of those 25 items its now 4 months later and overkill have insisted on keeping their biggest supporters in the dark the only information they have given about these 25 items is that it is a part of a larger project and has no eta at all the infamy update which was released in january 2014 was released unfinished they delayed the remainder of it for over a year despite it being the most requested update by the community while releasing sixteen paid dlcs in between the reason for it being delayed for so long is because they wanted to make it as awesome as possible but evidently that was not what happened the update consisted of 8 masks and thats all the golden grin casino heist was promised to be released by the end of 2014 but they delayed it its now being released nearly 7 months later after being palmed off to another company though at least since they sent it off to another company it will have less of a chance of being a bad heist since the casino was announced they have released a large amount of other updates there were supposed to be balancing for the new swat van enemy this was promised 3 months ago and there has been absolutely no indication of there being any changes check the comments to this review for more,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,look son a cancer game,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,crimefest basically microtransactions and those were promised to never to come to pd2 nice lie,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,once upon a time i heartily recommended this game to all my friends and anyone else who would listen overkill have now implemented microtransactions into retail game regardless of how cheap the game gets unless it is free to play this is not okay dont touch this game with a stick until the issue is rectified,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,literally dead overkill have killed the game with microtransactions and lies may the games good times live on and this time die with time and forgetfulness,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,solid game but why they put microtransactions in such a moddable game when they specifically said they wouldnt is beyond me i can mod my gun anyway all they are for is to show off how much better you are than everyone else and pay for stats aka pay to win a poor choice,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,after 24 installments of dlc overkill has finally gotten tired of waiting for their monthly cash installments and has decided to reach for the brass ring taking a page out of valves book users are now free to shell out 250 a pop for brand new drills to open the shiny new skin safes just what payday 2 needed on top of its 100 worth of dlc skin gambling did i forget to mention they actually improve the stats on the weapon hell yeah es,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,crimefest is close free rewards for the community since they finished challenges given by overkill during the last few weeks now crimefest is here the first reward is revealed and it isa treasurechestcrate system with skins ala team fortress 2 and counterstrike global offensive i liked payday 1 i liked payday 2 i might not have alot of hours put into the games but it was a nice game to get back on once in a while and crimefest was the perfect opportunity to get back in now after seeing the first day update of skins that boost stats of the weapons and the gambling mechanic which costs as much as a key in tf2 or csgo i deinstalled and im never going to look back overkill lied to us when they promised free rewards and they lied to us when they said a few years ago pd2 will never have microtransactions its a damn shame what is happening right now,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i used to enjoy payday 2 but now pdgo ing sucks,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,fun game but with crates now team pay offensive 2,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,game used to be fun not anymore pointless grinding and the moneymaking policies of overkill ruined it aside from 200 and more in dlc with overpowered weapons and weapon classes people with the vanilla version have no access to eg rpg any sniper rifle any lmg grenades overkill introduced a crate system similar to csgo dota 2 oder tf2 this was rewarded to the community for completing challenges set by overkill for the annual crimefest payday 2 is nothing but a money grab for the developers they dont care about their players at all unless they critisize overkill in which case they will be banned from the forums and their posts deleted this game is a ripoff similar to infestation survivor stories and the like,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,the game was great but instead of fixing important bugs and fulfilling their promises they decide to pump out more and more dlc for ridiculous prices with two more years of dlc cash grab coming up i no longer have faith in this game yes dlc is optional but the game without dlc is rather limited and not worth its money the insane amount of dlc also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns you get kicked from games because you dont have the right dlc related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless youre willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required dlc this sort of dlc policies ruin the gaming industry and based on all this i simply cant recommend the game and now they added microtransactions in what was supposed to be a period of free updates crimefest this only adds to my earlier frustration and only confirms my earlier message,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,so this is my review after 1856 hours of payday 2 been a fan of the franchise since pdth please keep in mind that im german and english is not my native language weve been let down and were lied to quite a lot by overkill software for the past few years since the release of payday 2 some of the bugs which have existed since release and the absolutely horrible netcode with all the desync have never been looked into despite the fact that they were mentioned and complained about quite a lot within the community forums yes im aware of the fact that desync is basically the way the engine handles lag but its not normal to lag behind for 10 seconds or so while in any regular game youre probably having a ping of 300400 ms connecting to anyone across the world not to mention the issues it will get you into things like getting tazed by tazers which you cant even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to another example would be the hotline miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened guess what same thing with the infamy 20 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics it contains nothing but masks and exp boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of infamy 20 on the forums almir said they were going to look into it once the dust settled and we havent heard anything about it ever since the release of dlcs just kept getting worse were getting new bugs with every dlc which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the molotovs which used to take down the armor of swat turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then it has been abused for cross promotion eg john wick hotline miami speedrunners humble bundle chivalry medieval warfare etc becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each dlc the optimization of the latest dlc map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine we also had a dlc called the completely overkill pack which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released the game of the year edition contains 16 of 27 paid dlcs for payday 2 right now do not get fooled by the fact that they added free dlc releases to the cart they used the payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself as it was revealed afterwards all of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years overkills the walking dead there was a hype train event which basically forced us to buy dlcs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion one of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of 250000 it is still unknown what the tournament is or was who participated and who actually won these 250000 safehouse customization a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game still hasnt made it into the game 2 years after the release of payday 2 for the first crimefest we were promised a new enemy and fbi files which took them an entire year to develope they were released shortly before the second crimefest was announced the new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics the fbi files are basically the same thing that pd2stats used to be the website of pd2stats was shut down thanks to that id like you to take a look at the pd2stats wwwpd2statscom site to read the story about all of this yourself now the latest addition of overkill software at day 1 of the second crimefest which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the payday franchise are microtransactions almir himself as well as david goldfarb said that there would never be any microtransactions in payday 2 in the past proof proof 1 proof 2 proof 3 wwwgamespotcom the community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the crimefest itself they basically added the exact same system that can be found in counterstrikeglobal offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced the safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods masks materials colours and patterns these safes might even contain skins for dlc weapons you do not own a single drill costs 249 right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most dlcs if they are not on sale 499 and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75 124 all of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game as well as forum mods censoring deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for they even openly admit that theyre actively censoring the forums proof personally i dont feel like a game which costs about 20 and comes with additional dlc worth about 110 should be using any microtransaction system at all the dlcs are more than enough as it is yes ive bought almost all of the dlcs for the full price including the completely overkill pack except for the last 2 or so they disabled the lua hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second crimefest too whether or not its related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins give us an ability to create skins like goonmod is up to you and your conspiracy theories my very own modoverride skins for the black and skull dozer are still working however,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,time for a serious review after all the 3k playtime hours jokes last updated 171115 cons after crimefest 2015 overkill has added microtransactions into the game and completely ruined the playerbase with crates skins and a bunch of other crap the game is now completely pay2win and none of the free fun is in it and paid skins actually give you an advantage yay not to mention 2 years ago they promised to never ever add microtransactions and then hoped people would forget a few years later and back stab them shame on you overkill short repetitive maps with small objectives most maps are just drilling getting cash and going to the escape zone only a few maps are low with lots of objectives and loud action such as hotline miami but those arent a lot of maps most maps are just small with not many verities most missions require you to camp at a small place and fight through waves of cops compared to payday the heist where everything is open with lots of objectives and places to look through a 2 years old game that hasnt been optimized since the release the players have to trust and struggle with mods in order to get a playable fps in game and of course the latest maps they released received a crap ton of complains about low fps because the maps are so huge and their game is so poorly optimized the textures are so rubbish that modders have to make hd mods so you could enjoy something rather than 1024 textures of your character model or npcs dropped weapons etc sometimes i stand in a corner and see pixels on the floor trying to look like a pepsi can and other trash ai is literally useless in this game all they do is follow you and help you up nothing else absolutely nothing so multiplayer coop is the main focus of this game offline isnt as enjoyable as online apparently dlc releases are more important than bug fixes the game has a sh it ton of bugs that havent been fixed since the release if you want to actually enjoy the game and advance most your weapons to be death wish compatible you will need to purchase a few of the dlcs or else its nearly impossible for a beginner if you dont pay you are simply underpowered thank god theres no pvp although its nice that paying for dlc isnt a must to play a certain map seriously rpg nade launchers and flame throwers are great a community based off most players farming their infamy ranks on sr or hb and considering themselves pros and kicking everyone under the level infamy 5 from their lobbies and considering themselves as godlike heisters no one actually cares about the heist plan your role or the in game objectives all they care is that medic or ammo bag you bring to the heist to supply them over 2 years old free promised content hasnt been released until this very day most lobbies are too mainstream that its simply hard to find something different these days like a loud bank heist or a heli escape on big bank you get the point developers listen to the community yet they are too bi tchy to invest in a workshop or a proper freaking in game anticheat infamy ranks are not as satisfying as you might think theyre actually easy to grind and a sh it that isnt rewarding pros cheap dlcs recently also got a price drop monthly updates dlc fun not a lot but enough free content from time to time to keep the helmets flying mod support but they wont bother investing a workshop so we stop paying for sites to save mods 4 and maybe more years of in game content support 2 more years of dlc and free content a somewhat okay plot in the background of the payday gang and hoxtons betrayal wide variety of weapons masks modifications and so on a somewhat balanced skills and perks system yet still buggy at some points i wrote a lot larger review than this but steam didnt let me post this because i wrote too much anyways i will clearly keep playing this game i dont dislike it but i experienced and saw way too much in game to know that this game isnt something a new player would enjoy i would personally uninstall and ask for a refund if i tried to join lobbies 10 times in a row and some infamy trashy decides to kick me instead of giving me tips or helping me out also this is not a dlc complain post i own them all and will probably own future ones as well no flame no hate i love almir and the other developers but you cant force the whole community to behave and stop being as co cky as hoxton is to houston edit yes know my english is absolute mint,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a fun game killed by moneygrabbing overshills many issues still arent fixed but theyre pumping dlcs out just look at the dlc list its ridiculous,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,just dont play microtransactions,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,the developers milk the game like a cow now in the update celebrating the anniversary of the game the developers added game skins so the game can become another uncrating simulator like tf2 which is free mind you and csgo which doesnt have 28 dlcs that you have to pay for i wouldnt mind it as much if the skins were just cosmetic but they arent thats right skins give you an actual advantage since they boost stats also some of the skins are just for dlc weapons which will most likely lead to situations like this overkill oh you just spent a ton of money on keys or as they call it drills and actually managed to unlock a cool skin for the rpg nice now would you like to use that skin whats that you dont have the dlc for it welp better go spent another few bucks since the skin is useless until you do the things that the developers were supposed to add during the anniversary celebration were promised to be free instead we got this they tried to make us feel better afterwards by adding cool things such as heists from the first game masks a ton of them and a jumping animation which to me serves the same purpose as applying lube after getting rammed from behind i really worry about the future of this game or the gaming industry in general if other companies will follow overkills example,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a game all about multimillionaire criminal masterminds who continuously fail to replace their malfunctioning drill,1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,this is how this industry will rot selling effin weapon skins,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i loved this game it was the absolute best of the best playing with friends completeing awesome heists but now im sad because this game is a former shadow of what it once was overkill was a company that listened to its players and changes things acording to there opinions they released free weapons and heists from time to time and that is amazing i loved the developers and supported them every step of the way but i guess thats all goin out the god damned window because overkill put microtransactions in the game woopdidoo i guess ill just go find another game to put 500 ing hours into you almir you destroyed what i love,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i used to love this game and i would play it almost every day however with the recent update adding skins with stat boosts that can only be obtained through microtransactions i cannot recommend this game to anyone the game was already leaning towards pay2win with all the dlc that added weapons that were superior to the vanilla weapons but the game was still amazing and fun without any dlc sadly overkill has given up and they arent even trying to hide the fact that the game is pay2win anymore so its up to you of you want to buy this game but i would not recommend it what used to be fun has now become a mess of microtransactions,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,you must buy the gage review pack 01 to read this review,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,new update dont buy it unless youre a csgo kid 010 edit we got brand new nice joke right there collaboration of owners of goat simulator amp overkill and new heist about stealing goats great,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,wow great just what i always wanted now i can pay to have my guns be at the stats that they used to be at for free,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i cant recommend this game despite the amount of hours ive put into it i simply cant recommend a game thats slowly deteriorated to the point that its more of a chore than a joy to play when i first got my paws on this game it was back when there were only a couple of dlc packs where infamy wasnt a thing to prove your worth and where players were actually more creative and dared to try new ways of completing heists rather than just repeating the structured meta that they believe they must abide by at all costs now overkill promise us 2 more years of supporting the game which in their language means to churn out more dlc weapon packs instead of new and inventive missions not that it makes the slightest of difference in the rare times that they do add extra content as lobbies only ever consist of the same mission repeated over and over that gains them high exp cases in point hoxton breakout and shadow raid so i start with my first major issue the community is mostly full of pretentious s with a minor amount of exceptions high infamy players think theyre the if theyre not trying to order around the lowernone infamy players theyre kicking them from matches instantly practically defeating the whole objective of helping them to learn how to play bare in mind infamy means nothing in this game at least not how it used to when infamy only hit 5 it doesnt prove how much experience you have at the game it doesnt make you any stronger or makes you any wiser its just simply for those who are bored of sticking to level 100 and want to repeat it all over again to collect infamous masks and recieve exp faster whats more ironic is that most of these high and mighty players have only gained their ranks through repeating the same mission over and over until theyre given exp penalties andor their brains turn to mush which would explain a lot about their attitude either way they have no room to mock others for learning missions when theyre only accustomed to one or two missions themselves and i wouldnt make an issue out of this and call it a con to the game if it didnt happen as often as it does but you will experience this a lot if youre new just try to stick to players around your level if you want to avoid being patronised so unless youve got a handful of friends to play this with most of your playtime here will be spent browsing for servers via crimenet trying to find something other than the tedious hoxton breakout mission only to join a server and either get kicked for some bizarre reason or lose connection to the host furthermore the game just seems to have lost of lot of its initial sense of cooperating as a team if only for helping to take down enemies in the waves of loud missions nobody really needs to work together with players anymore nobody is really assigned to a specific role nobody really cares what your priorities ingame are just so long as you bring them some extra ammo and health kits it can literally be a one man job if the player has a good idea on what hes doing especially when it comes to completing missions in stealth which are usually better off alone due to desync issues and ridiculous random glitches that often occur in the times that you do actually get into a full party match with random players nobody ever wants to think outside of the box everybody has a strict and structured way of playing each and every map despite the fact that the game implements a random number generator system to change your experience each time you play a heist heck if you dare to open the door to stairs in hoxton breakout prepare to be called a noob for not using it on a shutter door or the damn armory or if you want to just play bank heist in loud for once the public wont be happy and normally quit immediately this is down to the community and the game itself heists arent as free and open as theyd fool you into believing sure you can choose to play most missions loud or stealth but once you make the decision between the two then you stick to the same objectives nothing ever truly random happens such as random last minute objectives or a change in plan the closest thing you get to that is the preplanning stage before a heist in which you choose your escape plan and place a few packs of ammo to make your life easier if youre lucky your pickup helicopter might land on the other side of the map whoopie they even allow you to draw in the preplanning stage which is just completely pointless as nobody ever really plans their heists out most stealth heists just end up in a game of trial and error so the remaining issues i have with the game its been out long enough yet the devs just havent really given players enough options to optimise their game to their liking not a major issue but still a pain that players have to use user made mods if they want to improve their performance none of the missions are long enough andor are just repetitive and tedious most loud missions are just placing a drill and surviving waves of enemies until the drill is complete and then throwing bags of money around stealth missions are pretty much the same minus waiting around for drill but instead having to avoid the line of sight of guards that somehow have the ability to walk through walls when the game decides to have a glitchy moment the card drop feature in order to gain masks and weapon attachments is just another reason the game is more of a chore its also the perfect excuse for overkill to sell you their mod pack dlc or other weapon dlc to speed up the process of finding those much needed attachments for your weapons youre literally paying for achievements with some of the dlc yes despite the fact that youve paid 399 for a pack you will be unable to use all of its content until youve completed the required achievements unless youre buying dlc most of the free weapons are underpowered in comparison further forcing you to buy the dlc if you want the most from this game and to be on par with the other dlc paying players hell anything that overkill do give you for free is still underpowered or weak in content compared to the dlc it would seem dlc is a priority over fixing game issues and errors i mean sure they eventually get around to fixing those issues along with the release of another dlc pack so in conclusion i guess you might consider it unfair to judge a game mainly by its community but its thanks to the game itself that the community is set out how it is the game relies on a good community but fails to support it the game is currently in a state leaving the players with nothing more to do than grind for exp or test out new dlc weapon packs and its the repetitive and tedious missions that leave you with these only options and i mean repetitive theres literally 4 missions of the same bank heist which is just the same mission with different items to throw in bags yet these are considered unique from each other in the beginning the game really felt like something new and different new ideas promised which have since been put on hold and the players actually seemed to play for the fun rather than the rank beside their username now it just feels like the developers dont know where else to take the game they wont give us a steam workshop yet will release new weapon packs often they leave it to modders to create unstable lua mod to help improve their game experience and fix issues the devs are fully aware of rather than fix these issues themselves so up to this point until they decide to actually improve the game quit with the dlc priority and help the players have a better experience i simply cant recommend it so heres to 2 more years of nothing but weapon pack dlc and a whole lotta unfixed bugs,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a great game to play with three friends however there is wayyyyy too much paid dlc now,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,a review in the form of a heartfelt open letter to overkill dear overkill software you dont know me nor do you care to know me but you know my money and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value i bought your game back when it was in beta testing you know when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 13rd of the game and that preorders would get all future content for free i cringed when you lied about us only playing 13rd of the game in beta all you did was unlock our levels to level past 30 and gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less i moaned when you started releasing dlc heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us i even btched when you only gave us preorder alpha and beta players a single 5 dlc for our investment into the games future but the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing it was everything your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends of which there where a sizable few to not touch your game in years the last heist i did willingly for fun was shadow raid for point of fact back when it was freshly released not even a week old a friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your dlcs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current we did the hoxton break out as it was new and again i noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more and pay you more money as it was i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope none of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time that is only one example of how youd turned this game into dlc quest and what of your lies that pile upon this we where promised things to do with our off shore money and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization nothing ever came in the time i played nothing of reason or value and as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game but i could be wrong the point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even at release in the case of safe house customization but they where blatant lies designed to get our money i may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this but the message will be clear regardless after spending nearly 100 in this game i still dont have all of the dlcs nor do i want them at the rate youre going youre not getting a penny more from me nor my friends who use to enjoy this game and that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory even competing with skyrim and trumping overwatch for the shear fun but if i have to keep paying for your dlcs to stay in current content if i have to do asinine borderline moronic achievements for critical items if i have to be force fed lie after lie i do not want to play your game nor will i play the next when payday 3 comes out there had best not be any dlc for the first 6 months you owe us that much the first 6 months should be free content as youd promised us wed get this time but lied to us about i and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any dlc in the first 6 months money talks you built a game a bout stealing it and in the process stole mine its time to put your theft where it should be in the game not in reality yours truly a very disappointed and spurned fan ps even having spent at or arround 120 on this game and owning over half the dlcs it would still take another 90 to buy all the current dlc i dont own buyer beware they will nickle and dime you to death pps id like to iterate that payed dlc is not a bad thing its the content and quality vs price margien im upset with a well as frequency of paid vs free dlc the main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many dlc id likely have bought more dlc and played longer as a genuine truth had all missions been free and guins been the only dlc id likely have been able to pick and choose what i want or need in the case of meta weapons easier or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed dlc id likely have been less happy with that than any other option but its still preferred to what youre doing now editupdate after reviewing my account histroy i have revised the numbers on costs all financial cost is now factual and nolonger rough approximations based on memory,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,ive played this game for 734 hours of my life and i can say without a shadow of a doubt it was a fantastic game brimming with potential at some point now its turned to because of incompetent developers who cant listen to the community and just try to peddle their stupid micro transactions amp dlc rather than actually improving the game do yourself a favor and dont buy this,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,when payday 2 was released it was so much fun to play there was no other game like it and had a really good developement team who would update it a lot and for free and this now annoys me to rate it negative because i used to play this game a lot and enjoy every second of it but after about 6 months the game just kept getting worse and worse as the developers started trying to milk money from this game by adding tons of pointless dlc which barely contain anything and are priced at 399 each which is a lot considering that you basically get 4 masks 4 new melee weapons which are basically pointless a few paintjobs and a new gun the game is also extremely repetitive after a while most of the maps are pretty small if they are nondlc and have a boring set up as they basically just move a keycard or close a door whenever you play it again there are a lot of weapons in this game which is really good as there is a huge variety and a good weapon modding system but this gets quite annoying as the mod you want for a gun is so hard to get as you can only get one drop from a heist and most of the time its just an annoying paint for a mask which you dont want the last time i played this game a lot of hackers were in it and they just ruined the game because they were either there to troll you and ruin your stealth or spam the map with loads of money bags which just crash your game another annoying thing is when your trying to stealth and some troll joins your game throws a grenade or shoots and alerts you and leaves straight away i know you can avoid this by having private heists but most of the time your going to want to play with other people as its easier and more fun so i would have recommended this game at the release but because of the devs being greedy and the community being annoying i cant recommend it,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,overkill are untrustworthy several representatives of overkill claimed that payday 2 would not include microtransactions one such represenative said that it would never happen and yet they implemented microtransactions as part of the free crimefest ii update moral of story never buy overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless furthermore independent sources claim that overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update even mods approved by overkill such as hoxhud by supposedly removing the lua hook required to make mods work if true such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time finally that overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a reward for completing community challenges in the road to crime fest event shows complete and utter contempt for the payday 2 community keeping in mind that the road to crime fest event is all about celebrating the anniversary of payday the heist which is ironically microtransaction free clearly overkill have grown fat on the profits of their hit dlc train known as payday 2 i say that because every employee at overkill must be on acid for them to collectively conclude that this was the right way and right time to implement something that theyd previously stated theyd never do yes microtransactions and the removal of modding capability is exactly what this game needed clearly sources httpforumssteampoweredcomforumsshowpostphpp34451580amppostcount1 httpwwwgamespotcomarticlespayday2wonthavemicrotransactions11006410303,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,good game but dlc nightmare ruins it,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,ive put in well over a thousand hours into this game at this point but a lot of those hours were ruined by hackers that overkill has still done nothing about the dlc power creep is enormous at this point and now theyve introduced microtransactions despite promising they would never do it im sick of putting up with so much lazy garbage for a game that should be way more enjoyable,-1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,i tried overkill i really did you didnt fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new dlc and new enemies that were unfair without dlc and i tried to ignore it i loved this game i really did and i played it to virtually no end even at one point abandoning team fortress 2 for it weapon packs that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in with nothing useful to add just one gimmick weapon to grab peoples attention in the hopes that theyd buy the wacky item and i tried to ignore it i got over the fact you never bothered programming cloakers properly and that theyre happy to kick you from the ground floor on rats whilst youre on the roof if they cant think of a way to path to you desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial patch that vaguely improved it whilst dropin joining even though a community mod pocohud addresses the issue perfectly well and i got over it refusal to add limb hitboxes because theyd be too much unnecessary work when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it but i still got over it your treatment of loyal fans on twitter eg the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of if i loved a game id buy it on pc as though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment i resented but i played on regardless the hype train a paytoenter version of a previous free event that provided us with an advertisement for a future payfor dlc and an enemy thats virtually immortal without dlc that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way i tried and tried to ignore but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin when you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented two years ago and didnt start development for until the beginning of 2015 and instead just made it a hyperpowerful version of an already existing enemy that of course is weak as a kitten if you use dlconly explosives that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself i was disgusted the fbi files a longawaited addition to the game turned out to be a link to overkills own website that plays a cute little virtual machine that shows you gun statistics something theres already a wiki for as well as the characters profiles and backgrounds something you could already see on crimenet in game and i took a break and figured id get over it eventually id come back id play again i played this game to the point where i could beat death wish solo on loud heists so surely id pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms right and then overkill lost it the game now has csgos uncrating system they clearly noticed gun mettle was a huge success in team fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing small problem with this theory however team fortress 2 already had an item system and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be payday had nothing of this sort so this comes across as a blatant cashin on an idea that worked for another game but thats fine even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the i or the inspect animations in this instance it worked for csgo it wasnt as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in tf2 maybe itll work for overkill despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons and if that were it id say i really hate this company but whatever and resign myself to just playing but no thats not all the weapon skins give statistical advantages these give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins and theres no other way to get them save for opening them with a key drill straight from the community marketplace you have to spend money real money not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation but actual currency on your steam account to get these weapons and by not shelling out extra money that already costs or so ive been informed not a us resident around 25 you are at a disadvantage to other players who will do so because overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update tf2 did for free which was successful because of the rebalancings congrats overkill i know im not the only person youll have heard this from but youre true filth and i took great pleasure in uninstalling dont buy this game all youll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an everexpanding list of dlc and now apparently some pretty gun skins or else the game is insultingly difficult on death wish all other difficulties are easy regardless because why would overkill the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it pose a challenge and stealth is always easy just for what it is the game is disgusting and never content with the amount of cash its sucked in and broken beyond repair but dont expect it to be fixed thatll cost you extra brief update significantly late the microtransactions have been mostly retracted whether thats enough to make amends isnt for me to decide feel free to decide for yourself,-1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,my 8 year old son broke away from minecraft today he sat on my lap while we made a rocket he asked questions about rockets we made it into space and he asked are we in space we came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow his eyes were wide open as we slowed down we pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed we crashed and he asked if the kerbal was ok i said yes as i hit esc and went back to the vab and changed a few things a few minutes later we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face i havent heard a word about minecraft since thank you for making this wonderful game,1,0
220200,Kerbal Space Program,words alone cannot express how amazing ksp is to be honest this is not a game for everyone if you are in the market for some fastpaced space combat sim with all kinds of weapons and big explosions then this isnt what you are looking for except for the big explosions ksp has you covered there however if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut this is definitely for you if you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the apollo moon landings this is definitely for you if precise measured flying careful planning and deltav budgeting are what drives you this is definitely for you if you want to learn about orbital mechanics and are dying to know what the oberth effect or a hofman transfer orbit are this is definitely for you if you like physics this is definitely for you optionally if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot one part then this is also definitely for you kerbal space program is challenging fun frustrating mind boggling huge hilarious complicated deep and just plain awesome,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game should be standard issue in school physic classes taught me more about orbital mechanics than anything else,1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,there are no other games really like this you will in a terribly entertaining way learn some fundamental of orbital mechanics rocket science aerodynamics astrophysics and even a bit of mechanical engineering and straight physics there is nobody to shoot no zombies no monsters no combat no grand conquests and raising flags over captured enemy bases yet you have never and will never play a game that will challenge entertain and reward you like ksp will the learning curve is stiff but not terrible you play it at your own pace because well there is no other pace you can play it at games like dark souls are hard because youve got to have the right mix of luck and muscle memory and you have to throw yourself at it again again ksp can be hard because calculating the right setup for the right injection burn to put you in a viable position to get past ike into a stable orbit around duna with enough fuel to get you home is a staggering undertaking a lot of planning and forethough this is one of those games that changes gaming you will kick yourself repeatedly when you look back and realize you didnt have a chance to play ksp it is a complex indepth engaging well balanced and changing but simplified to make it fun to play simulator for building and deploying rockets and ships to go into space visit and explore other worlds and travel a solar system the developer is a big part of this success one of the first trail blazers on early access they have been amazing for involving the community several of the top modders for ksp they love and support modding in ksp not to fix bugs but add content were engaged and used in building content for the 10 release even they are still engaged in improving and adding content to ksp ive got close to 800 hours in at this point and still havent really played swaths of the game there are dozens of mods i want to try but havent had the chance this is the kind of game thats fun and engaging for years and years sometimes you need to step outside the regular run of the mill and see why a game like this has tens of thousands of reviews that are almost universally positive,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,pros can run on most potatos is not one of those boring simulators graphical and part mods are amazing no degree in astrophysics is needed you can make rovers planes rockets shuttles boats ect total freedom to walk around and explore the solar system things to do on other planets collect science make bases drill for ore 3 different modes sandbox career or science fantastic community cons no multiplayer yet its coming no stockvanilla clouds or dynamics on any planets yet there are plenty of mods though fully mastering the game takes a good deal of time not entertaining for 10yearold cod players the addiction may cause sudden loss of girlfriends or career overall score 1110 would fail docking sequence on endurance again,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,if you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives then this may be the game for you failure is the only option most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planettoplanet maneuver or how you really nailed that hohmann transfer no itll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived but somehow did my game once glitched as a kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface he bounced and not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way he bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrongthe only type of mission that truly exists he fell from space and lived forget space erect a statue my first manned mission to the mun ended in predictable failure i tried landing without any sort of landing gear how you might ask by landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff i forgot about my horizontal velocity however and ended up ripping the engine apart i had all the fuel i needed for a return mission but the broken engine was left kilometers away oops at least i could plant a cool flag i attempted a rescue mission because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do stranded person in space send more people to help them the first mission collided with the mun at 600 ms rough landing the second mission landed but i was probably 50km awaywhich isnt all that bad all things considered i had the stranded kerbal run toward the landed ship but it was taking forever so i started using his little jetpack to expedite things lemons and lemonade as it turns out you can actually disintegrate a kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid like the surface of the mun you will forever be in our thoughts mac kerman so much for the rescue i may as well have the rescue team return safely remember that landing gear part yeah i still hadnt updated that section of the ship instead i landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp bulletproof logic at least this kerbal had the dignity of a fiery fiery death an honorable death by my own hands in ksp your little kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous lost column it was with great sorrow that i saw mac kermans name in there i didnt care so much about the other guys who cares about the second guy on the mun but heres the thing several years into my career mode mac magically reappeared and was ready for action he came back from the dead and what was the first thing he wanted to do go back into space to die again in conclusion yes to this game just yes i currently have a kerbal orbiting the second moon minmus yes he is in a stable orbit without a ship just him and hes been there for close to 30 years now ill get around to that at some point update still in orbit,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,1010 ruined science fiction movies with now learnt knowledge of reallife astrophysics,1,0
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i score this simulation game 1210 just hit the buy button it exceeds all expectations the game isnt finished yet but i dont care they cant fail anything anymore just buy it or wait for a sale and then buy it whenever you buy it you wont feel ripped off i guarantee you that kerbal space program is pure magic on the facade it comes across as something with the depth of angry birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled however there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions theres a reason im scoring this game 12 out of 10 i find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library i even try not to play it but when i do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores ksp like the name might have hinted is a space program simulator game there is the career mode involving missions and research and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it the game is in early access and the career needs work i find the missions redundant and confusing but its already fun and this review is more about the sandbox mode you run the show so you set out your own missions like fly to the moon or another planet then you have to build your lander rover satelite or whatever the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space you also need to learn to make an orbit then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around there are no concessions by the time youve figured out how to get where you want to go you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight you dont need a science degree to do this and to understand this the game is brilliant this way you can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too i recommend this game to all people that like simulation games tycoon games lego the plastic bricks science fiction in general science in general rockets and blowing stuff up real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn as you set out your own missions you send your kerbal individuals they all have names on grand adventures their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons the bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse really a fun and beautifull feature in the kerbol name of the star system you will also find the planets moho eve with its moon gilly kerbin with mun and minmus duna with ike then a gasgiant called jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet eelo the distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space it may be a scaled down planetary system but that doesnt mean its small i have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world each planet and moon comes with its own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and youll busy for hundreds of hours before youve done it all everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother you know what the other player is talking about when i started playing i had little expectations it looked like a mod but then i reached space it was like the opening of the movie 2001 a space oddisey the space whales ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin ever going higher and higher kerbin getting smaller and smaller i passed the mun lost kerbin then found the eva button i found out stands for extra vehicular activity or go play outside so i lost my kerbal hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called ksp while drooling over my keyboard this game is not done yet im not sure when they aim for a release candidate but they cant fail this anymore nasa has made an addon for it so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new spacex rocket how awesome is that and the developer has even announced multiplayer i dont know how this will work and what we could do in an online game and its already more fun if a friend plays this game too but its anticipated by me nonetheless the educational value of this game is through the roof i thought i understood the principle of orbits but boy did i learn a lot i understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically but putting it to practice requires more then just going so i watched nasa do it they pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed so ok i built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few tryouts and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with at this point the concept that isaac newton put down of every action has a pose and equal reaction gets a whole new meaning in orbit youll see ksmiley every run you make in kerbal you get more advanced your rockets become more stable because you know how to make them you get to other planets faster because you know how to get there my rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander of which i built a new version every night to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck i landed on duna which took me 2 weeks to build it went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mindboggling engineering puzzle that even my pc or the games engine found hard to process when launched there comes a point where you get stuck on something like how to dock in space there are several things to do but i warn you this can make or break your experience try as hard as you can if youre stuck play with a friend you know together on one pc thinking and building and if all else fails then try youtube or a guide letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience but when youve reached this point it just means a whole new world of kerbal opens before your eyes i think every ksp player has posted screenshots videos guides both online and private to friends the ammount of material you can dig up is staggering also dont install mods as you just start playing exept for scansat perhaps but dont the other mods will lure you mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy ive reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and i had seen all the parts ingame ive reached the point of not getting my ships docked this was the point where i looked on youtube read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods mods like mechjeb in flight telemetry and autopilot options use at your own risk advanced cockpits cockpit screens buttons to press external cameras awesome more parts graphical addons scansat scans planets awesome etc but with all games in early access mods can be broken when the game is patched but when youve reached that point ksp can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities as realistic as you want it to be this game is 100 quality dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get when its done it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game with more standard parts more physics more career more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now from that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and i dont think this game will die out soon just buy the game youll have fun for years to come i promiss now years after release i stand by my review this game will stand its ground if its not on sale check out steamhookupscom if theres a good deal in it for you,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,day 1 this game looks pretty good ill get it day 2 this is hard to learn but ill stick to it day 10 so thats how you land day 50 these spaceplanes are hard to build day 200 yes my 11 scale model of the death star is done day 500 havent seen the sun in weeks so hungry day jeb is love jeb is life,1,0
220200,Kerbal Space Program,started playing this game when i was 11 it was too complicated for me id spent over 20 hours trying to reach the moon but always failed im now 14 and ive finally reached the moon and back 1010 would wait 3 years until im mature enough to understand a game again edit for those saying the game came out last year the first public release of this game was on june 24 2011 its official release out of beta was last year 2015,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i played this game with my son now he wants to be an austronaunt 1010 seriously once upon a time if my son would have asked me dad how did people land on the moon i wouldnt know what to tell him but today when my son asked me that question awww yis i simply said ill show you how and we fired up the game i was able with the help of ksp to show my son the beauty of trial and error the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is and how small we are i let him built it himself parachutes on a moon lander backwards engines and everything i remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded the look of awe as we made orbit his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon i remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes which didnt work we crashed hard after the inital shock was over my son asked in surprise dad why dont parachutes work on the moon oh man thank you ksp thank you for making science fun,1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,when you play kerbal space program you find yourself becoming one of two types of individuals either you throw everything together and make things up as you go or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it either way mission success whatever you define that to be is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky pun intended its very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your kerbals the characters that man spacecraft has walked on the surface of another celestial body its also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when youve made it halfway across the kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home this game will frustrate and exhilarate you well worth the purchase,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,its been quite a ride four long years of development cool stuff accidentally education and the kraken and here we are one point oh point whatever and oh are things different but thats all the past lets talk about the present this is a game in which you go to space repeatedly success optional most of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination you can just throw some bits together hit the go button and see what happens whats that there are kerbals in there im sorry i couldnt hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device conversely you can put things together in a very particular manner and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle its all up to you your sandbox is the solar system go play due to the nature of things and such this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment yet its just as fun alone at home now for the less sandboxoriented among us or just the people like me who enjoy progression theres a career mode this time you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range manned ballistic missiles for science seriously you generate science from everything and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more science be careful though dont want to blow up too many bits because you have funding to worry about now you should also take care of your kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable also the camera shakes theres complicated aerodynamics theres thermodynamics theres moresodynamics theres orbital mechanics theres resource mining which you can make fuel with theres management theres pretty explosions theres good sound effects that are also deafening theres accidentally education and so much more for only some money however the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating ignore it fumble around for a while and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era theres not really much else to talk about all the other details are either not noteworthy neutral or better kept quiet so go build some intercon advanced spacecraft,1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,got to the moon with 2 kerbals half way back to kerbin i realized i left bill on the mun 1010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,nothing will prepare you for the moment you first touch down on the mun with your kerbals alive the sense of accomplishment is magnificent its probably comparable to the crushing defeat you feel as you realize you forgot to make sure you had enough fuel to get back home but youve done it you managed to get your kerbals to the mun land them safely lift off and get into an aerobrake orbit around kerbin aaaand you forgot to put parachutes on your command pod,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game is like a toast,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,sent a mission to the mun landed got science started taking off looked at fuel empty got my kerbal out of the ship forced him to throw himself at the ship repeatedly made it back home 1110 would throw kerbals at ship to deorbit again,1,0
220200,Kerbal Space Program,old info at top keep reading probably one of the best games i have ever played i have logged well over 1000 hours on this game and i still enjoy logging into it frequently try it out and get some mods you need to accept a bit of instabuility at times with lots of mods im using like 13 mods right now but if you go vanilla witch still allowes for lots of unique ideas on its own stabuility is rarely an issue game takes a hog of a pc and due to 32 bit engine sigh is stuck using only 1 core of your processor but is usually sparkling on a good pc none the less and for advanced players theres really no end to what you can doa person need only look at youtube and they can get an idea of the insanity that is building your own rockets in a physics engine you plan it all and if you mess up fuel levels mistakes ect another kerbal bites the dust now serving 15 a pa announces april 2015 2000 hours and climbing still have not run out of uniqe things to do theres always a crazier mission than you considered before the mods have only gotten better and with some tricks like running in opengl mode you can load this game up with alot of mods before it explodes you can install real solar system mod and play on a real life sized system makes going to the moon and back something worth bragging about thats for extremely advanced players as even i find it hard feb 2016 3000 hours game completed runs great on 64 bit version now mods arent an issue and you can load it up until the cows come home so much more stable than ever faster than ever and every thing just works better now as the last thing they did was optimize the crap out of it still one of the best games i have ever owned play it constantly,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ruined my ability to enjoy science fiction movies,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this is legitimately one of the best video games ever created people can learn about real life science and have lots of fun to go with it and you can blow up space frogs,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,not as boring as a simulator not too cartoony to loose immersion just perfect 1010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,after my son had a really bad day where nothing seemed to go right we had a talk about how failing is part of learning i said remember how you watched me flying rockets on the computer he said yeah they kept going all over the place and smashing into the ground have you landed on the moon yet nope crashed into it a couple times learning new things every time though can i play that game too kerbal space program lessons for life,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i have been playing this game for a very long time very easy to get into very hard to master it is not a simulation by any means but that doesnt mean you wont still learn a lot about rocketry and the things which nasa and the folks who fly in those crazy contraptions have to deal with the community as well is extremely nice and extremely active with a mass amount of mods for the game which allows you to really customize it to your liking much like elder scrolls games are on top of that they are also moving it to unity 5 if they havnt already at the time youre reading this in the future meaning the limitation on mods will be quite literally limitless that with multiplayer to boot coming soon as well with unity 5 the game itself has 3 modes career which pits you against your mind balancing income from successfull missions reputation and science failed missions could cost you big and learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles use science to unlock new parts on the tech tree to push your exploration even farther science same as career but without the reputation and money sandbox like all sandboxes everything is tehre from the start no money science or anything else just build and have fun what you do in the game is open ended its your choice build what you want and fly it anywhere you want or anywhere it can go there are many many entire different planets to explore moons asteroids etc a fully open ended solar system taking off from kerbin flying through the upper atmosphere and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding from there going to another planet landing anywhere you want on it and exploring it then coming back and hoping you have the right trajectory to burn safely through the kerbin atmosphere as flames fly up around your ship epic 5 tests launching rockets that failed 2000000 launched a rocket to the mun but couldnt return 400000 1 stranded kerbal attempted a rescue mission with the same result 450000 another stranded kerbal finally reaching the mun and returning back safely in the water priceless,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,builds rocket that can leave launchpad forgets parachute builds rocket that can leave atmosphere forgets heatshield builds rocket that can go to the mun forgets landing legs builds rocket without forgetting anything forgets real life remembers parachute,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,truly epic one of those games i keep going back to 300 hours as i write this being a simulation the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless my most recent kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe joolstar1 was about to arrive at jool after nearly 4 years in flight actually it happened quite a while before that i just wasnt aware of it i switched to the probe ready to finetune my approach so i could cut through the atmosphere bleeding off speed without wasting fuel something was wrong the probe didnt respond to inputs thats when i realised i hadnt deployed the solar panels before leaving kerbin orbit cursing i tried to deploy them nothing i mashed the button repeatedly still nothing i checked the batteries empty since i didnt have a kerbal on board to do an eva there was nothing i could do except watch helplessly as joolstar1 sailed straight past its destination a failure destined to orbit the sun forever this game is all about failing repeatedly and hilariously until a darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build fly and land rockets i cant recommend it highly enough,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,2 things 1 the best game i have ever played 2 scott manley i could write a 10k word essay on all the good things about this game but ill stick to pointing out the one thing that was both what got me hooked and would also frustrate me to the point of almost not wanting to play the learning curve its the single most challenging learning experience ive had since i left uni but i loved every second of it the absolute highlight of this game for me when a friend and i shared a save file and flew a mission over 2000tons of spaceship to the planet jool with the aim of landing and every moon and then coming home we worked on the designs together assembled our ship in orbit together and ran the mission kerbal has given me the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life and i play a lot of games,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,while its not exactly beginnerfriendly kerbal space program ksp is a brilliant game for what it achieves what other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel gravity is a difficult beast to tame youre drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically once youre on the launchpad though gets real you will fail a lot with your rocket exploding or tipping over or messing up the sequence of stages just leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge and that is still the early game sending probes and landers to other planets and moons building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system these are all possible beyond that the career and science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments and further still the sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals unless youre a genius or have a huge deal of patience you will need to refer to various tutorials wikis guides and discussions online if physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks youll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game ksp will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time any person whos dreamed of working at nasa must try kerbal space program recommended,1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,its not exactly rocket science is itoh wait yes it is kerbal space program is a game about building spacecraft and unless youre very good at the game watching them blow up which is currently in early access in ksp you design and build your very own spacecraftrockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal with a vast array of parts at your disposable its daunting at first well its daunting for a while but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering ksp has four different game modes each of which i will give a brief description of first off theres sandbox mode in sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works next we have scientific mode in scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places eg the surface of kerbin or low kerbin orbit science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments you begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress up next is career mode career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about money is earned by completing contracts such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are however reputation can be lost through either failing contracts or losing kerbals last and probably least depending on what you like are the games premade scenarios ranging from tutorials on docking to the nasa redirect mission this game mode is what you would expect it to be just different scenarios to try out not much to say about this one graphics are pretty nice lots of different parts the building menus are good and building is relatively easy by easy i mean straightforward to use not easy to make decent vehicles a number of different planets and moons each with different appearances and properties good controls and useful hotkeys good staging setup endless possibilities of what you can make from simple little rockets to huge spacestations in orbit around distant planets reasonaly good physics but not perfect ill get to that later plentiful explosions huge replayability great modding community and adding mods is extremely easy kerbals are nice little race and you can get attached to the more well known kerbals quite easily i lt3 jeb very basic tutorials this game really throws you in at the deep end immensely steep learning curve im 60 hours in and ive only recently made it to the mun and successfully landed the physics and controls for spaceplanes are pretty bad spaceplanes have clearly been neglected in favour of rockets verdict 9 an outstandingly good vehicle buildersandbox game which is perfect for anyone with an interest in space the related physcis or anyone who likes building vehicles el k,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,kerbal space program at least to me is the king of simulation games while i play numerous others such as farming simulator they dont seem to hit every mark in that field ksp while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player and force them to deal with it while a game like farming sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops ksp requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity to a satellite connection back home but the part of the game that truly shines is the feeling you get when you first land on the mun a friend who gave the game a shot said originally posted by bacaber,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,608 hours in ive built fighter jets ive built icbms ive built massive capital starships still cant build a damn space station 10010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game has taught me which side of a rocket should point towards the ground if you want to go to space today and what happens if that end points towards space i now work for nasa,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,270 hours in the game still cant land on the mun 1010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ive learned at lot more about space in this game than i did in school i also kept missing school because i was playing it instead,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,do not purchase ksp if you seek life outside of pc gaming,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game ive ever played but it has also given me the greatest feeling of achievement from any game ive ever played when you land on the mun for the first time after mashing buttons trying to stabalise your craft and you barely make it due to the lack of fuel theres no better feeling than knowing you have to do it all again and launch a rescue mission or you could just leave bob there for science i am a big fan of space physics and science in general and playing this game has been an education for me because of ksp i have watched dozens of youtube videos on astrophysics and aerodynamics i would have probably never watched without this game and learned a ton of interesting things and i love that the game has a fantastic modding community with a huge variety of mods to add realism or give your game a futuristic scifi feel a favourite mod of mine is remote tech i dont play without it this game produces some stunning visuals too as you drift through the vast openness of space orbiting moons chasing asteroids collecting science and designing planes rockets trucks rovers probes boats even helecopters and mech walkertransformer type sh thanks to mods if you ever look up at the stars and wonder what it would be like to go there well this is as close as im ever gunna get,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,so i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review well here i am so i got this game around summmer 2015 after wanting it for a long time the game had just left early access and was in beta i just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game i adore this game most of my summer was spent playing this before you say that isnt possible i would like to point out my hours didnt add up as i ran the game from the exe rather than steam i would and have recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success science exploration engineering space cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of eachother and use them as landing gear the only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve i know the 11 update added loads of tutorials cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad but you will spend around 5 10 hours before you can do anything useful needless to say though it is worth it and soon you will conquer the solar system or yknow just abuse the various bugs the game has thats cool anyway thanks for reading this review if it helps someone buy the game or spread the word or anything then im glad simple concept,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i should build some rockets opens ksp eehhhhh closes ksp,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game made me discover scott manley 1010 would discover scott manley again,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this is my most played game it has brought me the most pain the most anger at times i feel like im playing dark souls in space with adorable little green men this game has done so much for the future of astrophysics these guys deserve global recognition for the excitement they have generated in new generations for space travel and exploration,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,mission control launch in 10 9 8 7 jeb im already at the mun guys mission control what how jeb well the rocket blew up and blasted me 11000 kilometers mission control not again but seriously buy this game its fantastic,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,gtwanted to reach mun gtcouldnt do it gtbuilded the most ed up spaceship i could imagine out of frustration gtworked better than all my other attempts gtcrashed into mun gt happiest moment of my life 1110 would put 28 rhino engines on rocket again,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,to begin i guess i should give a short description essentially ksp is a fairly realistic simulation game where you take control of and guide the nascent space program of a race of small green men and women from a planet named kerbin you will build your own vessels choose your targets for exploration colonization scientific endeavor etc and blast off for space the construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use and because of the level of customization available tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike there are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships several mods change this if you want but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate and make for a while unforgiving very fun game because the feedback is extremely consistent a mistake will kill you every time unless something hilarious happens this is actually one of the great parts of playing ksp i cannot say enough positive things about this game i purchased this originally in april of 2013 before it was on steam and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released ksp has few goals and in sandbox mode it has none but goals are not the reason to play ksp the first time i successfully put a kerbal in orbit around his home planet i was dancing around my dorm room and the first time i landed a kerbal on the mun i felt a sense of accomplishment i have quite literally never felt in a game before now over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play i have built massive colonies on laythe the mun minmus duna eve and even ike ive built huge orbital stations around various planets and ive even built floating cities in the clouds of jool and eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available ive built resource collection and transport systems including storage mining and transport operations ive explored hundreds of different areas with probes landers and vehicles and yet to this day i still play this game at least two to three hours a week and ill go on ksp binges several hours long when i think of a new challenge to set for myself currently a friend of mine and i are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic duna colonization project if you cant tell by now if you want an on rails game where everything is spoonfed to you just leave now this game is most certainly not for you the contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration but if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake then ksp is your game and when you finally put a kerbal safely on the mun you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about ksp,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,after 60 hours cant oribit properly cant get to the mun cant do anything i love it 1010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,not sure if im into this game need to play a bit more to confirm,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this is one of my favourite games its simply amazing ksp is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own watch scottmanley tutorials if you want a head start i had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet or keeping my rocket upright on the way there but now i am planing missions to other planets landing and returning sending unmanned rovers to explore or even bringing asteroids back home 800 hours in and i feel like i am still just at the beginning mn or bust unknown prob jebediah kerman or kurtjmac,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,orbital mechanics sounds like a boring subject until you throw a few green guys into a rocket ship that you have to pilot around a fictional solar system this belongs on your computer and in every science classroom across the globe,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,updated to release 10 fun 8 plot 6 ctrl 7 gfx 7 sfx 7 stable yes replay 9 total 8 most bugs are gone loads more to build and experiment with feminine kerbals are here and they are just as dumb some graphics and sound are still underwhelming lacks a much needed tutorial interface is still clunky slow and filled with buttons you dont know are there tough economics in career can leave you penniless still requires youtube tutorials to find stuff out sponsorships are not easy to figure out bug sets building upgrades to 0 allowing instant upgrade what was already a solid game is solidifying into a final product id love there to be some intro and cutscenes to get us closer to our kerbalnauts its still not bug free and does have an air of indiebeta about it but this is one project that is being run correctly and has been a joy to support as of release 09b kerbals are cute and fun to interact with sent screaming into space the complex physics of space flight is accessible hugely sense of reward in achieving even small steps for kerbal kind lots to do and experiment with regular updates and an active community of modders sound already is fun and adds to the atmosphere graphics are not phenomenal but are appropriate loading times are unoptimised but nothing bad some interfaces are unrefined but totally functional still in beta so issues are forgiveable and probably being resolved tutorial leaves out useful info and needs expanding sponsorships are not easy to figure out and broken what a hugely fun and charming game that demands your love and attention you care about your dim lil kerbals and its fun to see them flounder and succeed the science is well packaged to be accessible and if you take the time to experiment and read around the subject it becomes all the more rewarding recommended for those who like space science and being educated as they are entertained conclusion 810 a work in progress you can invest hours of enjoyment in already,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,best game ever taught me orbital mechanics better than any teacher ever could,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ive spent a little time with the game and feel that its worth playing,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,kerbal space program version 102 ive been playing the early access game for over 2 years but now that it became official i thought id write a review my review is very positive but see the caveat about version 10 below at the bottom full disclosure i dont work for squad but i do help write one of the mods for the game so i am personally invested in this get this game for once a scifi game that is actual scifi and not science fantasy it doesnt insult the intelligence of the player and it speculates whatif in a relatively reasonable way only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay rather than breaking all of them constantly like most space video games do kerbal space program as history although the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible so it doesnt take as long to get things done as it really would it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical realworld space programs dont be fooled by the cute derpylooking kerbals you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions space stations in low orbit docking maneuvers performing an apollostyle mun landing send rover probes to duna which is marslike and so on all from gluing together parts and having fun and if you really want to go allout there are user community mods out there that replace the games solar system with the real thing so you can really try these missions out in full size kerbal space program as a tycoon style game if you like the old style tycoon games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects then kerbal space program career mode is for you start up a new game pick career mode set normal or easy difficulty do not use hard until youve played a while and youll have the fun of trying to balance funding for making better space center buildings and for making the rockets themselves reputation for making future offers you see be better for you and science points for buying your way up the tech tree accept contracts and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do dont fail them or else youll lose funds and rep for it kerbal space program as a mod platform from its early access days a user community of modders has grown such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game as of this writing because ksp 102 is relatively new some of those mods wont work just yet but they will after only a week or two if past use is anything to go by thats about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release as steam is not the only means of obtaining the game and not even the first means of obtaining it the company squad has chosen not to support steam workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make steamonly mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on steam i support this decision but it does mean youll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them look up ksp on link removed cursecom and look for kerbalstuffcom most mods are in both places kerbal space program as edutainment the game is quite educational but in that good sneaky fun way where you dont realize youre learning youre just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way if youve got a teenager or preteen at home give this to them it does something that is really hard to do it demonstrates though gameplay how a mathematical concept works visually without revealing the actual formulas in such a way that the hard math can come after the intuitive understanding usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and feel cant happen until after you understand the numbers but here it lets you play with the phenomenon first and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you rather than the other way around get this game a caveat my review refers to the 102 version of ksp and emphatically not to the 10 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical reentry bug had i written the review about the 10 version it would not have been as kind the 10 release was rushed by about a week the 102 release from a week later was much better and is probably what should have been the 10 release re the ksp 10 reentry bug you may read reviews by people complaining about reentry being broken when 10 game out those reviews werent wrong at the time they were written ksp 10 was rushed out with a reentry bug that was very unfair and importantly really obvious so its hard to imagine how they missed it adding a heat shield actually caused the ship to blow up on reentry because adding it made the vessel flip nosefirst rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part if you see reviews complaining about this behavior be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,better than no mans sky,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ive only had this game for a month and ive already logged over 50 hours into it kerbal space program is not simply a game about building rockets launching them and seeing where they go its tagline is conquering space was never this easy and that is true it is easy compared to doing it in real life but dont let it fool you ksp actually has a pretty steep learning curve in the month that ive had this game ive only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of kerbin ksps version of earth i havent even gotten to a single moon or other planet but dont let that deter you look up tutorials for the game side note the ingame tutorials are actually pretty terrible i recommend finding ones online such as scott manleys who does a great job of explaining how the game works the sense of accomplishment you get when you do accomplish those tasks even if its just setting up a simple probe like i did is phenomenal and from what ive seen once you do manage to master the game you can do basically anything never give up all in all kerbal space program is not just a game its a lifestyle 1010,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,spent 150 hours sending a kerban into the sun 1010 would do again,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,there are very few things that are so good that everyone should at least try them ksp is among the top of that list regardless of your age,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,picked up a copy during its early access have been in love with it since,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ive learned more about physics from this game than from all my years of education unfortunately scifi frustrates me to no end now i know that the physics are all wrong,1,0
220200,Kerbal Space Program,the best thing about kerbal is when your crazy plans actually pan out for example before they added the claw one of my ships was stranded in highorbit with no fuel it was carrying valuable science but had no docking port so i built a rescue ship with a big metal butterfly net to capture the stranded ship manually and bring it safely home that worked in ksp you up the fun part is thinking of ridiculous plans to un up,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it ive played ksp off an on for a few years the game has a very active modmaking fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play my best review of this game is anecdotal i sent this to a friend when i was only a few hours into play i had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics anyone who plays ksp might find this story relatable one of my test flights put 3 kerbals into orbit they were low on fuel so i did a retrograde burn to bring them home except that i didnt do a retrograde burn i did a prograde burn by the time i realized it i had burned too much fuel to get them home i reduced their orbit as much as possible even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters they were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point with no way to return to the surface under their own power i had one option a rescue mission i built a new ship one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which i dubbed lost eagle lost eagle had been fitted with docking collar and i guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort the rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue the final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for its relatively low weight this would end up being the ultimate design flaw it was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before reentry docking is hard i would say impossible but ive seen videos of people doing it and i know it can be done but despite many hours and multiple misses i had got rescue 1 and lost eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away i closed enough distance that i felt it would be close enough to jump the first crew member from lost eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one it went pretty smoothly but in the process the ships drifted further apart i did a corrective burn on rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member success again 1 left he jumped this time from the furthest gap he too arrived successfully i felt a rush of success a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in todays video games plenty of fuel for the retro burn they were coming home this process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while the design of the reentry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip she wasnt pretty but she was light and efficient the plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere but i had discovered that i couldnt deploy the parachutes from the reentry craft it was a problem i had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but i was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit the whole thing still landed successfully in my tests at 5000m above the surface having survived reentry i pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes i dont know if i double tapped it or if i had just had my staging backwards but when i hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can knowing full well that there was nothing i could do to save the pilot of rescue 1 i watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival i quickly switched to the other part of the ship i tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them the hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs no controls that could be used to deploy the chutes again i watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second the game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission or even the assembly area where i could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals i chose not to i was angry at myself for the mistake i had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what i knew was a flawed design the empty ship lost eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any kerbal that looks up that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results i will be reminded of this every time i play the game,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ive already played this game for a couple of hours and i think its pretty nice,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,you will never forget your first mun landing,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,its like lego with explosions if thats not enough for you i dont know what is,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,possibly the best purchase of a digital product i have ever made pros educational but in an optional and completely natural manner makes light of a terrifying subject matter a true sandbox with no invisible walls or assumptions made about your competency a fairly accurate and interactive physics system with tools to help you use it almost everything in the game can explode melt or die with game options to prevent it might start you on a new found interest in real world space exploration extensive active and competent modding community development bug fixes continue long after official launch of the game cons the ingame universe feels a bit dead as there are no cities or npcs only a scattering of easter eggs that said you probably will not spent too much time actually on planets running around the planets are about 110th scale which is still huge and so might not notice updated post 11 release,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,in my steam library there are about a half dozen games that are in a special category called all time greats civ iv is there skyrim is in there ksp is in there note my play time does not include the 50100 hours i put in before the game was ever on steam simply one of the best products in the last decade ksp is not your typical game its a software toy you tinker you experiment you adjust you tweak and you have a grand time doing it ksp is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a superdeluxe space rocket that can go to the mun or eve with ease if it did that ksp would not be any fun besides if someone wants that buzz aldrins space race is available for sale on steam instead you get better at the game you develop an understanding of newtonian physics more than you ever thought you would you build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions youll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit youll pump your fist when you land on the mun for the first time and youll continue having fun what are you waiting for go buy it,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,776 hours in i dont know how to dock my spacecraft 1,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,its pretty good,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,have i played enough definitely not,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,i feel like a criminal for only paying 17 for this while it was on sale in early access fantastic game,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ill never forget what my estranged father said to me when he saw me playing ksp thats pretty coolyeah thanks dad here look you can see the orbits periapsisdad oh bye,1,1

220200,Kerbal Space Program,me and my friends take this game way to seriously practically had a functioning mission control room durring a lan party came to the point where our first successful touchdown on the mun felt like we won the lottery it was amazing this is a great game for anyone looking for 1 a fun simulator and not the boring ones that drag on 2 a great way to channel creativity and problem solving 3 something to feel proud about great game was once unsure about the price tag but looking back i wouldnt change a thing give it a try,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,as goofy as the game seems you will not find a more in depth and accurate space flight simulation out there yet at first its fun to build explosive and cobbled together monstrosities to launch into space and send crashing back to the ground but then you learn the basics then suddenly a successful mun landing becomes a point of pride and the next planet over becomes your new goal the career mode starts you with simple parts to be expanded through scientific discoveries and contractual financial incentives jebediah recommends this game to anyone worth their salt in a tin can floating among the stars,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,ok ive got lots of thinks to say about ksp but ill try to be clear so lets begin this game nowadays is the best flight simulator i ever seen the potentials of this game are endless you can do everything you want but this game wouldnt be the same without its community the ksps comunnity is on of the best comunnity in the games world seriously i dont have many hours on the game i hope not for too long but ive never seen rude persons yes youll say this game is only single player but trust me the community is amazing id like to thank everyone who helped me when i started playing there are tons of useful mod and if you have any questions certainly there will be an answer in some forums or in some webpage buy this game absolutely specially if you are smart and you like to planning and studying the wounderfull games mechanics,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,wonderful game long live games that encourage learning through actual fun,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,a wise man once said if at first you dont succeed add more mainsail thrusters this man was correct this man was me,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,rip to the hundreds of kerbins who died in tragic but mostly avoidable accidents,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,1 hour in bookmarked useful orbital manuvers 10 hours in put sitcky note reminders on screen 50 hours in doodled rocket designs on the back of any avalibe piece of paper 100 hours in drew the kebin system on desk for mission planning 200 hours later wrote mission plans and equations on walls 1010 would deface walls again,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,how i first plotted to go to moon 1 build a rocket failure 2 build a bigger rocket failure 3 build chains of larger rockets towering over each other failure what have i learned from this game i am good at killing kerbals,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,kerbal space program aka one thousand ways to definitely not build a rocket coming from a physicist i love this game and all of my physicsmathcsengineering friends love it too granted thats a pretty narrow selection of people but judging from all the other good reviews id say our opinions reflect the general consensus you should buy this game then you should go tell everyone you know about it then maybe public opinion on space exploration will get a bit of a nudge back toward where it belongs,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,top 5 things that taught me orbital mechanics 5 apollo 13 1995 tom hanks bill paxton kevin bacon 13 amazoncom 4 highschool physics newtonian mechanics free australian education system 3 undergraduate physics degree keplerian motion one body mechanics 8000 year uq 2 postgraduate physics degree analytic twobody solutions computational rungekutta simulations 10000 uq 1 kerbal space program 30,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game is my favorite ever each new achievement was a huge thrill it was such a rush when i actually achieved orbit for the first time actually managed to land on the mun in one piece for the first time each small victory was a big thrill only downside is theres a big learneidn curve and yes the game is very challenging id strongly recommend this game,1,0

220200,Kerbal Space Program,very fun game you can either mess around and make silly contraptions or you can be full on nasa and have to do everything correctly i really reccomend ksp because ive had a great time playing and messing around on it,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,kerbin we have a problem bill kerman in the command pod next to jeb who opened the hatch during reentry first of all i played this game for a long time way before the 10 release not on steam no to be honest the is probably the best game i ever played in my whole life i mean im an astronomy nerd for almost 9 years and trust me this is real space travelling this game will entertain you for the rest of your life and if you like astronomyairplanes or looking at a star during night at all this game cant go wrong this game allows you to play in 3 different modes and the ultimate goal is to explore different bodies and complete researches however the 3 different levels has their own way of fun too so the basic mechanic of the game is you put together a craft in anyway you want and with any parts you want then you do the calculations for a specific mission or not they you fly it you can build a plane and fly around or build a rocket to go visit the different planets and the moons in the system you can actually do anything you want in the game capture and asteriod dock to make a station or go mining on the mun so learn real rocket science by starting this game now 1110 would complete a jool allmoon landing mission and forget to bring parachute when going back to kerbin 1210 would attach a solid booster to a vtol 1310 would unorbit a space station that i built for 10 month just to see the solar panels snap 1410 would spend 200 hours of the game calculating and design a ship so that it will glich through jool 1510 would spend 2 hours trying to make a kerbal dance on the narrowband scanner you can do that 1610 would blast a kerbal with a kerbodyne engine to let it fly 1710 would script edit and make the sperators have 10000000 ejection force and name it velocity injector 1810 would slingshot around all the moons in jool and glich through jool launching yourself at 5144255345ms 1910 would build an aircraft carrier then attach a f22 to it and build a aircraft catapult using the velocity injector it crashed the plane not the game 2010 would 911 the va i mean nothing 2110 will play kerbal for the rest of my life now with the new update of 12 new communication networks and etc the game got even better and even cheaper so with the 12 update its worth your 23 bucks and i think i made myself loud and clear haha okay get it,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,you know when i first saw this game way back in early access i thought cartoony throw away game not worth the effort but then i researched a little and watched a couple of episodes on youtube detailing game play i was more than intrigued i bought the game in what was called early access beta but it was already pretty polished i think that was in versions 6 or so i became ok and landed on mun and minimus several times many many times actually and maxed out science just by going to mun and minimus and getting every biome but then i set the game aside i didnt want to be burned out on it before it actually left beta i recently returned and almost ragequit many things have changed everything i thought i knew i had either forgotten or didnt work anymore i have played it a lot the last few days i have had a lot of successes and a lot of failures but i am essentially back to where i was before i quit the learning curve is pretty steep do you want to just fly out of the atmosphere fairly easy to figure out do you want to fly to one of the moons land and then take off with the expectation of getting back to kerbin kerbals earth its going to take a lot more knowledge i do recommend this game but i have to agree with someone else unless youre an engineer by nature youre probably going to need help at some point because this game is not a childs game it is tough but rewarding i try not to look at too much on youtube because i dont want to spoil it for myself but i am to the point that it is going to take a drastic rethinking of what im doing or i am going to need to watch tutorials to get anywhere out of kerbins orbit and get back safely i sent an unmanned probe to duna basically kerbins mars i was not able to bring it back thankfully no kerbals were killed on that adventure yes id say get this game if you see it on sale then grab it immediately i guess i have put 170 hours in to it ill probably put thousands into it before it is all over,1,1
220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game is nothing short of amazing while seemingly simple at first the game quickly shows how much it has to offer there is a whole solar system for you to discover planets to land on and attempt a return from in the stock game and with a large and active modding base the combinations for rocket types and adventures are endless the game also gives you a far better appreciation of the difficulties challenges and indeed triumphs of actual space programs past and present from various types of custom built rockets space planes space stations and installations on other worlds that can be constructed kerbal reminds us how good games can be and is a game that will definitely not leave you disappointed and keep you coming back for more and more as the amount of sleep you get dwindles away,1,0

220200,Kerbal Space Program,this game is worth twice the asking price if youre into science learning or just watching stuff explode this game is for you pros 1 lots to do you have an entire solar system and its all yours to explore 2 one of the best communities around 3 many greatr mods which btw are very easy to install most of them you simply drop the mod folder into the gamedata folder and presto 4 you will sink many many fun filled hours into this game cons 1 steep learning curve 2 can be frustrating from time to time 3 you will sink many many fun filled hours into this game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this game looks so awesome and challanging no spotting no hipfire croshair no minimap no killcam no health meter no hit kill notification not even an ammo counter it really forces you to trust your instincts and your teamates due to the lack of information it feels so rewarding to confirm a kill or win a game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is a strange animal a blend of various ideas characterized by other games like counterstrike red orchestra and the cult classic firearms mod that manages to do a very good job at providing a tactical hardcore shooter experience on paper insurgency seems very normal two teams the classic pushconquestobjective style game types and guns however thats pretty much all insurgency has in common with its modern military shooter bretheren insurgency is mechanically a very different beast lets start with spawns instead of having reinforcement pools like battlefield or red orchestra insurgency uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow it sounds weird sure but it works extremely well in practice lets take a basic game mode skirmish five objective points conquest style each teams closest points to defend are objectives that can be destroyed which removes them from the map and tightens up the cap order each team starts with 2 spawn waves these spawn waves kick in every 60 seconds or so anyone alive by then stays alive anyone dead by the end of this timer comes back every time an objective is captured another spawn wave is added to the capping team this means that players are not only incentivized to do objectives in order to extend their own playtime but it also increases the teams overall effectiveness it also means that rounds can take a while or be over extremely quickly depending on the degree of teamwork and individual player ability to stay alive the other thing that this game does very well mechanically is its gunfights in other tactical realism games like red orchestra or arma an average engagement is a sniper fest whoever sees em first ends it pretty much instantly now dont get me wrong insurgency has its share of ingloriously quick deaths and sniping corridors but an average mediumrange gunbattle can often devolve into a standup fight involving suppression repositioning and grenades much like a real fight part of this is enabled by the fantastic sound design and particle effects guns are spectacularly loud a blinding amount of smoke and dust gets kicked up from fully automatic fire and suppression effects seriously mess with a players accuracy ducking away from a window to have a burst of automatic fire rip up where you were just seconds ago is quite unnerving insurgency also seems to be one of the few games that really understands that shooting a real firearm often results in a sort of almostblindness from the muzzle blast and recoil which makes attempting to shoot enemies less of a lineupandclick moment and more of frantically fire in their general direction and hope they dont shoot back tldr the guns feel realistic and meaty and getting shot at is freaky with that said however i must be clear with you insurgency is not a game attempting infantry combat simulation like arma or red orchestra the accuracy and damage dealt by the games large selection of weapons is on par with those kinds of games but this is also a game tuned for balance and fun there isnt any superflous mechanics like changing the zeroing on your ironsights or wounding like ro2 does but it does make thematic concessions like fully animated fire selector switches the inventory and loadout system also emphasizes that its still very much a game the end of rounds gives your team supply points which you can then use to build your characters weapons kit you can equip armor to hopefully increase your survivability by a shot or two attach a 4x scope to your sks to plink at range with it or shunt your points into a slowhandling rocket launcher which is good for objectives and heavy suppression there is no grindy metagame progression system like call of duty its just the loadout and inventory all based on your teams performance in and out of rounds kind of like counterstrike as someone who cut their teeth on games like red orchestra i can say this about insurgency it is not the most hardcore realistic shooter ive played but it is most definitely the most fun ive had with a realistic teambased shooter for an early access game they have a very good product released as of this date 122913 i havent had a single crash yet it looks amazing and runs like a dream they also have quite a selection of maps and wellbalanced gameplay to top it all off if what ive said sounds good at all to you go on and get this game even if it isnt on sale its worth it,1,1
222880,Insurgency,one of the best fps game i have ever played its more realistic than counter strike but not as hardcore as arma by default there are no health bars no ammo indicators no crosshairs and no kill messages kill messages can be toggled on by the server enemies drop quick in this game if youre using ap rounds usually in 12 shots the sniper guns m14fal m40a1 mosin will kill in one shot with ap ammo even if the target has heavy armor all guns will kill with one shot to the head most bullets that are able to pass through a wall will retain enough energy to kill someone in one shot to the head guns shoot straight you dont get an unrealistic spread cone like counter strike and shotguns are still lethal long range using slugs suppressive fire exists and its tactical however there is no bullet drop at all teamwork heavy armor and being tactical wins the game this game also has a better community and less 12 year olds than most fps games such as counter strike and call of duty the best gamemode and the one i play most often is ambush even though i got this game for 25 cents 1 for a 4 pack in a humble bundle it is worth the 15 in its entirety i highly recommend this game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,i decided to hold off on writing a review until there were a few more updates and for me to have at least 500 hours invested into the game i am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff short and sweet should you get it it depends on what type of fpss you like many cs players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and theyve grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have dont doubt it for a second this game is hard to pick up on but once you do you realize how well reflexes really help if youre rushing but dont expect to be 360 noscoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe just dont be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything there are few grenade c4 or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating so that is why im really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and dont feel as constrainedguided heights and buhriz are like that but i still love them maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great the devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps always on top of it so kudos to them community engagement is stronger than ive ever seen it there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of the digital gaming league is starting their first official insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up the nightfall update just added so much more to the game it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning leaning mechanic feels more stiff meaning not fluidly unnatural the night vision is spot on and wellbalanced flares look awesome in the night sky but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now i preffered it the way it was before but i wont nitpick things for the sake of the length of this review also the new coop survival is an amazing idea i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends i could write a list of 10000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself it needs to be experienced the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something kills are rewarding objectives are highly valued teamwork is vital you need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter 122014 edited formatting new update 5316 1290 hours logged i just cant seem to get enough new maps improvements feautures etc oh and a new insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea community is growing steadily a lot more pick up games pugs than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive my only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked the future of insurgency is looking very healthy,1,1
222880,Insurgency,300 hours in and havent written a review well guess its time for one what do you get when you buy insurgency 24 maps across 10 different game modes a large and active community of players thousands of workshop mods to customise your game to your liking regular free updates that bring new maps weapons modes etc possibility for competitive 5v5 play an extremely based development team who actively partake in the community and listen to their fans high speed high lethality close quarter combat combined with realistic weapon handling hipfire freeaim minimalistic hud and lack of hit markers and hit indicators youll be in for a sweet white knuckle grip ride and all at a moderate price of 15 so what are you waiting for,1,1
222880,Insurgency,intense amp atmospheric attractive for teamplayers,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is a refreshingly new intense multiplayer fps expect no kill cam no crosshairs no radar no medic or healing no enemy damage notification this is all hardcore realism of fun maps offer a good mix for long open lanes for snipers and confined areas for short range encounters 8 game modes from firefight search amp destroy skirmish strike push and so on there are also cooperative missions gun loadouts lets you choose various amount of classes before the game starts from support rifleman sniper assault sharpshooter and so many more while customising your build each costs a amount of points but your choices will also effect your weight the more you carry the slower you move its still has a active server population of roughly 1500 people online who play it daily and the developers have continued to add new content to the game if you are into these tactical shooters and youre also looking for a truly immersive combat experience then this game could be for you ive been enjoying playing for many hours now so incredibly addictive and challenging highly recommended,1,1
222880,Insurgency,updated i bought this in the sale for like 3 and i honestly feel like ive scammed the developer realistic atmosphere great guns incredible community sniping is just so much damn fun and its one of the few games which actually gets the scopezoom right imagine counterstrike battlefield and red orchestra all got together and had a baby 1010 update after owning this game for about 2 and a half years now i am truly astonished with how new world interactive is treating this game the game even in early access i think it was ea anyway or couldve been just a beta was pretty damn good and yet they have never stopped improving it and trying to make it the best it can possibly be even now theyre starting to port the whole game over to unreal engine 4 add a campaign story and also add esports elements if i had the spare money i would honestly buy the game again and gift it to a random friend who may want it just to show my gratitude to such an incredible development team who deserve every penny that they make bravo nwi it is just a shame the big boys dont copy you ubisoft ea etc a truly incredible development team with an even better game lt3,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this game is really weird no crosshair no minimap no hit feedback no red triangles above enemy heads no medipacks no killcam no colorfull weapon skins no 100 popping up when kill someone no matchmaking you cant call a airstrike after a killstreak you cant aim while crawling you cant bunny hop moving sideways is much slower you dont need to go for the headshot 2 chest shots with akar are enough to kill you can kill your teammates you have to find a server in a server browser and so on so what is this game its the most realistic and intense but still fast paced and very fun to play mp shooter available best 2 ive ever spent on steam cant await insurgency 2 edit the gameplay is like battlefield3 infantry only hardcore but more realistic see above ammo left doesnt stack every mag is separate a rocketeer has only one rpg roles have limited slots so 10 snipers in one team is not possible and so on beside the source engine and the fact that you can be oneshoted and have to be very carefull the gameplay has not much common with csgo if you play csgo because you think its realistic its not and you dont really enjoy it this game is for you if you like bf3 infantry only but want more realism this game is for you if you want to cod akimbo p90 spray and pray run n gun this game wont make you happy i hope this answers the questions about the gameplay,1,1
222880,Insurgency,for 15 dollars i got 24 maps interesting gunplay mechanics 32 weapons fun and balanced gun customization fantastic mod support 13 gamemodes immersive and detailed gameplay mechanics arguably some of the best graphics youll see on source engine an awesome community players and developers free dlc for 15 dollars i didnt get microtransactions season passes half dlc what im trying to say is support the devs thank you new world interactive,1,1
222880,Insurgency,i killed 4 people with an rpg and my entire team started screaming allahu akbar for 5 minutes 1010,1,0
222880,Insurgency,tldr rainbow six red orchestra a bit of counterstrike and a sprinkle of attachments like battlefield but without dumb unlocks a solid tactical shooter with a slow pace and punishing timetokill where a few bullets will take you down insurgency is rainbow six in iraq with lots of sudden death and ptsd and jumping because youre shot out of nowhere its a game of hideandseek with laser sights betraying their owners position and footsteps betraying your own position imagine if red orchestra had a baby with rainbow six its got a lot of that in its blood in fact one of the original devs for ro is the guy behind insurgency now the hypothetical rainboworchestra child was raised by counterstrike some roundbased game modes and not all of them have respawns without some major coordination its a tense package where you might go with no kills or a lot depending on how well you can plan ahead with your teammates because if you dont get the drop on your enemies youre dead before the bullets leave the chamber if you liked the mod youll like this if you like red orch but in the scale of the older rainbow six games youll like this on a scale of 20 i give it three thumbs up and 25 off coupon to a medium 2topping pizza at participating locations would recommend,1,0
222880,Insurgency,i started playing insurgency modern infantry combat many many years ago as a mod as soon as i heard they were making a standalone i bought it without thinking twice throughout early access the developers listened to what the community had to say and made changes accordingly i have heard the developers say several times that they made it to play it this is the best mindset a developer could have and it shows even though the kickstarter for insurgency failed the developers managed to keep it alive long enough to enter early access on steam their dedication to this game is really amazing the game has a minimal hud meaning your screen isnt cluttered up with useless things such as a minimap they also implemented a 3d voip system that allows you to hear anyone including the enemy at a realistic distance if you decide to talk to a squad member over the radio and an enemy just so happens to be on the other side of a doorway god bless it requires a good amount of teamwork and communication in order to win there are a large amount of original game modes some of these modes were taken directly from the mod such as push and some are brand new ambush all of the game modes are original and are mostly based off of capturing points rather than getting kills one of the main problems i had with red orchesta 2 was the super clunky movement controls this game has very smooth controls but still manages to keep it medium paced you will find it necessary to rush a corner sometimes and other times you may need to wait for the enemy to move up running and gunning in this game is very very hard to do when insurgency was released from early access the developers decided that it was in their best interest to lower the price read that sentence again usually games that come out of early access raise their prices but the developers of insurgency decided to cut the price down and increase the playerbase if thats not dedicated i dont know what is this game is easily up there with the 60 games and you can get it for 15 bucks or less i have played over 600 hours and i loved every minute,1,1
222880,Insurgency,first game that has killed me in the training 1010,1,0
222880,Insurgency,for 15 you get 15 guns 15 attachments 30 maps night day c4s and ieds free workshop content custom gamemodes and much much more there are no healthbars no radars no powerups perks or killstreaks no indicators for kills no flying or jetpacks nor wall scalingclimbing cough cough infinite warfare no stamina bar no ammo indicator on your hud just your magazine count its only you your gun your plate carrier your chest rig and your grenades you dont get killed in 10 shots you get killed in one you cant carry a lmg an ak a shotgun heavy armor 2 grenades and a rpg your not hulk worth every penny,1,1
222880,Insurgency,red orchestra modern warfare the gunplay is amazing i never thought that such detailed recoil and bullet penetration are possible on source if that alone is not enough for you here is why you should buy it game is under active development the version i bought in august and what i have at december are different it feels like its a sequel already map design ui gameplay sounds everything evolved and changed in a positive way and developers are not afraid of hotfixes thats how you do an early access the sound if you have good sound card and speakersheadphones setup youll hear one of the best gunshots sounds at least the best i ever heard yes its better than war tapes settings for bfbc2 or bf3 while its not yet enabled for all maps ones like district are just a joy to listen in 51 the weapon handling is very well done it feels like the real thing it looks like the real thing it kills like the real thing attachments are done right too you dont consider them like an upgrades they are to change weapon behavior in a special way most of the time im using the gun in plain ironsight mode because it fit my play style more contains 5 different game modes for each map like skirmish from the original mod all classic team deathmatch firefight last team standing vip escort and everyones favorite push aka rush aka attackdefense,1,0
222880,Insurgency,i literally stopped playing cs since i started this game original cs 16 i still love but this game is a beast compared to csgo no colorful toy guns havent encountered hackers yet and the immersion is epic very realistic fps game and after the last night update it just got so much better for me it beats all the other fps games that are out there right now ps its hard to find good servers from se asia but i play fine in european and other servers even with 200 ping wish we had servers here but game still is very playable for me in that ping,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this game is 10 luck 20 skill 15 concentrated power of the will 5 pleasure 50 pain and 100 reason to purchase the game,1,0
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is a hardcore fps at its finest which doesnt follow current fps trend the game strips you of most realism shooter mechanics such as a cross hair and simply says hunt or survive from my point of view it combines all the best features of counter strike red orchestra and arma this game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where youve been shot from it doesnt take many shots to kill fewer from the neck up and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate and also where the objectives are thats it no radar either which makes the game even more involving and friendly fire is always on at any time and it is forgivable however i would not recommend this game to people who only like really arcadey shooters like cod and bf since these two are really casual comparing with insurgency but if you really try to explore this game well i would say you may find much more teamwork and strategies here what i love the most about this game is how difficult it is and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates i havent seen a game like insurgency for a long timeexcept for csgo we need more games like insurgency and less of the cod advanced bullst that we are overwhelmed with nowadays this is a game will never disapoint you,1,1
222880,Insurgency,a overall amazing game has potential to compete with shooters like csgo battlefield and even arma to some extent gun mechanics are finally a break from the you have 90 bullets in your ar15 and they magically go in your mag when reloading some qualityoflife and realism improvementsthings id like to see more guns more character interaction the character voice interaction is a1 in this game surpression being more useful making your screen a little bit blurry doesnt do that much especially support classes would benefit from this as their main role is to lay down surpression fire over long distances maybe make it so if you get surpressed you start to yell more giving away your position and maybe being more innacurate guns dont come out of the scope ffs maybe make it so when you are being surpressed or in adrenaline rush you reload faster or something when you aim down sights while standing for too long your hands get tired and your sightsscopes start to sway depending on gun weight this will help against rpgs maybe clips for mosin more voice interaction make it so when you are in need to switch to your handgunget a grenade you can drop your weapon instead of holsting it then slowly taking out your throwablegun maybe we will see inclusion of shoulder gun belts more voice interaction please overall i rate this game 8910 also props to k for suggestions edit guns are noisy as in real life especially lmgs sniper rifles and shotguns indoors if you keep spamming that lmb you will probably get some ear disease add earpro as a accessory this will also make surpressors more useful by the way surpressors dont make the gun go phoosh theyre still loud make going prone faster like plunching yourself on your belly when getting fired at muzzle flashes are a big deal when shooting at night edit 2 add a 357 revolver that you can load either 357 rounds or 38spc rounds obviously the 357rounds will do more damage but will kick a lot more and the 38spc rounds will have much less recoil due to the low power and gun weight but will damage less making it a good hitandrun weapon maybe maybe add so you can adjust grain ammount in bullets maybe make a hollow point p abomination rifle that will oneshot unarmored opponents,1,1
222880,Insurgency,you dash toward the corner barely escaping a rain of bullets down the hallway mowing down your teammates in front of you you take a second to adjust your position then quickly peek around the corner and unloaded a burst of ak rounds into that barely conceivable shadow of the enemy behind the counter in the dark room you go flank alone sneak into the next room and see three enemies back facing you you swore under your breath that you didnt spend a few points on a suppressor take a deep breath to stop yourself from panicing out and shooting uncontrollably then fire a short quick burst into each of their asses before they realize whats happening as you charge toward the bomb site you literally run into an enemy both of you freak out and started blindfire your gun start to shake as his bullests thunder by and your vision turns blurry from his muzzle blast but you get lucky and managed to knock him down before he gets to it first youre sure the sound of that shot came from above that giant rock in front of you you kneel down slowly and surely move up the gravel slope trying to cover every angle in front of you without making any sound as you climb to the top you look around carefully and finally see that sniper bellying behind that bush his giant boots betraying his position you smirk switch to your knife and sink the blade deeply into his exposed butt those are all real insurgency moments i had during the beta long time insurgency player since the original mod and dare i say that insurgency is the best infantry combat game out there its slightly arcady in the sense that you dont need to learn 25000 key mappings to do things down to kneejerking its realistic in the sense that your hud is stripped down to minimal which means one you actually have to look hard to tell what youre shooting two your view is super clear for you to do so insurgency managed to explain the term firefight in the purest form on smaller tactical game modes youll see players break into small groups or single out followed by short gunfights breaking out across the map on larger sustained game modes its common to see many players grouping up taking points pushing and holding for objectives while exchanging franantic automatic fire those adrenalin rushes oh so good,1,0
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is relatively realistic it looks like a ken burns documentary compared to call of dutys and battlefields more hollywood approach for one thing your screen isnt filled with information you have no health bar no compass no map and no aiming reticule flashy text doesnt congratulate you after every killwithout it insurgency looks cleaner and more authentic than its peers letting you focus on strategy and action instead of keeping track of an enemys location on a minimap in the corner of the screeninsurgency also doesnt have a lot of the flash you see in modern shootersat first glance youll want to compare insurgency to counterstrike both are competitive teambased shooters that pit terrorists against counterterrorist forces but the two play differently while you only get one life per a round of counterstrike most game modes in insurgency permit you to revive your entire team if you complete an objective like capturing a certain point on the map or destroying a weapon cachethis dynamic provides for some fun comebacksinsurgency offers roles like demotion sniper and recon but you cant necessarily be whatever you want each match offers a set number of slots for each class the available loadouts change depending on the map and mode youre playing since insurgency is so much more realistic than most shooters its also a good deal more complicated and less forgivingalso you wont find any sort of training or singleplayer mode so your only option if you want to improve is to jump into some online matches and suffer through some punishment insurgency was originally a sourcebased mod but this standalone release still uses the almost 10yearold game engine as a result insurgency isnt the mostdetailed game with a lot of textures looking flat and dated ultimately insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay the action is highly competitive and focusedsure it doesnt have the flash that most shooters proudly throw at your face these days but insurgencys quieter more realistic and tenser take on modern warfare deserves a look especially if youre tired of instant knife kills and exploding buildings,1,1
222880,Insurgency,the real reason why insurgency isnt as popular as it should be csgo player plays insurgency does spray pattern with the ak complains that this game is gets killed by a grenade complains grenades are op gets knifed from the front wtf knifes cant do that gets one hit by a 1911 wtf pistols cant do that says where is the bomb at gets teamkilled complains the community is toxic and leaves buys a 300 virtual knife,1,0

222880,Insurgency,insurgency scroll to bottom for a quick summary what is insurgency a tactical first person shooter that emphasis on communication and strategy made with the source engine this game may not look pretty but for the gameplay it really doesnt need to the gameplay is not for the rambos of the community what i mean by saying that is you cannot rush in guns blazing the hp in this game makes most deaths near to instant this makes the pace of alot more rythmic and steady forcing you to check that corner make sure the objectives are clear etc this by no means makes your ability to aim any less important the game being focused on realism makes weapons with heavy recoil and bright muzzle flashes there is no killing based objective mode in insurgency each mode is heavily objective based forcing you to work with your team to capture the objective each team has a certain ammount of waves that determine the games length so those more intent on fragging are still aiding the team unfortunately some game modes are fairly boring and some are completely unbalanced for certain sides coop a really big feature of this game up to 8 people per map can work your way through a series of modes that will test your skill and communication against bots that really do live up to the brutal difficulty there are no mistakes failure when your whole team dies you can respawn your team when an objective is captured coop is a really enjoyable addition just as challenging and popular as multiplayer it will keep you on your toes constantly the game is altogether alot of fun and for alot of people there is a good chance that this will become a regular pasttime of yours graphics 410 really catches the atmosphere workshop support can upgrade some aspects source engine really shows its age lots of textures are repeated not clear what objects have different levels of bullet penetration gameplay 710 really fun teamwork based you are forced to play the role you pick to a degree workshop can add alot of fun additions maps are well made and most are well balanced leaderboards and mvp displays really give you a sense of achievement and encourage competition coop is really good night maps make for a nice change and add whole new elements to the game great sound and immersion a different way to approach most situations some game modes sadly require blatant camping some game modes are very unbalanced some guns are wildly underpowered or overpowered workshop allows performance enhancing addons clearer sights player models etc anti cheat is lacking connection to steam servers can be dodgy overall 610 agree or disagree with something in the review comment please all feedback is appreciated hope this helps,1,1
222880,Insurgency,my friend told me this game looked like call of duty i laughed then i did what any reasonable person would do pulling out a claymore i screamed allahu akbar at the top of my lungs as i sacrificed myself for allah and wiped his ignorant face off the planet actual review boy did i hate this game when i first got it looks like a fast paced shooter right i downloaded it deciding that it would be something new maybe similar to csgo i enter my first game and get a sniper im a pretty good awper in csgo so why not try sniping i run out of spawn hmm this is weird the running feels like im actually running the movement is crisp i was loving the game already a smile crosses my face as i see someone all the way across the map a target focused i scoped in i lined my crosshairs onto his head and what the fuuuuuuuu my body collapses i am dead who killed me what the butt just happened i shake my head this life will be different i run outside and long story short die an hour later i have killed 3 people and died around 50 times what was i expecting a fastpaced 420 blaze it mlg game what did i get a slowpaced gritty realistic extremely teamworkbased tactical shooter that makes you think before every action and to be honest thats what made the game so much better for me its different its unique and its rewarding kills fill you with pride you realize that youre actually doing something the other team doesnt have infinite respawns so you just contributed to victory this feeling of being a part of team and capturing points makes this game like no other buy this game and play it with friends your first hour or two will be brutal and you will die constantly but once you figure out what youre doing this truly is amazing i know most people arent going to read the long text i have above so below i have a proscons list because thats all people look for in reviews anyways pros very realistic teamworkoriented extremely fun with friends mods allow you to change your game uilooksmusic seriously i have the murica f yeah music playing at the start of my rounds and my knife is just a spatula rewarding unique different shooter experience indie devs that listen to their community and even promote some of the modders lots of updates many different maps and game modes very polished for an early access very few hackers cons bullet drop not possible with source engine not too important but detracts from realism if they ever add maps large enough for this to matter very frustrating to get into like seriously very frustrating im not joking i still suck hardcore at the game and ive spent quite a few hours in it default setting allows you to join empty servers very insignificant but a little annoying sometimes competitive matchmaking needs lots of work people leave randomly with no punishment and games are reset without warning also the use of voice chat is not promoted enough in csgo people use voice chat because there is a clear objective that everyone strives for in insurgency competitive people split up at round start to do their own thing and there doesnt seem to be any sort of actual competitive gameplay happening part of this is lack of an actual objective sure youre supposed to capture points but thats a lot less defined and concrete than in csgo where you have to plantdiffuse the bomb lack of a clear defined interesting objective makes people less inclined to care enough about the game to talk and strategize with each other game has a few bugs here and there but is ea,1,1

222880,Insurgency,this game is basic or rather all about the basics its you its your gun its your team its the enemy there are no health bars no kill streaks no indicator on how many enemies are down or if you did or did not kill someone its simply about trying to best your opponent as someone who leads a team of over 30 players into the field lemme give you a piece of advice learn the maps knowing where your enemies are most likely to be expected will win or loose the game for you coordinate with your team this is one of the games where the voip feature is realoly an asset instead of a nuisance sound is important listen to the footsteps around you maybe one of the enemy team is distracted enough to call his teammates on the radio close to you enabling you to hear their strategies find the balance between being aggressive or waiting for an enemys failure one shot can and will often mean your death but being too slow can mean inevitable defeat if youre not that much into the pvp high pressure aspect however this game also features an extensive coopmode with five different modes and loads of servers out there if you will please trust someone who spent over 300 hours into insurgency this game although extremely cheap can rival every single triplea title in terms of content with the only disadvantage being the games somewhat inferior graphics source engine and a lack of a real ladder or rankedsystem just dont expect to be instantly rewarded for kills like in cod in bf or even in csgo killing someone is fine but at the end of the day you are a team and you will win or fall as a team,1,1
222880,Insurgency,wow just wow ive been told this game is just a standalone upgrade of the source insurgency mod and im very sad face that i missed that gem hands down the best infantry gamenot too sim not too arcadey ive ever seen played it still runs on the source engine so you wont be see amazing graphics but the upside is that the source engine can run on a potato so you can still run 200 fps with ease in case you want to take advantage of the client speed being slightly faster with higher fps even though your monitor wont render past the 60120 refresh rate interface wise its the closest thing to minimally immersive that ive seen in a shooter you get the basic ui showing what points are capped your fire mode on your weapon and how many magazines you have left it wont show you current ammo so you have to estimate how much you have fired from the current mag the weapons you carry will appear in the fadeout box only when you switch weapons like usual no minimap showing you where the enemies or your teammates are so you have to figure it out for yourself be it the bullets flying by to clock your enemies position or calling out through voip to make sure no friendly fire happens when you cross flanks there is a label on your teammates to give you that little help in deciding who is friendly though if you pay attention hopefully they will add a server option to disable this the bullet count is even realistic which so many other shooters try to simplify the magazines left are just that magazines there is no magical extra pouch that you dump the unused rounds to somehow top off the last mag you have so you have to decide if you want to top off or risk running out of rounds mid firefight although for some reason you get an absurd amount of spare mags the mags you replaced without being empty will actually go the bottom of your stash then when you get to them you end up shooting like 2 rounds then having to switch mags again kind of annoying but kind of an awesome way to use up the unspent rounds when you are low on ammo now im not a fan of freeaim where your gun isnt locked in place on the center of the screen but it fits so perfectly in this kind of game it isnt overly done like in ro2s full screen freeaim there is a deadzone that will freeaim then turn when you reach the edges it will force you to ads also not a fan of in other games if you need the accuracy which also isnt ridiculously instant like in other action shootersvisual delay only and the movement in ads mode will actually sway instead of snap making op drag shot a little less potent the freeaim deadzone is pretty realistic giving you realistic accuracy and rewarding you for instinct shooting from high ready there is also emphasis on crouching in front of teammates so you dont get shot in the back prone to get better cover or even feigh death behind cover there is no kill confirmation the realism really has a red orchestra feel to it but in a modern setting the respawn system really makes you value your life because anyone who dies wont respawn until your team has captured a point or the next wave comes in sustained mode which also encourages grouping up instead of just running gunning and dieing so the gameplay may seem slow at first because of this but that all changes when you get into a firefight from calling out where enemies are to staying behind cover and watching bullets wiz past your head you really feel like you are in the thick of it the maps are extremely well made there are multiple places you can fire from lots of buildings with windows and cover and encourage teamplay even more with a common tactic being team a advances while team b covers and suppress fire or throw smoke to rush the maps can feel a bit asymmetrical but this is infantry realism you are not always going to be on equal terms recommended that you have a mic on the ready because the voip is pretty crucial in communication its somewhat positional audio so its easier to tell who is talking just by the direction of the voice but beware enemies can hear you too if you are too close to them positional audio is just that it will also help when flanking calling it out so you dont get murdered by your own team when you come around a corner also dont expect neglectful devs the devs for this game are very involved and determined to make this game happen ive even run into a few devs while playing and constantly responding to forum posts so its not like they are going to easily give up on a game they actually play,1,0

222880,Insurgency,basic information,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency insurgency is a fps hardcore tactial shooter there is no campaign meaning that all the attention is on multiplayer there are two teams that are pitted against each other sercurity forces us and insurgents middle eastern extremist there are a multitude of very enjoyable maps some take place in day and some in night making the flashlight a viable option the game does a many things very well the game is extremely realilistic in the sense that 12 shots will kill please be careful your gun will also lock when jumping in the air sorry no 360 noscopes footsteps are a very good indication of where enemies may reside so you have to be very silent when moving some things that this game does not do well hit registration it is actually horrible and this subtracts from the immersion of the game when you clearly hit someone and they dont go down it can also be very fustrating ping really effects your gameplay in this game as i said before hit registration is even worse when you have a ping of over 100 another fantastic part of this game is the steam workshop find weapon skins custom ui custom sound packs well pretty much custom everything this game is really easy to run on almost any system you will run the game at highest settings at atleast 45 fps on almost every map overall i really enjoy playing this game and the team still bring out updates but they are not as frequent as they shoudl be 810,1,1
222880,Insurgency,the most exciting immersive fun and lethal multiplayer fps i have ever played the battlefield,1,1
222880,Insurgency,many of the games at a 60 price arent worth that amount this game is definitely worth more than 15 it doesnt matter if its on sale you should get this game and tell your friends to get it here is why i have accumulated over 1200 hours on this game and have actually founded a competitive insurgency team its only fair that i give the game the review it deserves if you want to know about a lot about the game before you buy it youre reading the right review the competitive scene the competitive scene while not as big as csgo has been mostly developed by the playersmany of which have played the game for a long time these leagues dgl esl anz spread across every region of the world and have offered regional seasons tournaments draft tournaments and even world cups no matter what region you are from you can play this game ive played with guys from south america america and canada eastern and western europe from the uk to ukraine australia and new zealand etc the game does not boast tens of thousands of players but the players that play this game in the competitive scene are very dedicated it is not as hard to learn how to play as it used to be because the game has been allowed to develop and the players have figured out how to play the different maps in general if youre wondering what game type the competitive scene revolves around its a game mode with 3 points that you can capture objectives similar to that of the battlefield genre or starwars battlefront you own one they start owning one and then there is a neutral point if you cap a point you bring your whole team back you start with 5 players and they start with 5 players you fight to the death to kill the other team using all sorts of strategies and tactics but also try to potentially cap a point or bait a cap and bring the rest of your team back sounds fun as hell right its awesome game types if youre not a competitive guy there are a ton of game modes to suite your fancy here want to play fast paced with 32 people and respawns choose push want a slower paced mode much like the one i described for competitive but with 16 players instead of 10 choose firefight want a mix of push and firefight with points you can capture but also respawn waves choose skirmish there are a few others as well ambush for instance puts you on an attacking or defending side where you are forced to escort your vip a player who cannot die to one of two possible objectives these are the 4 most common game modes in that order server activity insurgency recently broke the record of an all time high in the number of players online at once no matter what time you get on to play there are always active servers to play on gameplay the gameplay is quite different from any other game its a lot like the call of duty 4 pro mod or hardcore mode you dont have any huds or ammunitionhealth bars you have your gun in front of you the time of the round the points and their status at the bottom of your screen and thats pretty much it its a source engine game a lot of former cod 4 guys and csgo players like it although its not really anything like csgo pacementalitycontinued comparison it can be pretty fast paced especially push there are people everywhere and theyre all trying to kill you other modes like firefight and ambush can be much slower paced yeah you can go for that initial kill and if youre good you might get it the other team might also be playing slowly and you might pay dearly for a risky move id say its relatively realistic enough to make it different from cod or battlefield but still arcady enough to be fun for the guys who like that aspect of games its a good balance reloading takes a little longer than your average fps but not too long sound is really huge in this game you can hear tons of things and when you run around people can hear you in the next room you dont know how many bullets are left in your mag unless youve given it at least a little attention etc the game requires a lot of mental attention if you want to do really well but also is arcady enough to where its completely in your right to mindlessly shoot virtual people at 3 am for instance you cant really mindlessly play arma or squad but cod or battlefield doesnt require quite as much mental attention its hard to be really good at csgo but for different reasons csgo is a lot about aim id say its relatively harder to be good at insurgency than it is to be good at call of duty or battlefield although prior shooter experience certainly helps the mental aspect of insurgency and attention to detail isnt really found in another shooter youll definitely get a new experience here what are you waiting for go play the game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency an indie team of gamers turned modders turned developers everything about this game was done right from the attentionengagement with the community to the sales that basically give this game away for free which in turns invites more gamers modders and free content for the game from both the community and developers i got the game for free from a friend and what attracted me the most was the modding support and the open modding community this allowed me to jump right into modding my own server out immediately under 2 years later i host the most popular coop servers in the game with a continuously growing 700 member community bottom line,1,1

222880,Insurgency,the most exciting immersive fun and lethal multiplayer fps i have ever played the battlefield if i had one word to describe the experience its tactical first if youre coming from bf34 the cod franchise or csgos forget everything youve learned about gun fights two or often one hit will kill you which means you need to use cover suppression smoke and flash to get around gun fights are tense this is partly due to the lethality of weapons but also the suppression mechanic you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head your screen blurs and if you pop your head out at the wrong time thwack and your dead maps are expertly designed consistently updated lots of variety and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer weapons have character and ive found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing unlike csgo where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon insurgency weapons perform realistically in that wherever the sights are pointed that is exactly where the bullet will go weapons still recoil but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does game modes brilliant coop is awesome multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome whats really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay you really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up what sets this game apart other than everything else is that players work together here youre not playing with the silent majority on bf4 or cod people are on their mics strategizing and celebrating the game mostly adults too well adults who yell alloha snackbar as terrorists while throwing grenades at american soldiers haha if you get this game get mic please you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone final words one of my favourite games on pc kudos to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys they obviously have a passion for what they do and its part of what makes this game great it also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer fps tps addiction socom 1 amp 2 socom source,1,1
222880,Insurgency,so i will be honest i bought this game 5 months ago after i played a few games i quit and i contacted steam to get my money back biggest mistake of my life this game is what everyone should call a war simulator after got boring played csgo and bf4 and i redownloaded insurgency i had to give it more time and i did amazing sound amazing gun models amazing gun customization amazing gameplay real gameplay when you run u cant aim u cant reload u cant strafe properly u have to be quiet quick and precise if you want to survive one bullet and you are dead i was waiting so much for a game like this i love this game and maybe its my favourite fps game ever last night it was the first time i had a dream about being in a game and insurgency made me dream of it buy it and give it some time to get used to it,1,1

222880,Insurgency,incredible game high on my list of best tactical shooters i was rather skeptical during the alpha but insurgency is one of the few games ive seen transform into a masterpiece during its early access phase i highly recommend buying this game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,after 580 hours of play should i say anything grab this great indie game this games developers are very honest and still developing this gem released at 2014 if you join a team acting as a team in pvp and coop your pleasure is 100 guaranteed in this game dont think your personal scores try to move with your team for example if youre a sniper try to find a good position and eleminate you opponents as much as you can dont try to rush objective points if youre a support try to provide covering fire on objective points while moving your team together not to try to rush objective points before your assault team finally thanks to the developers for their efforts to enhance this great game time to time and continious supports,1,1

222880,Insurgency,so many fps games and i just like oh its like that it just the same like other fps when i try insurgency and i just like this is the best fps i ever played yes i said insurgency is the best fps i ever played because for some reason you can kill enemy with just couple of bullet or maybe one bullet if you use sniperetc recoil is so damn hard you need to maintance your shot for a better accuracy kinda hard to find a good spot yes many good spotsniper spot have their own counter spot you can die without seeing who shot you so far so good i never saw a single hacker and the best part you can customize and whatever you want because insurgency have steam workshop yeah so thank you i recomended this game just to support the developer because insurgency is awesome,1,1
222880,Insurgency,if you want a tactical modern fps that takes skill teamwork and strategy get this if you want to jerk yourself off over a 200 digital knife get csgo instead,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this is the kind of game you expect to run like battlefield or call of duty but then you come back with ptsd you dont know what ive seen mom its not a phase ive died in iraq 27 times now ive spent 65 hours in the middle east dad probably one of my all time favourites 1010 would die in iraq again,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is the most realistic shooter fps i have ever played takes 1 bullet to kill someone unless they have heavy armour if they have heavy armour it takes 2 or 3 no jump packs no jetpacks 15 guns 30 maps night and day maps great gamemodes 10 classes worth every penny,1,1

222880,Insurgency,do you want to get shot cos thats how you get shot this game has been described as a cross between counterstrike and red orchestra 2 and i think that fits the arcadey pewpew of cs is absent and instead you play in a more realistic environment where your cautiousness and tactical thinking is rewarded the sense of immersion is greater than in cs and while the pace is generally slower as a result its also more intense with the stakes seeming higher you will get oneshotkilled in this game and you will oneshot kill others you know going in that this is the case that bullets are very deadly this affects the way you play and you value your life more and this in turn increases the immersion you will not find yourself as seems to happen in csgo plugging several rounds into an enemy standing right in front of you who immediately oneshotinstakills you and be left with the feeling that your death was somehow unfair the bots in coop mode waves of enemies that unlock after an objective has been achieved to protect the next objective or recapture the one just taken randomly triggered behave on the most part very realistically youll get ones that see your head as you lie prone and headshot you and youll get ones that rush past you failing to spot you waiting round a corner as well as ones who anticipate you hiding there they never feel either under or overpowered and do a good job of convincing you theyre real the only exception is their tendency to disregard fire from molotovsincendiary grenades and they will quite often simply stand in the flames and burn to death without fleeing or run straight into the fire disregarding it and die that needs fixing coop with 5 other players feels very good six player teams mean you dont feel too much individual responsibility most of the time but that can suddenly change when at the last moment as your comrades have fallen youre thrust into the role of saving the team capturing the objective and triggering their respawn against the odds this can result in an immense sense of achievement and reward when successful and unless youre playing with gradea aholes goodnatured sympathy andor hilarity when you fail communication with your team is often essential to succeed the whole game mode is very enjoyable pvp is a blast and where the comparison to red orchestra 2 is closest squads of up to 16 players although as this is a sourcebased game 12v12 is the norm fight against each other across some beautiful and realistic maps you will love the warm glow of the sun in the late afternoon as you run through the crunchy snow but you will also curse that very same sun getting in your eyes and obscuring your view of the other side of the ravine and that blasted snow for giving away your movement the feelings of oh crap oh well here goes as your squadron marches into uncertain death that games like red orchestra and planetside provoke is here albeit on a somewhat smaller scale but insurgency does it better its prettier smoother and more polished than ro2 and your value to your team is much higher than in both that and planetside and did i mention how inexpensive it is the funvalue ratio on this game is very very high if you have a few spare quid and a few friends to play this with you will have a blast with insurgency,1,1

222880,Insurgency,insurgency is a hard game and raw you probably will be able to fully appreciate only after few rounds ended disastrously and any hole in his chest too the title offers good realism of firearms a personalization system treated classes a decent graphics and sound rendition definitely noticeable cooperation with their team is a key part of this title and play to help his team rather than get a good personal result is required if youre the kind of player who prefers a quick and immediate and perhaps loves being the lone wolf of the situation then insurgency is not for you but if youre the kind of person who likes to cooperate with fellow to develop complex tactics and a type of gameplay less frenetic and more reasoned you have found a game worthy of your attentioninsurgency is a multiplayer shooter that delivers everything it promises and it does it with the weapons of the maximum realism without compromises or concessions modern take it or leave it but if you like the thrill of dying with only two bullets take it also costs little,1,1
222880,Insurgency,note please remember that this review represents the personal view of the author and is in no way an absolute truth so theres no real point in arguing in comments about anything if you disagree still if you really want to no one would stop you from doing it the author disclaims any liablity or responsibilty for any consequences of proper or improper use of this review because of my strong love for fword ill replace it with the word chainsaw credits of this idea go to jon lajoie cheers operation flashpoint rainbow six the old stuff like raven shield swat that is the kind of names that comes up in my mind when i hear the combination of words like fps tactics realism hardcore and so on unfortunately related words usually were dead genre empty multiplayer what the chainsaw theyve done to the series why couldnt they chainsawing do it just like the old times chainsawing chainsaws but things have changed for me in march 2014 when i purchased insurgency to tell the truth my hopes werent really up about this one even though i played insurgency when it was a mod back in 2008 and i really enjoyed it for ive seen too many new fresh games that looked promising and got positive reviews to turn out to be em disappointing including the sequels of series that kicked back at the time so i was pretty scepctical when i started playing my judgement wasnt clouded by so called woweffect the one you get when you start a game youve been waiting for and looking forward to but in the meantime i wasnt too sceptical and i actually even forgot that i played the mod so here i am playing insurgency trying to figure out who is who what to do and where the chainsaw im being shot at from and the more i play the harder it gets to ignore this thought screaming through my brain this is chainsawing it man they finally chainsawing did it and it actually is it the game is challenging you dont have crosshair healthbar and even ammo count on your hud only the amount of magazines o you have to elaborate some sort of feeling of how much ammo you have left in your magazinge and how bad you are hurt you can actually die from a single bullet and that makes you act carefully and steady its hard to aim because of the trembling hands effect after you sprint for some time and the suppression effect that is caused by being shot at really cool feature that is also implemented in a nice way equipment weight and resupply points that make you choose the equipment wisely you cant assemble a wunderwaffe and have it all and many other things that make this game hard complex and challenging but so damn enjoyable it really feels great when you accomplish anything in this game even a single kill and the key to success is your tactic thinking and experience and only after that come reaction time and velocity the game has multiple game modes and each of them plays a little different that adds to gameplay variety pretty much there are even coop modes against bots and that also creates more ways to play the game for example you can play it alone which i prefer sometimes the games techincal side is also in a good state ive had no technical difficulties since the very start to sum it up insurgency is challenging oldschool hardcore interesting intense rewarding and just fun ps the two things that make me love this game even more 1 the updates that often include new content features etc are free that is just amazing two thumbs up for the developers or whoever is resposible for this 2 once you start the game the first thing you see after it loads up is the main menu yes you heard me right this game has no chainsawing intros at all at first i thought it was temporary but its been like this for more than a year now this is my personal favourite and it may be even greater than the updates thing for me,1,1
222880,Insurgency,insurgency is one hell of a beast created by mixing up all the good things from other great fps title it has the realism of red orchestra rising storm that adds a great immersion and intense atmosphere the small skimrish maps akin to counter strike for a quick and fun close quarter battles great weapon customization system that reminds me to rainbow six ghost recon and battlefields class based gameplay looks unoriginal eh nah not at all insurgency do feels like a combination something in between of those game but the devs executed the ideas impressively that i can consider insurgency as an original somewhat one of a kind game that still maintain its own unique identity among an ocean of fpses nowadays gameplay 1010 immersive intense hardcore yet it still can offer a fun and enjoyable experience insurgency is one of those easy to learn hard to master game naturally insurgency itself is a very simple game the thing that youll have to learn is how the general system works weapons and attachments the different set of classes and the realism factor itself i believe youll fully understand how the game works in around an hour or even less insurgency isnt for a triggerhappy fps player patience teamwork and careful observation of your surrounding is the key here even if you already do that like walking slowly crouch peeking on corners youll find yourself in where the is the bullet come from situation first shot screen blurred second shot you started to panic third shot and youre dead in many occassion you dont even have the time to be panicked youll have an instant death another great aspect of this game is how devs design the overall system no grinding no perk just pure skill and tactic of varied game modes that actuallywellvaried a balanced class system overall insurgency is one of the most balanced and fair fps ive ever played sound 1010 i couldve put it in the gameplay section since the sound isnt just to make the game more atmospheric but the sound design is a part of the gameplay its a crucial part for a modern military fps with a flare of relism the sound must be designed to make the game not only immersive and realitic but also usable and its actually a part of the tactic yes the sound is mindblowingly fantastic i love how detailed the sounds are the sound of bullets blazing over your head hitting the wall or floor fly near your ears and when it do hit you everything become muffed the guns sounds realistic it doesnt sound too weak yet doesnt sound that powerful sound is your best friend and your greatest enemy graphic 910 insurgency is built from source engine which is in a waydated but thanks for the great level design and visual effect and of course the gameplay youll find insurgencys graphic to be a brilliant one you might think battlefield has the most realistic graphic for a fps game that might be true but battlefields graphic is just too beautiful to be realistc i find it more in the cinematic side insurgency in the other side can capture the overall atmosphere of a battlefield a battlefield is supposed to be ugly no filtering no lens flare its rough no no i dont say insurgency graphic is ugly far from it its a bit dated yes but the dated factor and the genius devs behind the game make insurgencys graphic looks truly believable conclusion 1010 immersive believeable realistic hardcore tactical yet still fun enjoyable and pretty much accesible insurgency is a perfect balance of realistc hardcore fps game with the close quarter combat fun and quick matches of a more arcadeish fps game insurgency does take inspiration from a wide range of fps game type but the devs cleverly managed to distinguish the game to something more unique that can stand at its own two feet and overall maintaining its own identity of a new kind of fps game,1,0
222880,Insurgency,when i first started this game i was skeptical but i started to enjoy removing kafir as a serbian generally i dislike kebab but i found myself muttering allahu akbar uncontrollably as i got kills eventually i accepted allah as my one true savior and accepted that jihad simulator 2014 is the most realistic jihad expierence on the market allowing me to be the muslim terrorist i always dreamed of allahu akbar brothers keep up the fight,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this game is worth more than its retail price yet i got it for free because one of the developers sent me a key now 180 hours later im still addicted to it i bought the humble jumble bundle just so i can pay back the developers in some way and gave away the key i got the devs are awesomethey are a part of the community the community is awesome too one of the most mature communities youd find in fps games these days you will truly enjoy playing and will always have a sense of fullfiment when you win because communication and coordination with teammates are required to win this game is worth more than its asking price i completely stopped playing cs go after i got this hopefully more people discover the beauty of this game tl dr awesome devs awesome community awesome game,1,1
222880,Insurgency,this game is not for the impatient or the twitch shooters who like mindlessly running and gunning down whatever moves near their randomized spawn skill is not the be all end all of this game it plays a large role but ultimately boils down to the smarter team always wins if you like first person shooters that are challenging i recommend this game it will make you an extremely efficient player in other fps shooters if you invest some time into it with 1 or 2 bullets killing you it forces you to really learn the maps for camping spots and how to properly use coverconcealment also players learn your strategy from the previous rounds so you have to be adaptable and unpredictable the developers put an emphasis on teamwork and it shows the scoring system is based more on playing the objectives and less on the kd it is also extremely rewarding if you win after a long round with evenly matched teams the workshop is one of the reasons why i really enjoy this game it is completely customizeable you can change the weapons optics reticles scope reflection colors gun sounds player skins music and even environmental details just by hitting a subscribe button for free the community is also amazing you have a ton of players making quality mods including the developers themselves posting weapons you know it will be top notch if pvp isnt your thing there is a coop setting with many fun game modes where you play against bots there are even many custom servers as for how the game runs it is very smooth even if you have a lower end rig there is very little compromise and still looks friggin awesome there are however minor bugs here and there and sometimes crashes happen but it is still a solid game one thing i noticed is that the developers did their homework with the guns and are very detail oriented you can see smoke trailing off the end of the barrel after shooting for extended periods blood splatter patterns of your teammates can indicate the direction of the shooter each mag contains the correct number of rounds after you reload no fairies sitting in your pockets recombining your ammo in this game the suppression is so intense that it scares the crap out of you the first time you pick this up changes in tone can tell you what type of grenade was thrown and the audio direction cues are spot on you can pinpoint exactly where someone is sneaking up on you based on the footsteps or gun sounds ive noticed a lot of fps shooters have sounds indicating the general direction of players and then you have to search a little to see the enemies in this game you hear them you shoot them cons 1 crashing to desktop can be a major buzzkill 2 some custom servers override your mods and can cause conflict making parts of the gun invisible until restart 3 spawn camping until you learn to avoid certain areas altogether its not fun 4 you will probably suck for a loong time in this game in the beginning 5 this game is hardcore so there is no crosshair ever or kill indicators on some of the servers so if youre used to having them youre gonna have a bad time 6 teamkillling and spam kickers can get out of hand very fast and ruin the experience sometimes 7 your character can be pretty stupid when you are trying to be sneaky behind some enemies and a teammate happens to die within your line of sight your guy might yell out they took out our squad leader getting you completely massacred cant tell you how many times ive died from the stupidity of my character announcing my presence still a great game though and i highly recommend it if you have the grit to take it on i have some friends who refuse to play this game because it was too hard for them especially on the sniper heavy pvp maps,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,one of my alltime favourite game i really enjoyed it and i spent many many hours playing this the huge amount of choices factions and playstyles the game gives you makes you want to experience every single one the story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty same engine as fallout 3 this is however beaten by an awesome gameplay modable weapons a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality dlcs i strongly recommend lonesome road because of its story and revelations,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,the wild west meets the fallout post apocalyptic world and a great game is born fallout new vegas is an open world rpg set in a post apocalyptic world where fallout 3 was set in dc this game is set the mojave desert around the ruins of old las vegas the theme throughout this game is a western one but many different factions are present each with their own unique and often hilarious style and of course there is a power stuggle between a prewar industrialist caesers legion and the new california republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it what will you do this game is filled with great characters hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through the dlc adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value but all of them are worth playing at least once the exception might be lonesome road which most people loved but i had some issues with especially with one decision it forces you to take that i felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made but old world blues may be my favourite dlc for any game ever the first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter when you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer if you are interested in modding the pc version of this game and you should be then check out my tutorials on how to do exactly that youtube video modding fallout nv ultimate edition part 1 user interfacenbsp,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,fallout new vegas pretty darn buggy when not buggy game play is brilliant unique and character dialogue is hilarious its open world lots of exploring to do huge replayablity upgradingrepairing aspect pretty much not there dlcs bring a bunch more to the game expand it even further with areas to explore and quests to do moddable i highly recommend getting the mods off nexus a few community made patches help with crashing and other obvious bugs in the game pay attention to what is contained in the modsi didnt realize one had a script that unlocked all achievements at once i fail overall i give this game a 910 even in its buggy state,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,the very first fallout game ive played ive been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes thinking of something to write but thanks to writers block im going to make this short and sweet itll run well on pretty much any computer thats not 10 years old its fun and funny if you like shooters or rpgs id recommend this if you like skyrim id suggest this if you do buy it i just suggest one thing use the manual save and only the manual save if youre comfortable using the quicksave go ahead dont try and load off a quicksave though only use it when in game dont use the autosave function its pretty unreliable but it doesnt matter everything comes down to this i shot someone in the hand with a hunting rifle he blew up 1010,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,i think this review is going to be much like my arkham city review i would say the majority of users on steam will have already purchased fallout new vegas and most will have probably even finished it so this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who dont have it or just havent played it fallout new vegas was released in october 2010 the game is set in a postapocalyptic open world environment around the areas of nevada and california you play as a courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the new vegas strip across the mojava desert during the delivery you are captured and shot dead or so they think after being recovered by a friendly robot you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land this was my first ever experience with a fallout game i had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there and of course i am on the internet and so its always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so i knew what i was getting into a huge deep time sink game play is focused around the use of your vats for guns as well melee weapons vats pauses the game so to speak and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body you have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode so once you aim you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set you can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode as you wander around the desert you will find plenty of items weapons food drink books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time this can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor as you progress through the game and get a higher reputation you unlock safe houses where you can store your items in fridges cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling one thing i was surprised about in fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as i had initially imagined i created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations and this cut down the amount of fighting i had to do by quite a bit i think it was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as i have not come across many that have like wise you can go guns blazing at all times if you want although i would hate to see how your story ends out within fallout new vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game right until the last moments in the game along the way you will pick up side quests these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed there are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable i have ever played helping ghouls escape on their great journey liberating a power plant were among my favorites but there are just so many to do and i would highly recommend that people dont just rush through the main quest in new vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content while the graphics in new vegas dont look like the graphics we have today in game they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play i played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through i was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state it looks nice you can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find the game has varying levels of difficulty you can play it on hardcore mode or just on the regular easy normal and hard modes i played on normal mode so i could see the missions story and explore the world without being too focused on minmaxing my character to be optimum at all times although once i got the option to have boone as my companion a sniper the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead as you can see from the amount of time i have put into new vegas this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see and probably in our life times you will never be bored there is always something different to do whether it be crafting potions or just playing a little blackjack at the casinos there is never a dull moment i 100 recommend fallout new vegas to anybody even if you arent a fan of rpg games new vegas will probably change your mind this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and i cannot believe i had not played it until now if you havent got new vegas get it its on sale quite regularly and if you do have new vegas but havent played it please dont wait a second longer boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game easily one of the games of our generation toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6 this is a must play if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up if you would also like to follow my reviews more easily be sure to join my group by

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,the real fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community fallout new vegas picks up where fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the western coast of the united states in a postapocalyptic world the new california republic is back as is the brotherhood and enclave or what remains of it veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise such as poseidon energy and a few characters coming from locales in fallout 1 and 2 unlike fallout 3 new vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise the brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of dogooders the enclave isnt the powerful organization it once was and super mutants arent all over the place for no reason its no surprise that the creators of fallout nv are also the minds behind fallout 1 and 2 before the studio closed and bethesda bought out the franchise the postapocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries new to this entry is the faction system whereas fallout 3 automatically made the brotherhood the good guys and you only had one choice in the ending tamper with the purifier or not new vegas lets you side with one of four factions affecting the new vegas power struggle and the ending whomever you decide to side with they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the hoover dam the faction system also carries its own subset of reputation a faction may despise you attacking you on sight or idolize you reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction andor siding with them when presented with the option when doing the mainline quests for a faction youll slowly lose karma with the others until youre attacked by them onsight whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent dont place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests whilst exploring the mojave its in your best interest to side with the ncr when presented with the option they have camps all over the map they account for at least 25 of all sidequests estimate and a potential companion and his quest requires ncr fame the only factions youll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the legion and ncr all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them most of the time itll be a question of whether or not to fuk over the legion since the quest will come from an ncr official the legion has one camp in the game the other reached through the storyline and no sidequests so always side against them dont worry theres a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the legion or ncr or both allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the legion in the main story so its a coin toss either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation which i believe or you believe the system failed since its effect outside of the main story quest arcs is nonexistant perhaps the brotherhood and followers shouldve fought more perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions shouldve been introduced forcing you to balance reputations or maybe you arent a fan of having to play through a game multiple times especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough what is clear is that the legion despite being an important faction in the game has very little representation in the game this is due to time constraints with only 18 months in development obsidian had to leave everything east of the colorado river an unexplorable area originally being legion territory theres also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains and the north eastern end of the map as well the game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors buildings you can go into as compared to fallout 3 and the mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations abandoned shacks empty areas with no interiors you dont have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere all to the games detriment i wouldve preferred more interiors with pc terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the mojave fallout 3 did exploration better more interiors and towns but fallout nv does everything else better lore story writing fallout nv is more of a fallout title than fallout 3 was and if youre a fan of the franchise youll love the care obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles if you really cant be bothered and are only interested in exploring then fallout 3 might be higher on your list whatever the case nvs short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated obsidian is to the franchise thumbs up loved it more than fo3,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,im going to rewrite my fallout new vegas review because my old one was monkey fallout new vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time and definitely my favorite postapocolyptic world its one of the best open world games available and i cant recommend it more full price or not this is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation and of all time i played over 100 hours of fnv on my ps3 before i became a pc gamer ive now put in 55 additional hours and im still not done with it im not even close to playing through the amazing mods and quests this game has there is easily over 100 hours of content without replaying any of it its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all the story of fnv starts with you getting shot in the head pretty weird start but it works it makes me interested why did i get shot who shot me why did he shoot me over spoiler deleted you find all this out over the course of the story that plays itself out greatly on top of an indepth main quest you have detailed side quests to go along with it the side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own i dont want to go on forever here but if you want comparisons the story in fnv is exponentially better than the story in fallout 3 and i enjoyed the story in fallout 3 quite a bit the combat system works in an interesting way while you do have the basic fps mechanics you also have vats which makes it work in sort of a psuedoturn based way you target certain body parts tell your guy to shoot then he does its pretty satisfying especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body pretty satisfying combat i do wish sniping was done a bit better i feel like when im trying to snipe opponents from far away vats doesnt really want to cooperate which is unfortunate pretty much my only complaint about the combat this last part isnt really about combat but it is gameplay so ill mention it here the game implements a hardcore mode which forces you to eat sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable ive never done a full hardcore playthrough but i do enjoy the mode for the most part killable companions is t though i use a mod to keep that part off this is getting really long so ill make my last point about the world this is probably the major weakness of the game if i was to point out any i dont really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way if you try to go north youre almost guarenteed to get slaughtered unless you turn god mode on mid levelabout level 15 and on you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you dont have to worry about dying the world feels good and exploration is fun but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 14 of the main quest fallout new vegas is my favorite single player fps of all time and if youve never played this gem you should pick it up immediately i promise youll love it buy at full price,1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,to review fallout 3 or new vegas is a difficult challenge not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different while seemingly similar in their mechanics both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a fallout game if you have read my review of fallout 3 then you know i consider new vegas the more refined game traits playerchoice influenced questlines the faction systems and the gray morality are important factors for what makes nv so great however its the worldbuilding that puts nv as one of the finest examples of openworld games as someone who has thought of openworld games as the death of narratives from the ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like risen obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits nv doesnt tell the greatest story nor the smartest it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the mojave one grain of sand at a time nuka cola or sunset sarsaparilla,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,gameplay is amazing writing is incredible immersion is insane the amount of choices you can make for yourself is unmatched looking at you elder scrolls kept alive and fresh by an excellent modding community get it also the dlc storylines intertwine they dont interact much but its all cohesive get it cons bugs unfinished content woes of a rushed game for example caesars legion one of the three main factions lacks as much ingame depth as the ncr much ingame depth another example being freesides outskirts of new vegas condition cut content seperated zones there is a mod series called freeside open dedicated to restoring this,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,hello if anyone has read my reviews in the past id just like to let you know that i follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game i choose to review so without further ado my fallout new vegas review if you have played any of the elder scrolls games you might be familiar of the famous rpgadventure game developers bethesda they do an amazing job at creating medieval and scifi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago i think fallout new vegas is a great game but the graphics and presentation are ugly its really not even an upgrade over fallout 3 i would call it more of a downgrade bugs are small in amount landscapes are varied the open world populated and many many towns and cities to visit including your very own vegas okay off of the specs you start out in a small town with a gun and you can get meat cleavers baseball bats plasma rifles sniper rifles a concrete club etc there are lots of choices on weapons you have so many choices of armor too you will never get bored of character customization some horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat the worst ive experienced was walking through a rundown factory killing weird creatures and invisible giants gore yes i said gore with all caps you can dismember people even when theyre laying on the ground dead you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads yes heads off of the corpses crippling aspects pretty neat although weird in some ways i shot a centaur with an incinerator flamethrower and i crippled his tongue mutant creatures giant flies scourpions and geckos etc alongside and against eachother i was walking to a town called prim and a fly got mauled by a young gecko the exploration in this game is incredible you can go through vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire repaying debts etc you can head to several different other towns drink out of toilets to regain health take down large bandit empires and kill large geckos with pool cues if you like the elder scrolls this game is fun and enjoyable 910 great game accidentally deleted my level 12 character and i hate myself for that spent 910 hours working on him i had a sword and medium armor freaked me out i guess i can restart anyways thanks for reading my review please rate if it helped also comment on what youd like to see in any other review open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,stop reading the reviews and buy it already,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,developers from fallout 2 involved in the creation yes elements of the cancelled van buren black isles fallout 3 finally brought to life yes a mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences yes yes yes for all intents and purposes fallout new vegas is the true fallout 3 and the best sequel to fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series unfortunately obsidian was stuck working with bethesdas subpar game engine and base mechanics but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up fallout 2 if youre a long time fan of the fallout series playing this will mostly make you forget about bethesdas attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over problematic automatic weapons for a big example also worth noting is that obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project the fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me lead developer je sawyers mod though i consider it a muchneeded patch is highly recommended for the best possible experience descriptionupdate notes for je sawyers mod for a good idea of what it does httpfalloutgamepediacomjsawyer,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,day 1 woke up in a doctors house found myself in sweaty underwear and was asked to sit on his couch and answer questions day 2 opened the radio the doctor gave me i think ive heard johnny guitar 500 times now day 3 radio wont turn off have now idolized johnny guitar day 46 ive been stuck in a cave for 42 days now my only company is johnny guitar day 102 succesfully developed a cult devoted to johnny guitar day 252 radio died i cant hear johnny guitars voice anymore massive withdrawals 1010 would go insane from hearing johnny guitar 1000000 times again for real doe actual review spoilers i said spoilers you curious cat game never dissapointed all the way till the end ill get back to that all of the dlc and mini quests even were all very enjoyable such a wide variety of to collect and do that you can put a solid 100 hours into one character without the addition of mods fallout is such a good game but they really took a on my chest when it comes to the ending now i know a lot of people say that oh i prefer it this way and then other people say its better this way but the ending to fallout new vegas sucked donkey mmk i had so many plans i was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending but you know what they did instead of let me do that they gave me the option to revert to a prehoover dam battle save or return to the main menu never allowing me to continue that character from the end of the game on finding out that there was no freeroam really me off regardless the game is very fun but hey at least it doesnt give you a worse ending than skyrims i suggest doing everything you want to do with the game pre end game cause you wont get to do it again enjoy the game and dont try to experiment with fisto please,1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,i am the courier after i accepted a package to deliver i found myself on my knees outside a village looking at a shallow grave a man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head telling me i had entered a game i had to lose like so many others my story would have ended in blood except i didnt my lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up sadly my name and life was gone all i knew was the face of the man and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of goodsprings i dont know who i was but i know who i am now i am the woman who will have her revenge as i stepped outside i saw the good people of goodsprings being ravaged by bandits i took up my 9mm pistol and told the leader to meet us we would give him their prisoner as they stepped out confidently i shot them all in the head the blood stained the sand red but the bandits left goodsprings alone taking some food and water and as much ammo as i could carry i took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep i eventually came to the town of primm here i met the ncr a large group of foreigners who told me what i could and couldnt do wanted to help but didnt do anything unbound by their rules i picked a rifle out from their bed and at night rescued the locals i supported the new sheriff in primms independence the ncr was only willing to watch cowards the lot of them i later came across more of them content to sit drink and complain i learned of the situation of the mojave desert and began to fix the problems they thanked me paid me took the credit and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere they had built a great statue but did no great deeds i then moved along the path following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip until i came across a town on fire outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps i killed them all and took their caps for myself strange stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt a town of the dead legionaires of caesar came to me and asked me to carry on their message all shall be equal before caesar i remembered these words when i came to novac i found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the ncr as i saved them i taught them to stand alone i met the ncr at the power station obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert i sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people i winked at my fellow coconspirators of the fellowship of the apocalypse and continued on my way at a trading post in the middle of nowhere i met veronica beautiful if eccentric she was as alone as i was in this desert she told me of the threats the mojave faced her own brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the ncr we travelled together learning of the plights of the people in the mojave as we moved along we came across the poor gathered outside new vegas the fellowship of the apocalypse agreed with my thoughts that those in power cared little for the mojave beyond resources and manpower we killed the local drug dealers killed the troublemakers wiped out the kings for creating a civil war and once peace reigned continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion as i looked upon the wealth of new vegas i saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside i found my man in his suit benny surrounded by guards he warned me off i hadnt come this far to fail however and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room alone i took my pleasure from him and with his shaving knife cut his throat in his sleep that was the first night i slept well although i needed a shower upon my awakening i discovered his secret a robot that could change the whole game to my rules not a brutal conquerer like caesar not the haughty expansionists of the ncr nor the greedy selfinterest of house no yes man provided a new way our own way my travels taught me that only in true chaos could the strong rise and lead the mojave for itself not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich that was what i told myself as i walked through the rivers of blood the white hands family was first high airs and low appetites i smiled as i cut my way through them executing them with the same gun benny tried to execute me with then the omertas typical schemers they screamed as i murdered them in their beds instead i put the power into the hands of the people the boomers remants of those before i brought their dreams to life i gave the brotherhood back to those who would see its power restored partly for my philosophy partly because veronica had been my partner through everything and i would see her dreams come true as well i then found the sierra madre a dead land with untold riches finding it ruled by the mad i killed the king of the dead for my partners sanity and the safety of the mojave and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison alone and silent i found mt big the hope for the future from the past dusty unused relics i crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot our future would be our own the past had already failed us as my past had failed me to the north i found zion a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires and despite the bleating of pacifists i forged these people into a strong ally for the mojave they like we shall be independent finally i took control of new vegas as the ncr and the legion of caesar fought we executed our coup a grand army of independence from the many i had helped came to free our land from the bear and the eagle we drove off the legion and when the ncr came for their blood prize i had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death the mojave is free and shall stay free even after i leave,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,edit caravan is definitely best mini game got shot in the head survived got in fight against people with dynamite broke all limbs apparently doctor enough to use a doctor bag stole prewar stealth technology from old school house snuck past deathclaws i forget i am a courier sometimes wandered into new vegas got stuck between ncr and fiends killed all fiends with pistol hey look an energy weapon infiltrated ncr base actually they just let me in put on some random ncr outfit took ncr monorail to vegas strip nothing suspicious played bets on blackjack tried some slot machines caps will be missed wandered into freeside got mugged by people with pool cues holstered energy rifle not visible enough went outside vegas got ambushed by random fiend found gun runners store if only i had better luck with those slots wandered some more found shack found big book of science in said shack learned me some good science for great good became scientist exit shack with hopes to enlighten wasteland with my newfound knowledge got gang banged by 6 cazadores did not survive 6cazadores would learn me science again,1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,hands down the best game ive ever played i love it more than i love my family three crippled limbs havent slept in four days no ammo left and hunted by the legion but atleast my spurs go jingle jangle jingle its a perfect rpg with a perfect amount of everything you want unlike fallout 4 you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue and the ability to make up your own story i usually end up using revolvers and repeaters since im pretty much obsessed with cowboys the amount of really good side quests is incredible some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of fallout 4 although in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in fallout 4 what about the dlcs the dlcs well they are as amazing as youd expect from obsidian honest hearts my favorite since i love the landscape of utah and the story of the burned man old world blues however made me laugh as much as i have never laughed at a game before lonesome road and dead money they are gold aswell literally the soundtrack is the best ever ive been listening to the music from day 1 since i got the game and i know the lyrics to most if not all the songs its quite surprising how you wont get tired of them also mr new vegas its impossible not to love him lt3 how about factions do they beat the brotherhood of steel or the institute hell ing yes any day any time the conflict between the ncr and ceasars legion is far more interesting and immersive than the bos vs institute thing im a bit of an ncr patriot myself heheh never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive crashes by the number glitches by the score everyday you love me less each day i love you more lets talk about mods oh lovely mods if youre getting a fallout because of the mods this is the one for you you can and should customize your game entirely using them im running 100 mods now and its not even that much the problem is getting the game to work with all of them though it can be pretty frustrating new vegas is nostalgically depressing but its surprisingly a great feeling so should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed fallout game or spend 20 bucks on the best game ever made the choice is up to you id get this game though edit 1 please vote for this game to win the test of time award obsidian deserves it,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,where do i even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game lets just start with some history fallout new vegas is the fallout 3 that should have been at least most of the elements that make their appearance in new vegas were actually of the original fallout 3 which was canceled when it was almost finished by bethesda so they could make their own 3 which wasnt as amazing as it could be in several factors and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors to say the least fallout new vegas is pretty much more of a fallout 3 than the actual bethesda fallout 3 was so calling it fallout 35 isnt doing it any justice whatsoever plus fallout 3 runs quite badly on the pc partly due to gfwl and apparently is even more crashhappy so there is that on to the actual game it is incredebly enormous in size i bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least if you just take your time and explore like me expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run the game world feels huge with way more than enough places to discover also it has a gigantic list of quests so yeah this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks evenmoreso with the ultimate edition which covers every piece of expansion pack dlc with it which ups the game length very reasonably and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the mojave wasteland but they all bring enough new instuff to the table which is also useable outside the expansion pack arenas have i mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons seriously i cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use true it is partially due to the expansion packs bringing a part of it to the table but even without it is bigger than fallout 3 and with the expansion packs it absolutely makes fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two the only thing fallout 3 has weaponwise what new vegas doesnt is the rockit launcher but that is about the only thing even if it isnt graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine gamebryo which really should be replaced nextgen and is still a bit glitchy it is still really acceptable and hey graphics arent the most important things in a game storys pretty great too it all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like bugsy siegel if he wasnt shot in the face yet and wasnt living in a postapocaliptic nevada las vegas you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit where ever he might even be to have a very stern talk with him whats more is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the mojave and new vegas and it is all your choice whos gonna come out on top by what means necessary or you just decide to take it all for yourself voice acting is pretty well too mostly just dont expect the nameless npcs to say something amazing darn hear me rambling about this game and ive probably havent even covered a small part of it in short this is a quality game the ultimate edition is where you should go for and it is really dirt cheap during event sales like 5 bucks in the summer sale and you really should pick it up for a game of this calibre it is practically theft,1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,this was my second fallout game fallout 4 was my first i have literally no nostalgic attachment to this game fallout 4 sucks this is probably the best rpg i have ever played,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,fallout new vegans is probably my favourite rpg of all time its like fallout 4 but an rpg and developed by people who know what theyre doing,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,one of the best games ive ever played my experience of the game in a nutshell speech is op trying to be a good guy is really hard when it gets near to the end of the game punching is also op when you happen to have a robotic hand if not dont even think about it vats doesnt differentiate friend from enemy so if youre using it quickly it is possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether theyve been killing each other at all there is a comedian next to one of the doors on the strip his line about not being able to get to sleep will help you pick up girls in real life side quests can be ridiculously longwinded but worth it everything you eat is irradiated so i survived on hardcore drugs alone dont try this at home kids 1010 would spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a sniper rifle again,1,1
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,are you a maker of war or peace pizza edit for those in need of a second opinion ill gladly share mine its not often we can find masterpieces like fallout new vegas and when we do we want to play every second of it search every corner search for every little moment it can provide us and this gem it does a great job at that the dialogues and voiceacting are incredible and unique see above every character you come across in the vast land of new vegas is memorable every one of them has a story to tell and its your choice if you want to listen carefully or not vanilla version has enough content to keep you interested for hours the variety of weapons is huge from ballistic fists to antimaterial rifle you wont need to worry this game has everything covered if that wasnt enough its extremely moddable story is the strongest point with multiple endings endless replayability is guaranteed and im not even mentioning the dlcs yet ive finished four times already and i will finish it again every playthrough was a different experience and it was delightful its definitely a must have even for people who doesnt enjoy rpgs like me,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,i feel like if there ever actually was a situation similar to fallout in the real world there would be this cult of fallout players desperately trying to live out the real apocalypse like it was fallout trying to convince people that bottle caps were totally a legitimate form of currency trying to carry as much pointless crud as possible wondering why everyone was calling them insane i would join this cult,1,1

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,fallout new vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation it takes the fundamentals of the classic fallout games and puts them into the fallout 3 engine giving fans of the original games a true successor developed by obsidian entertainment new vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original fallout series and whose strengths are writing and solid roleplaying mechanics and it shows the writing throughout new vegas is phenomenal and no matter what type of character you want to play the game was made with you in mind you constantly feel rewarded for your choices hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game having to get food water and sleep for a real challenge check out the mod josh sawyer lead designer made for the game it takes hardcore mode to a whole new level i also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for new vegas since it has the best dlc suite ive ever experienced each of them is brilliantly crafted expanding the story of new vegas in interesting ways furthermore the dlc is foreshadowed throughout the main game and the dlc can cause changes in the main game as well if you only get the dlc for one game make it this one i cant recommend this game enough,1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,now this this is a fallout game dont get me wrong i liked fallout 4 but i love new vegas while actual gunplay and animation is mediocre the characters world and story is what keeps this game as one of the best of the last generation and one of the best in the fallout series bethesda shouldve taken notes from obsidian but the newest installment just doesnt live up to its name compared to fallout new vegas youre not a concerned parent youre not a middle aged white protagonist and youre not looking for an oversized maggot character model that were supposed to call a child you good sirmadam are a former courier from primm a settlement in the mojave wasteland left for dead by some rich high roller wannabe you wake up in a tumbleweed settlement named goodsprings and go out to claim your revenge and shape yourself to be who you want to be and the world as you see fit while you may be the best in some aspects this game will assure you that you are not a god on earth or a wasteland deity but just a guy or girl that is just good at what heshe does in order to survive and leave an imprint on postapocalyptic america there is no 4 choice dialogue crap there is no binary form of morality in terms of how you play and impact the world nor are there any quests that are just there for grinding your story is a story and it is up to you to make the best of your time in the mojave wasteland from the beginning to the end ladies and gentlemen in the end this game brings to you an excellent story rpg mechanics characters a breathing world plenty of diversity and so much more that if you choose this over fo4 i can assure you that you are not missing on anything but rather are making the smartest decision this games needs you and when you boot it up it will not bound some of your choice with bethesdas chains but greet you with open arms and welcome you into new vegas in hopes that you will and it you will enjoy your stay,1,1

227940,Heroes & Generals,items too expensive one needs to play a long time to get one single item to gamemaker give us cheaper price to buy items or give us daily spin for money boost,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i never really made a real review it might be a long review and yes there is gonna be a tldr and no i did not get paid to make this review this is my personal review so lets start off with the history of the game,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i have paid for hundreds of games yet i have spent the most time playing this free to play game,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,alright im gonna be a defense attorney for hampg right now because it really doesnt deserve the mixed user reviews that its got anymore this review turned out way longer than i planned so a tldr would i guess be that most negative reviews are either completely wrong or unfair for not showing the good sides of the game my plea is that you ignore the negative comments most which are outdated and simply give the game a chance try it out yourself i mean it is free after all if you like it cool welcome aboard if not then so be it not the end of the world is it now to the actual review i can tell that the developers have a lot of dedication to have gone through such a huge amount of backlash and negativity from their own community because theyve been pumping out updates consistently since launch despite of that this game had many flaws last year and still has quite a few today but the developers are actually listening to the constructive criticism and are improving upon it every update which goes to show that they actually listen to the community at the least to a degree while yes the veterans and long time players have an advantage over new players its not pay2win anything in the game you can buy with free in game currency including veteranship vip kind of thing yes the game is fairly grindy the graphics as in lighting shadows and texturepacks arent on par with tripple a games and some mechanics have to be worked on but the thing is retos still adding content along with changingfixing and sometimes sadly breaking things every update the incredibly long list of negatives about this game last year has shortened by a huge amount which just goes to show that theyre actually listening and trying to make this a fun free game for everyone despite the negative reviews the game is very addicting can be a blast and has multiple customizable different classes including infantry recon tanker and pilot that along with 3 factions and a pretty large variety of guns and vehicles makes sure you can sink in lots of hours into the game so do give it a shot if youre looking for a free ww2 shooter it feels like the mixed reviews and negativity are putting off a lot of potential players which was one of the reasons i made this review in the first place heres some of the criticism that the game still gets 1 hackers in all my time playing this ive never even once met a cheater so i really have no idea where the hackers everywhere reviews are coming from my assumption is that they just get d by a skilled player and then cry about hacks 2 performance the ones complaining about load times andor performance really need to get something thats not a toaster before crying hampg really isnt very resource demanding especially compared to games like battlefield and gta i run a constant 140 fps max settings with my gtx 1060 so theres your proof that its your hardware not the game 3 the grind this ones a valid argument about the grind which someone asked in the comments and since everyone obviously doesent read comments im gonna put in my reply here the game does not require several hundred hours to unlock anything but basic equipment by the way even if it did the starter weapon is amongst best weapons at close to medium range if modded correctly so you could totally keep going with the basic and thrive while the grind was huge before it has been addressed and isnt as horrible anymore for example 50 hours of playtime as an infantryman can unlock everything in that class the game is obviously still grindy but that comes with free games and id honestly take a little bit of grind any day over pay to win thanks for reading this unnecessarily long review i guess i just couldnt stand by while people kept bashing the game there was a time when it was broken and deserved it but that time is no more and heroesampgenerals does in my opinion very much deserve a second chance,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,im a realist plain and simple you can do anything you want with this review even wipe your with it for all i care the game is free to play awesome the graphics are pretty damn good for a f2p game the game introduces all types of troops to play infantry recon paratrooper tankman fighter pilots stated in the game description the game has three factions us soviet union germany with varying guns equipment and vehicles for each side sides have their weaknesses and strengths in areasit evens out for the most part though equipment modifications ammo type trigger hairs barrels springs sights that can increase a weapons effectiveness such as accuracy damage and range tankman details there are 4 armor classes in this game light armor medium armor heavy armor tank destroyers each group has seemingly cool tanks with varying side gunner seats with mgs or even secondary cannons the mapsthe maps are incredibly huge i mean it that consist of buildings scattered along paths with a big town in the center of the map mostly the realistics of the game bullet droptravel stamina bar grenades seem a bit more realistic to me big radius weak and strong points of armor on the tanks fighter planes seem realistic he bomb dropping amp geometry for the most part it can take 13 maybe 4 rounds to drop a guy there are resources meaning that everyone has a limited supply of tanks fighter planes paraplanes and infantry lives really the game can be won either by capturing key points or lines or by destroying the enemy completely it just depends on how long the game goes for some negative reviews that i see about campers its a realistic game this isnt really a game for cod warriors running in the same direction that you previously got sniped in is the definition of insanitydoing the same thing and expecting different results its a game that requires a little bit of tactics andor even communicating with your team rambos dont get far for the reviews saying its a pay to win game everything is available to you by earning credits everything you can even buy the veteran membership with credits people can buy stuff with real money but they must unlock the items first paying for each little ribbon completion is expensive as hell this game is nowhere near pay to win for the reviews saying it takes forever to purchase things it really doesnt take forever you are paid on an hourly salarynot including getting paid for your score after the game the more you level up your soldier the higher his salary is which means more money rolling in quicker if you are looking to make credits extremely quick buy a fighter pilot learn to fly and shoot well you will be leaving with a lot of credits as your score will always be in the thousands every game 262 hours when i wrote this review i have all us type soldiers infantry with all weaps i have a paratrooper recon with fully upgraded sniper rifle most expensive class and weapon tankman with best light armor and a major level pilot that is my review do with it what you please beyond amazing game for a f2p ps if you plan on playing do your team a favor and get on the objective points to capture or defend every body counts dont slap on a red headband dont wander through the forest for the developers ideas fighter planes with tailgunner seats combat medics building windows with mg mounts maybe bipods compass hud ability for squad members to highlight areas on map for squad to see and finallyvoice communication with channels such as squad or team things that may need fixin vehicles crashing into train tracks when trying to cross them getting off motorcycle at full speed and dying thank you for this wonderful game,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,this review needs an update due to it being outdated this is a extraordinarily good world war 2 multiplayer game it has lots of potential i could see this becoming very popular if the developers retomoto would remove at least some grinding you will have to pay at least a little or play quite a lot to do away with the grinding just going to be blunt but seeing beyond this point reveals an extreme potential in the game since almost any f2p game has grinding i can forgive it for this one the developers are besides that extremely committed to heroes amp generals since the steam release they are working a lot harder to make this game better after all the more money they get from the game the more it will inspire the developers to create more amp better content they are holding devstreams weekly instead of monthly they show off great features that are coming or have arrived several great builds have already been created in the 9 months steam release and it does make a significant change for the better with each update there are 5 classes in general in it that you can switch to after gaining a certain amount of xp with your main you can then swap to that new rank or buy one individually from the store infantry tanker airforce paratrooper recon for a fee with money you earn ingame each class adds a new playing style to the game they are highly useful especially if they are skilled players amp know how to play the gameclass there is also a general class which does not participate in battles but uses tickets to send divisions to areas on the campaign map which will then create campaign battles which the normal players have to fight and this in turn will alter the course of the war there are great authentic weapons amp vehicles that further enhances the flavour the sounds however can still be improved upon though they sound better now they can still use an overhaul some maps are quite huge in comparison with other ww2 mps and some are small but they are all decently crafted amp enjoyable some character generation might not go astray but its probably not necessary for now at least i cannot wait to see what this game has in store for the future i urge you to see past the grindiness that this amp every f2p mmo has and you will learn that you like it at least give it that try it deserves it personal score 7510 best regards dukhat,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,ww2 fps where battles may drag on for 90 minutes things have changed not always necessairly for the best if i had to rate it right now id give it a solid not lit a lot of p2w features like 2 perks at once microtransactions cant go from prone to crouch no ingame voice chat three kinds of currency credits to buy weapons vehicles to repair and maintain them warfunds to buy assault teams deploy and resupply them gold to purchase anything,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,be warned this is a lengthy review if you wish to sit and read it all then i suggest you grab yourself a snack this game is a ton of fun i have had more crazy moments in this game than any other pc game in no other game do i get the same feeling then when i entice a tanker out of his tank only to kill him steal the tank and go on a rampage to turn the tide of the battle i have had many moments like that in this game however this game is not perfect and has some noticeable flaws lets start with the positives as i mentioned earlier this game can really make you feel as though you are the hero of the battle while this feeling is not necessarily consistent throughout the game when it hits there just isnt anything quite like it there is a decent amount of content in the game there are about eight guns available for the infantryman in each faction and different guns for each faction add onto that more gun mods than i care to count with multiple choices in ammunition trigger various internals sights and different skins in addition to all that you can chose to load up with various mines grenades knives and even binoculars and that is just the infantry you can also play as a tanker a fighter pilot a paratrooper or as a dedicated sniper each having additional more specialized equipment flowing from the previous point this game has some pretty diverse gameplay one minute you are holding off an enemy tank assault the next you are pushing forward to cap one of their command posts the next you are using anti air guns to shoot down the fighters harassing your allied tanks all of this from the point of a lowly infantryman not even beginning to scratch the surface of what you can do in the game the graphics while not very impressive on the technical side are aesthetically pleasing the art itself is clean and very consistent nothing in the game looks out of place there are a few issues with z fighting in a few maps but they are only noticeable in extreme topdown aerial views and not noticeable during gameplay the developers of the game are very active with the community they listen to complaints and suggestions in addition they post a fair amount of news to their site and host dev streams to show off the features they plan on adding to the game unfortunately that brings us to the negatives this game is not very friendly to new players with a mildly confusing ui no immediately apparent tutorials one does exist but you have to search for it and the possibility of entering a match with highly experienced players leads to a frustrating experience for people just starting the game once again building off the previous point the games grind can be very long there are ways you can shorten it significantly without paying a dime but they require a fair amount of research and in the end only shorten not eliminate the sizable grind note recent updates have shortened the grind i have not had the opportunity to really test ho much it was reduced additionally this game has a few very interesting bugs it certainly isnt the buggiest game i have ever played but be prepared for the occasional oddity again building off the previous point the game suffers from some performance issues unfortunately i run the game on a laptop so low framerates are to be expected but many members of the community report less than ideal frame rates on their systems note while not perfect this issue has been greatly reduced i am able to play at a reasonable level with the same hardware finally while there are what i find to be a decent amount of maps in the game many building and environment assets are copy pasted throughout them the maps themselves are fairly different they just look similar all of that said i find that the positives far outweigh the negatives this game is very enjoyable especially given the fact that it is free,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,for new players if you are looking to get into this game you need to be aware of few things 1 yes it have pay to get stuff real life money shop but you can get all of it with ingame money yeah it will take time and so on but after you get what u want it feels great as well better stuff wont make you play betteri bought scope with gold and found out that i suck with it while with iron sight im pretty good so only thing what recomend is veteran it will give you some exp boostit is if you like game 2 you will die a lot at least in begining till you learn how to play well i still die a lot but i make some enemy players die a lot too d what i meant is head shoots grenades road kill in time it may feel unfair but you will learn how to stay alive long enough to take out 2 enemy tanks with panzersnacker kill rogue sniper and steal their stuff d 3 i have heard that game have cheaters and ect but as far i can tell it have some skilled players too and by investing time in it not cash you can be one of them 4 grind yeah you can say its grind fest but which mmo isnt and i will put it simple if you like game that grind wont matter for you cose as you play you unlock stuff and as like i said better stuff wont make you betterim rank 5 infantry loving my starter g43 taking out higher rank players with their uber guns just need to play smart 5 hag is not your standard fps you run straight to enemy you die you try to be next rembo you die try to take out tank with standard grenades die so what you do is flank take cover prone run in z style use mother earth as your ally report snipers to your teammates play as team use suppres fire smoke them out with grenades etc 6 you start out with 1 loadout after a while you can customise to your playstyle found what works for you 7 game isnt for all especially not for 1014 years old cry babies or short temper ppl and impatient persons you need to take time with this one take it slowly set your goals and work hard to get them my first impression when i picked it up i didnt like it i meant i died instantly in all possible ways headshot legshot torso shot roadkill grenades and that money shop i with my friend was like its p2w you cant do without paying rlm enemy is op playing as german and german only and so on but as we played we wanted to see how the big war looks and we aimed to get on rank 5 and on the way till rank 5 some changes happen not to game to our playstyle i stopped to run straight on enemy positions stopped to stand up or still in 2v1 fights stopped to aim for most kills instead i start helping team in big picture capture objective points kill rogue snipers defend our points and so on and the more i kept playing the more i enjoyed game like now if i can get 1 good match out of 5 ones its worth it and the atmosphere of game are perfect airplanes roaming sky tanks rolling over land and me as infantry in middle of it all one can customise his character to his play style be brave be sneaky be tanker be pilot and so on rewarding unlock system what responds to your playstyle great game to play with your friends make a squad and you can team crush your opponent think your enemy have better guns kill him and pick it up to see for yourself game strongly rewards team play and tends to punish rambo wannabes nicely done progression system which will make you busy good use of repair system which wont allow to spam op equipment could be more balanced though for f2p game are well balanced u can get all what you need with ingame money what leads to point where your opponent cant have something what you cant have well it will take time but then again more you play this game more better you will become vet bonus is overpriced i need to spend 15 to get it so yeah devs should make it down on 5 cose i personally dont like to use gold its make me feel cheap only 2 tier system so after you get rank 5 game kicks you out in big pot with high skilled players what makes it feel unfair sometimes they could add tier 3 and and let tier 2 be mid ground for lvl 56 or 57 players to get around of things or something like that game isnt friendly for new players i mean if they dont get how to play it in first 10h they will leave it cause if you try to play it as regular shooter you will lick bottom forever no training grounds for tankers pilots and ect i mean i would love to see what is what before i spend shitloud of my hard earned in game cash to switch my infantrymen on different branches so that should be fixed upper point and some other design choices tend to lightly hint on more cash in then delivering most to players enjoyment and its sad for dev i got it that one needs earn money to keep supporting game and making it better but if one truly says that they have players first before cash in you should fix some things first make it separate vet buying option so one can spend 5 to get vet not 15 to get vet and leftover goldone day saw over 10k players on steam if half have a vet its already reasonable cash on month in my opinion it would be nice sub model for beta game and still would make money as well player should be able to see all clases himself in advanced training so they know what they are getting because now its buying cat in bag ps great game eager to see it expand and become better 810,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,update since adams update there are 2 ways to play fps or rts to the fps side there are 2 different types of battles staged and war staged staged battles make each side have the same resources on each side so theoretically each side has a fair chance of winning it can be different everytime but there will always be infantry p sometimes there may be medium tanks with planes or there can be light tanks with paratroopers etc you can play as any of the 3 factions any time you want but each soldier has its own equipment and level so choose wisely war after a soldier reaches rank 12 or is a general they can buy assault teams that affect the war and how it plays out while you can do this you are stuck with the faction you choose until the war is over and then you can swap playing war allows people to level up faster both by their actual level and their ribbons in exchange for this bonus xp the matches are much more unpredictable what resources you have will be dictated by the generals ats that are fighting in that area if you lose the battle that area will be taken over by the other faction if you win youll keeptakeover that area each battle is just part of a larger battlefield all across europe with over 3000 different locations to fight for or to defend the war ends when 15 major cities are taken over by a single faction how you will start most people with start with the fps side unless you buy a level 12 soldier or a general you will start playing encounter first with other new people which is a small infantry only map it only has one objective so it can be a tad bit hectic but its only to help you get used to the game and they normally last about 510 minutes once you reach level 1 then you can start playing the smaller attackdefend maps you will start to see the other types of classes in play now recons paratroopers and tanks becareful of these buggers p once you reach level 5 you will be allowed to play the larger ad maps and you will be introduced to planes also avoid these buggers xd you will also beable to play war batlles but i wouldnt advice it until you get better gear goods pay2notgrind not pay2win no one can really gain a definite advantage over you skill will still reign supreme ive seen people think they can win by paying money and see them do absolutely terrible with a mg42 xd i could kill them with a stock m1 garand variety of weapons used stg m1m2 ptdr avs36 etc different variety of maps some are more cqc and others more open infantry tanks planes paratroopers recons oh my infantry only map d everything can be bought with ingame credits this includes veteran premium membership anti tank weapons are found around the map so tanks can be destroyed even if you dont have at nades or mines higher rank of your soldier the more money he earns modable weapons since adams update theyve added a way for infantry to deal with planes with mobility d the starter rifles have receieved a massive buff that puts them as one of the best weapons in the game currently if you use the right mods bads not very welcoming for new players stuck on sa for a while tanks and planes can be a problem if you dont have the right equipment currently germany is the most populated faction with most of the vets america is mostly full of the newbs soviets is least populated but i find its an average player base ye godz the grind is great got to pay either with ingame credits or gold for the weapons you used mods ammo the weapon itself but if youre smart this cost shouldnt be much the maps can get a bit repetitive after a while but the devs have stated they have maps in development conclusion it can be overwhelming at first but stay for the long run to have the best fun its like a ww2 battlefield it encourages playing the objective and not kd like cod you earn more money and xp for cappingdefending the objective than just killing the enemy team dont listen to the negative reviews by people with only 6 hours into this game they just call bs reasons why you shouldnt play they mentions hackers but in all of my 600 hours i have yet to encounter a hacker be smart dont be a jimmy kotton reference p now to ready up my m1903 and m1 garand and kill lots of people 3 edit g build 17916 now we can have bathtubs that float in water and drive on land amphibious vehicles have been added that work on land and water 3 and the maps were remade but lets be honest you just want the cars that float d edit h build the 2 most op weapons in the game mg42 and m1m2 finally got nerfed although the mg42 nerf was a tad bit too harsh,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,this game gets way more than it deserves the devs are really good with listening to the community fixing bugs and adding content that we ask for in my perspective there are more positives than negatives with this game most of the complains are about the graphics the grind and the p2w the thing you have to remember when playing this game is that its free to play you really cant expect aaa graphics now the grind in the game is a pain i understand as the grind in the game used to be much easier but i do respect the devs choice being that if you could unlock all the items in the game there would really be no need to play when i play a game like this one if i unlokced everything quick by the week i got everything i would get bored of the game being that i am playing the matches for practically no gain i really dont know how people think this game is p2w seriously i would pay 20 for me halving the grind wall for 1 day how is that p2w also unlocking guns with gold is even worse as you have to pay for the guns before it and to add to the you gotta pay for the ribbon xp to upgrade the gun to make it any good,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i sold my xbox one lack of content you only have the choice between 2 or 3 triple a to enjoy this kind of unique game screw you xbox one i wont miss you edited for a useless free badge after 900hours killing amp trolling nazis with their own overpowered weapons that you can easily amp freely pick up on their warm filthy dead bodies is the best feeling you can get in this free to play so definitly not a pay to win dont get fooled by all those unfounded steam reviews although the game has its flaws people are just too salty when theyre out of their comfort zone cough cough cs wayoverhyped go cough cough heroes amp generals best free to troll did i mention i have a lot of fun for free,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,ive been with the games community since fall of 2014 so i know stuff mkay while i rarely play the steam version personal preference for the most part i do like my browser edition ive got several hundred hours ingame alone clocked under my belt and what must be thousands on the forums heroes and generals is a game that seems to get a lot of hate for reasons that i cannot seem to actually find in my hours of play some common misconceptions the game is pay 2 win no its not if you definition of pay 2 win is a game that essentially makes you pay to get the better content or has a paywall of some sort then hampg should be fine for you all content that affects gameplay is available for free users and while the game has a bit of a grind its nothing impossible one piece of advice though plan ahead know what you want on what soldier because trying everything out on your first guy will result in one soldier with a lot of stuff who can only use one set of stuff per match make a new soldier for each playstyle you want to have access to ingame newbies are underpowered or some variation at first you have an unmodified semiauto rifle and the boots on your feet your rifle can be one of the most potent weapons in the game and with skill and the right upgrades you can turn your lowly m1 garandsvt40gewehr 43 into an efficent killing machine the game has a steep skill curve youll be up against 4 year vets but not at first for several hours youll be up against people who have roughly the same time as you just take heed as soon as you buy a weapon that has the gold matchmaking group tag or you enter the gold matchmaking group via the player ranking system you will run into players who have been playing for months years possibly since the game started and yes at first youll get roflstomped and then you wont you should learn watch people of a higher rank see how they move etc hell even ask them questions if theyre in the deploy queue fe the game is hard no purpose sugarcoating it however its nowhere as terrible as some of these keyboard warriors with lt10 hours make it out to be frankly a lot of them sound like entitled little rats but whatever if you like the game play it if you dont think its the game for you then take your business elsewhere but give hampg the chance it deserves its a damn good game even if it has its quirks here and there i strongly encourage anybody who has the time to check it out its the least you could do,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,pros you can be tanker to blow infantry with tank you can be infantry to blow tank with anti tank mines and airplane with antiair gun you can be pilot to blow the out with plane you can be parathroper to capture enemy camp you can be sniper to blow infantry head if you are accurate enough to aim camos or skin in this game really help you to blending with the environtment you need play this game with headset it will help you to hear enemy footstep and you can set ambush for them the devs add update for grinding system and make more easier for newbie to get credits cons repetitive gameplay all you do is just capture enemy camp with time limit many people says this game pay to win but for me is pay to progress this game all about grinding so i do not recomend people play it if not patient enough to grind credit for buying weapontanksvehicle at least every month you need buy veteran membership to help earning credit and earning exp ranks fasterltlike monthly subcription but you can play without it too but it will take you long enough to earn credit and reach higher rank lol,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,free to play the weapons are almost balance large maps update weapons high costs explosives defender won 95 maps after hallowes update the only thing you can see is plant tank driver class is only good income,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,pheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew i have waited a long time to write this review heroes and generals is the best made game i have ever played but the most poorley made game i have ever played you start up the game pick a faction russia the one everybody loves germany the one everybody hates and the allies the other one when you first start playing it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing and you generally have a good time then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like with smgs semi auto rifles bolt action rifles and good stuff like that also you die super fast and dont expect to have health regen if you get hurt the game will not help you out so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently or inconveniently around the map same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or antitank weapons but you will die trust me you will and you will spawn back in at the other side of the map hahahahaha yes you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die i suggest that you invest in your factions truck early on speaking of vehicles the gameplay with them is crazy fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics but they have one other type of vehicle tanks oh dear lord tanks where do i even begin okay i can do this you will have ptsd after playing for the first time with tanks they are op as balls and make you die and respawn but we already covered that if you dont take the game seriousley as i often just mess around they can add some fun to the game but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it oh and planes are the same thing except you cant destroy them nearley as easily as you can with tanks then i bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game now i will tank i mean talk about the largest issue with the game the grind after the first set of vehicles and weapons tier ii weapons all cost way too much you cant make the money that you need because of another system i will talk about later because of the low amount of maps to play on there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons you cant even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you dont have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it i will give you an example say i am playing as the allies i want the thompson smg a ka bar knife and some stick grenades i have the m1 garand and i level up my infantry assault ribon to level 4 to get the grease gun smg and some pinaple grenades now i buy a shovel because i need to get to level 5 in close combat to unlock the knife i use the smg but then im not using the grenades so i cant level up in explosives i switch to grenades but then im not using my shovel so im not leveling up close combat i use my shovel but then im not using my smg i pick up the smg that the enemy i just killed dropped and use that but then im not getting xp in my grease gun so i can upgrade it so it goes in a terrible circle i do like one system in the game beleive it or not the weapon upgrade system if you use a weapon of your faction a lot you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it like springs sights barrels and some cosmetic things like skins i like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most for instance i like the m1 garand a lot i first used it as a sniper weapon changing the ammo getting better gas sealing and even a scope but then i changed it to a closequarters weapon taking off the scope lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire there is a downside to this system however the games repair system ho mama every bullet you fire every vehicle you spawn every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag it costs money lots of it i kind of like the system as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own also you guessed it upgrades cost money between matches so the game also punishes you for using them which is a little strange here are my suggestions to make this game better 1 add more weapons so skill trees dont only unlock you one or two weapons 2 lower the prices on everything the game grinds on for way to long 3 add more maps the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast 4balance your damn tanks 5place spawn points much closer to the action okay my opinion of this game i like this game and want it to be good but it is constantley held back from all these problems and i know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff but that is no excuse for what we have now they should have waited much longer on releasing this game as i am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks but one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play as of now my final rating for heroes and generals is a 710 i will continue to update this review as the game progresses that will be added to the bottem of the review,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,heroes and generals is a game with reviews that dont tell the actual story while it take 10k to get a scope there are zero items or skins in the game you have to spend irl money on this game is not for fps players its for rpg players its got wow speed progression and there is literally a score bar for everything this game is not pay to win it is however an enjoyable experience that i dont have enough hours to truely give a good review but i can say its a definite pickup if not a keeper,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,dont read all the bad reviews just try it out the game just fully released of course there may be a longer wait time than usual it was promoted on steam ya know there has been so much negativity towards this game and while some of the points are valid its still a very fun game to play the longest queue time i have had is maybe 5 minutes and i have rarely ever waited that long i usually get in a game within 30 seconds the grinding really isnt bad you dont want to just have all the guns unlocked for you from the start you want to be able to work for one as you play youll get better with the guns you use and when you finally do unlock the other guns youll have that sense of accomplishment sure its not a perfect game but what really is compare it to a big name game like call of duty they arent flawless and always need tweaks after release games can only improve with time this game is free how many games have you paid 4060 for that you stop playing after a month and were far from good this is free it is free its going to have its flaws but if you look at the bigger picture it is a very solid game sure its not for everyone but man im having so much fun with it of course its no aaa game but that isnt why you play it please just give it a try and have your own opinion i saw it when all the recent reviews were negative about a month ago and still tried it out i love it not going to stop playing anytime soon,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,most of the other reviews are either complaints of the horrible choices they made for the game most of thats fixed now atleast the other half is someone is better then me so they must be hacking so many hackusations just try it out for yourself its a free game what do you have to lose,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,if youre looking for a positive review then youre in the wrong place however if youre here for a tremendous chicken stir fry recipe then look no further serves 4 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook 325 calories serving healthy ingredients 1 orange zested and juiced 2tbsp soy sauce 2tbsp sesame oil 250g 8oz tender stem broccoli 5cm 2in piece root ginger 1tbsp sunflower oil 1 garlic clove finely sliced 1 red pepper deseeded and thinly sliced 150g straight to wok noodles 400g 13oz chicken fillet cut into thin slices method step 1 mix together the orange zest and juice soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside step 2 blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes then drain well and set aside step 3 finely shred the ginger then heat a large frying pan or wok add the sunflower oil heat it until sizzling and fry the ginger till its crisp step 4 when its done remove with a slotted spoon add the chicken and garlic and stirfry until just browned remove the meat using a slotted spoon and set aside step 5 add the red pepper and broccoli and stirfry for around 23 minutes until its just tender add the soy sauce mixture bring it to the boil then return the chicken to the pan and heat through serve with noodles,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,this is a good ww2 game where you can be infantry tanker paratrooper pilot recon and a general its free to play which is really good i think its worth getting it to try out you do have to level up which can take a while but it is fun and you can buy soldiers instead of leveling up the game is still being made but its really good the support staff at the company are really friendly and helpful but some people have had a bad experience with support the problems with the game are that the server sometimes goes down the game is a bit unbalanced and the game doesnt always make sense,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,by recommended i mean meh bob the builder couldnt fix this game if he wanted to go play verdun or red orchestra 2 theyre way better,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,one of the greatest wwll game on steam takes some time to grind but if you have a will it wont take that long to have what you want you can play as infantry paratrooper tank commander pilot reconnaisance general and more you can be american german soviet and more new nationalities going to be added soon keep up the good work retomoto 1010,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,many people call hampg a grindfest and thats really hard to answer hampg has no end tier equipment so its a constant grind you can recruit more and more soldiers to get your dream loadout theres no end theres no best weapon theres no best career theres no best tank theres no best camouflage you choose what youd like to own you cant have it all unless you deside to own another soldier another weapon another tank although owning one is more than enough people also confuse hampg to be p2w heroes and generals is not p2w its pay25buckstoskip5hoursofgrind and theres not a single item exclusive to p2w players unlike wot and wt which debunks the this is p2whas paywalls arguement unless you really think that paying 25 bucks to skip 5 hours is a serius advantage as for the gameplay its fun amp addicting which is exactly why paying in hampg is more of a way to support reto than skip a few hours of playing however i do admit the optimazition on this game is,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,few bulletpoints why i recommend this game over many other onlinemultiplayergames with the current offerings alongside why i for one have nicknamed this game as my ideal battlefieldgame with its current offerings alone to some extends i personally consider many of the features here to be the modern minimumstandarts vehicles are playercharacter bound and are spawn with them so there is no need to rush to airfield pads or other spawnpoints as no one is able to hog the vehicles to themselves aside maybe perhaps just simply wasting the resourcetickets vehicles yes even planes can be still stolen hijacked however so its not recommended to leave them unguarded especially the tanksoh yes the tank gifting is rampant in this game server datacenterside hitdetection and all shots have physics ie no hitscanweapons replaysystem though only usable by the hampgsupportteam at the moment for cheatertrackingevidences and other development feedbacks eg finding hotdeathzones of the maps regionfree so everyone can play with everyone in theory singlequeuesystem even if you can only queue with a singlecharacter at the moment the battleservercenter is decided by the majority of the players in the match worth noting that there is no traditional masterserver to choose the battles from but every match is setup with the matchmaker aside for warmatches from which you can manually queue for specific battles yes this necessarily isnt the most clan esportsfriendly game in regards that setting up competitive battles against each other is for the most part pure luck everything except the gold itself in form of warbonds is available with ingamecredits silver worth noting though that first completed match pers day gmt0 also gives 4goldcoins at the moment there also has been a lot vouchercodes given away by the developers alongside some events to boost the goldincome temporarily eg instead of 4 you got 10goldcoins for example all in all a quite hasslefree ww2firstpersonshootergame with a extra strategypart to setup semicustombattles in a 3waywar on the map of europe at first new players might get overwhelmed especially with the loadoutcustomization possibilities eg training a specialized antitankinfantry but eventually once starting to reach the higher ranks with better salaries to purchase more new characters and equipments for them things get a lot more smoother oh and of course almost forgot about this bicycles bicycles everywhere provided of course you know where to find them sometimes theyre right next to a spawnpoints sometimes you walk about 1020seconds to them those who complain about having to walk everywhere just either dont bother studying the maps or are even outright ignoring bicycles to begin with both things sadly are were evident in warbattles elitemode,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,so after playing this game for over 800 hours i thought it would be thime to write a review so here it is good game thanks for reading it 3,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,i see big majority of bad reviews are coming from players who played a game for 13 hrs i have played this game for a long time it did not use to be on steam i played it since it came out the game started of pretty good but when they added it to steam they kinda messed some stuff up but around 12 months ago the game started getting better dont listen to those people that say that you have to grind enternity to get some good stuff i havent payed for anything and i have everything you can imagine from recon with camo and one shot kill sniper to a us paratrooper with a m1 carbine also tanks cars smg recon and this is one of the best ww2 games i ever played it might not be the best but it sure does not deserve this much negativity towards it and to all who say this is a pay to win nothing good comes for free you cant expect to just get in the game and level up like in cod either pay like you did to buy your cod duh or work to get the thing you want,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i have unlocked every soldier type and every weapon for german nation you might think that this was boring and worthless but this game gave me so much fun many ways to create your fighting type soldier not that hard grindleveling large variety of weaponry pay to progress faster you have to unlock first sth to buy it then for golden money or boost up progressing with it as f2p youll get it sooner or later large maps some bugs there are also funny ones slight advantages in some weapons that can be prevented with tactics strange fog weak german tank destroyers maybe i suck with them p overall i recommend this game like no other big thumb up oh and people complaining about crappy first weapon in gold group most of the time i levelled up my soldiers using g43 killing with ease all types of soldiers just use your eyes to aim,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,its tiny at 16gb its a return to games of the late 90s and early noughties such as savage its not perfect and its not a sim by any means but it looks sounds and plays wonderfully for a game that demands so little of your system it does feel a little freemium but like ea offering battlefield unlock packs i think the pull to simply not indulge in premium packs for solely your own gain is enough to hold off if i bought anything for this game it would be to reward the developers who i am so impressed with i look forward to exploring more of it though as im still somewhat a newb and the free to play aspect of it means i should be able to do this so look forward to killing me lots on the battlefield d,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,to be more powerful you have to spend alot time in it the game offers large variety of weapons modifications and vehicles this game is more realistic than most other games but like all games there is always space for improvement i hope that more maps other game modes and more weaponsperks can be added to further enhance the experience of the game,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i didnt really like the game when i first played it but it grew on me now im really enjoying it i dont really understand why the reviews are mixed im usually pretty harsh on games but this one gets a recommendation from me its free to play so what do you have to lose besides your time,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,good free game it is a really cool free game that you can play if you have a computerthat can handle it i dont think its too big probably fun to play with friends,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,good for waste entire your lifetime,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,hate it but its fun d,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,its buggy sometimes but its still good,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,for a free game this is really good decent graphics and good gameplay make this a fantastic game the only downside is the time you have to wait to get into a game,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,i love this game because you can play as a infantry man or a tanker or a paratrooper and when you get rank 12 you can unlock assault teams and take part in war with your assault teamsthats just the start of this game theres much more you can do,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,amazing game edit now that this game has been released after years in beta i still think its great the weapon and vehicle selections are massive the maps are massive playerbase is getting massiveer and the number of glitches continues to shrink i think this game is ready to compete with other big fps games quite immersive,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,not a bad game pretty repedative and not nearly as good as a aaa title but its free and you can have some good times kill die respawn repeat lots of upgrades to be had a few vehicles to use including one kick bicycle and also its around a 15gb download definitely give this one a go,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,this is a wwii fps combined with rts generals side it is free to play and if you dont mind grinding to get better equipment and you like wwii then this is the game for you now firstly let me tell you that it is an unfinished game its still an early access game so do not expect things to be perfect because they are not the game does not yet seem fully optimized and a lot of players can experience lag or very low frame rate in certain situations while playing heroes and generals so be warned ok that been said the game is very fun to play but the grind is long and hard to progress but i feel its worth it if you enjoy this type of game and the era it is set in if you do decide to play heroes and generals it will be a big learning curve on the forums because there if not a huge amount of game instructions that go into detail so you learn as you play right so now you know what your letting yourself in forso let me say that spending 15 on this game will enhance your play and fun 10 fold so have a good look at the game and expect to spend money if you want to progress at any reasonable rate and have more fun doing it otherwise i hope you like to grind and grind hard the devs show their faces now and again which is nice and patches seem to be coming out at a steady pace but servers do go down quite often due to updates and teething problems when you start to play the game is played on a partially set out worldwide map and each town and city as to be fought over at the moment you have to choose between american soldier or german soldiers once you have chosen your side you cannot change until the war is over between them on the generals map so to win the war one team as to take a set amount of cities throughout the world when the war is over you can then change sides if you wish when you start to play you can buy multiple soldiers and equip them with different weapons and you can the change fron soldier to soldier while in a match to suit the battle that you are in the battles that you fight start off in training matches that quite balanced for the learners amongst us but later on after rank 3 they in are equiped by the genrals on the map they may put tanks against infantry so as in real life not all battles are equal and you have to use your whitts and team work to win all in all this game is the most fun ever and its free to play and is a must for wwii fans but it can be very frustrating due to the game not been as good as it could be because its still an early access game but imo its worth giving this game a try,1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,a really fun game to play with friends and mess around on and if your a serious player you will have to play hundreds of hours to start making so progress i think the you should be able to get more things without grinding 15 minute 1 hour games to get things but eh what can you do,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,most of the gameplay is usually a good way to come up with teamwork based tactics about what the enemy will be doing its also fun for a game night i would recommended it to at least most of my friends if i could thanks for the game,1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,great game the large maps add tons of room for strategy and the gunplay is more than good enough to keep you interested the game can be a bit of a grind without investing a bit of cash but honestly that makes it so much sweeter when you finally save up enough coins to buy the next gun or scope that youve been focussed on getting the team play and skill reliant combat have created more battlefeel moments for me than nearly any other game other than battlefield go figure and considering its free you might as well give it a try highly reccomended especially if you have a friend or two willing to jump in with you 1010 ign,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,do you like tanks do you like planes do you like ww2 games because this is one of the best free online games on steam taking place in a ww2 setting you can join the american side the russian side or the german side with your choice you are subject to diverse weapons vehicles and character personalization of that country there is an advancement system of ranks which is achieved when you gain experience from battle fight in large maps to aid your country in the war or fight in a skirmish map for practice and less experience gain heroes and generals is unique with its scenery an the maps created are greatly designed for the action that ensues i myself thoroughly enjoy this game and always come back to it again and again playing it to enjoy the thrill of my team all charging in with vehicles and on foot heroes and generals deffinitley deserves a better rating,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,the game is the best modern wwii game out on the market and the best thing is its free however the game sometimes can be frustrating so as long as you take some time off the game is fun,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,this game does need some changes but over all best game if you like a good grind that doesnt realy feel too grindy,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,needs some work on hits and misses but otherwise very fun multiplayer fps game where you pilot airplanes drive tanks and ride trucks,1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,this game is really cool but it is really difficult to jump in and learn how to play well it has a steep learning curve update 92616 ive been playing the official release now and i have to say that the game has vastly improved its a grinding game for sure but to me its equal parts frustrating as well as refreshing i personally hate playing games where i can level up and get better equipment faster than i can learn how to play and strategize properly so with hampg i really enjoy that aspect i wish however that wait times werent so long and that you were thrown into games about to start instead of battles currently in progress i want to be able to start a game from its beginning to its end not come in randomly to a random game the wait times to get into battles though is really long you wait five minutes or so and get to play a short battle which isnt really that fun though i will add that it depends what battle type you choose some of them are designed to be shorter than others the game can be a little bit buggy and getting around corners can sometimes cause lag or loss of vision but otherwise this is such a great game i love it now and i loved it when i first downloaded it as a wwii history enthusiast i find this game very addictive if you like history and fps this game is an excellent combination of both,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,you know what its aight,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i have been playing this game for about half a year perhaps a bit more and i have to say i absolutely love it you could argue that it has alot of grinding to get anywhere its unbalanced because the enemy gets more tanks or weapons than you but it wouldnt be as much fun if it didnt have these sort of things happen you may think im crazy saying this but think of it this way you buy this game for 40 play it for a few hours unlock every gun and class and then you stop playing it because there is nothing new to unlock its just gets boring and old would you rather it get boring in a few hours or would you rather have the thrill of dashing past panthers in a jeep planting british stickys on a panther dashing for the point and holding it down until the last moment to get tons of exp theres also tons of classes to choose from tankers planes recon infantry and even infantry can unlock different vheicles halftracks in the new update upcoming ww2 style trucks that can hold lots of infantry jeeps all terrain snow vheicles if you get bored of sniping you can just switch to infantry again and have some fun with the ole ptrd or perhaps become a tanker and blow the snot out of infantry with he shells until of course they slap some stickies on you p i think this is a great game but dont expect it to be a quick shoot for 1 hour and leave,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,though its free its amazing d,1,1
227940,Heroes & Generals,i aboslutely love this game i almost have 1k hours in it just because its so awesome i cant get enough of it new updates are added every month they add a lot of stuff thats really cool,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,overall i reccomend this game but if you are not willing to go through the intense learning curve in the beginning and you do not wish to grind then do not bother with this game in the beginning well it depends on the user some people tell me they had good match making with people of equal skill and some are paired with people who have 50 hours in to the game pros the gameplay is done well for the most part will elaborate soon the idea of starting as a infantry soldier and then moving on to a pilot recon paratrooper or tank crewman later on for a new experience and things to learn is a good move graphics are reasonable cons matchmaking can be very unfair especially at first a lot of grinding is needed to get any new gun or tank etc spawn camping is a issue teamkillinggreiefing is occasionally a issue not much to complain about progression can feel slow the repair system with a decked out gun can we extensive edit stupid bugs that are easy to fix i have experience in coding new spawn system is unfair bad spawns easier to spawn camp as a recon return to battle not implemented when not near obj just its buggy will get it when im a recon doing the obj as a recon this disabled your gun till you get back in the combat zone people in this game are toxic and dont know what theyre doing even at higher lvls edit overall this game is ok if you are willing to accept its numerous flaws if you go in and play with the flow and just let things happen it can be entertaining but i wouldnt reccomend this to anyone who isnt willing to accept the bads on this game especially if you are more of a hardcore gamer but if you dont get your head wrapped in the flaws and just play the game it can be fun to around with friends and play on a moderatelyserious level,1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,overall i reccomend this game but if you are not willing to go through the intense learning curve in the beginning and you do not wish to grind then do not bother with this game in the beginning well it depends on the user some people tell me they had good match making with people of equal skill and some are paired with people who have 50 hours in to the game pros the gameplay is done well for the most part will elaborate soon the idea of starting as a infantry soldier and then moving on to a pilot recon paratrooper or tank crewman later on for a new experience and things to learn is a good move graphics are reasonable cons matchmaking can be very unfair especially at first a lot of grinding is needed to get any new gun or tank etc spawn camping is a issue teamkillinggreiefing is occasionally a issue not much to complain about progression can feel slow the repair system with a decked out gun can we extensive edit stupid bugs that are easy to fix i have experience in coding new spawn system is unfair bad spawns easier to spawn camp as a recon return to battle not implemented when not near obj just its buggy will get it when im a recon doing the obj as a recon this disabled your gun till you get back in the combat zone people in this game are toxic and dont know what theyre doing even at higher lvls edit overall this game is ok if you are willing to accept its numerous flaws if you go in and play with the flow and just let things happen it can be entertaining but i wouldnt reccomend this to anyone who isnt willing to accept the bads on this game especially if you are more of a hardcore gamer but if you dont get your head wrapped in the flaws and just play the game it can be fun to around with friends and play on a moderatelyserious level,1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,i played combat arms since 2008 since i started playing heroes amp generals i havent even logged on to ca this game is the best war game ive ever played i love this game if youve never played this game you need to check it out you will love it my hat goes off to the guys that make this possible the detail is awesome i wish i could play this game 247 but i have to work during the week thats how much i love this game look how many hours ive racked up and so fast ive only been playing this game a few months play heroes amp generals youll be glad you did look on youtube for videos that will teach you about the game amp also check the forums there is also a channel on team speak 3 there you can join a clan and get to know some people who have played the game a long time and know the ins and outs of the game you will learn a lot from these guys i hope this review will help have a good one,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,really fun game with a massive amount of potential my only problem with the game is that it takes hours upon hours of gameplay to unlock mid teir and high teir stuff when in reality it should take at most 2 that will make the game feel less farmy but anyways if you read this devs please either make items cheaper or give us like a daily money roll or spin for some credits or simpily reduce prices a bit,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,amazing game i love fps games i play bf on console and counter strike on pc so thought i would get this game since its free jumping into the game i found it very well balanced i was with low levels from the start and was top fragging on most game modes so i think the other revies which state you get spawned killed must be older reviews as the games i have just played we have all had the same weapon from the get go coming from cs i can honestly say this community is fantastic i posted a quick hi new to the game on the forum asking for guides to help me get started and everyone was very helpfull i love the way the progression works and it is something i am used to playing other fps games now my only quibble with this game is the upgrades which cost irl money i liked this game so much after only playing a few hours i had a look at the upgrades to support the devs bearing in mind i have never ever payed any money at all for a f2p game however i was dissapointed by the upgrade cost i do think the cost of gold and the 30 day membership is quit steep imo bearing in mind this is totally optional its a shame as i would have bought say a 1 time pass but paying monthly or every 3 months is just not for me and working out at about 6 pounds a month is expensive imo if there was an option for a permant upgrade i would glady pay around 20 gbp and be happy about that sadly i wont be upgrading due to the cost game wise the game is brilliant i have sen a few other reviews with peopel complaining about getting insta killed etc however i can only presume these people are not used to fps games headshots or are running on potatoe pc so they are at a disadvantage all in all i would give this game 810 the whistling and sounds are amazing and for a f2p game i would much rather play this than a bf game which is saying a lot considering how mmuch time i have played bf for great game give it a download if your a fps lover you will love this game dont worry about the start menu it looks slightly complicated but you will understand it very quickly as long as your not a total idiot p,1,0
227940,Heroes & Generals,the game has huge potential but iit still needs massive upgrades polishing and stuff hope it will get better soon playing it alone may be not so fun the best way to play it its in a squad with friends it gets super fun i wish good luck to the developers,1,0

230410,Warframe,this story requires a bit of setup last year a friend of mine whom id known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder called a grandmaster ingame called warframe a third person cooperative shooter with elements of phantasy star onlinediablo loot runs procedurally generated levels and more content being added all the time the game was difficult to start as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers running along walls sliding down ziplines soon i was completely hooked my friend and i were playing late into the night trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon or trying to beat our best time on the survival missions where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down over the year there were many great victories hair raising last second escapes and new friends joining our little group many hours were spent joking around with each other on skype cracking jokes blasting weird songs at each other and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases flash forward a year warframe now has space combat new warframes new weapons and new combat controls the game still has its original style but its so much improved last week our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions the only thing that made us stop was getting tired on tuesday my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didnt show up that night i found out on wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition the shock of it is still hitting us hard the friendships that we had formed through the game gone in an instant it hardly feels real i keep expecting him to log in and be there ready to do another defense mission and its difficult to accept that well be going it alone now we contacted digital extremes the company that makes the game and asked if there was anything we could do they dedicated their 11202014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air their reactions were heartfelt and touching they really do listen to and react to the community i not only recommend the game for how much fun it is i recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat up to four per session your gameplay experience may vary alone and form a clan or join one just because many items are clanonly i recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community they constantly improve it and add new content items and weapons there is a storyline that is unfolding the voice acting is delightful you could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of warframes and weapons you can own or buying things that you cant wait for thanks digital extremes and rest in peace woxit,1,1
230410,Warframe,okay after 3k hours gameplay i can write really good review ill try to make it as short as possible with basic things you have to know 1 really amazing gameplay amazing characters weapon mechanics etc you wont see it anywhere else 2 updates hotfix new content once per weekmonth max new events new quests short but really cool 3 community say to russian suka and he will reply to you with sadboys people are friendly talkative and pretty competitive if you ask a person to use specific warframeweapon he will agree instead of fighting you that he wants to pick something useless 4 greatest developement i havent seen so much care for a simple game like never devs are always checking for bug reports and always fixing them they make live streams and discussing their next moves make events with platina igname currency and working hard with community 5 so far this is the best freetoplay not pay to play game you are not forced to buy anything like anything you can trade with players for platina you can craft any ingame weapon without donating you can purchase any skin without donating the only purpose of buying platina is rushing stuff if ure lazy to wait crafting process 1272h or buy slots ltltlt which yet u can once again trade with ppl for platina and use it in slots so the game is about farming and using your time if you cant afford it and calling this game expensive then you are simply stupid i have donated 25 amount in whole playtime but not cause i missed something because i wanted to support this amazing game thanks for reading and i hope this 5 points review will punch your to start this great game ps if you need help with missions or youre loooking for clan feel free to add me in steam or ingame aliases cptnnvbs,1,1
230410,Warframe,there are very few games that have held my attention for 1000 hours over the years this is one of them i created an account back when the game was still in alpha late 2012 back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from even then though it showed promise over time they have added tons of content new warframes weapons galore new planets mission types archwing fly in space events clan dojos and foundry player to player trading system syndicates to join player hubs relay stations pvp 8 player raid etc etc if you enjoy third person shooters 4 player coop pvp raiding rpgs andor ninjas in space lol this game is a dream come true then for you being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out the game is a constant work in progress and the developer digital extremes de is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframesweapons combinations to see which ones fit your style the best believe me the game encourages you to do so it is surprising the amount of variety in the game when you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time also decent customization for your warframes weapons sentinels companion kubrows dog companion liset your ship with a multitude of color choices skins and attachments every warframe has its own set of individual abilities they all have a total of 4 some are better at being tanky dps sneaking cloaking solo play healers aoe damage defense etc there is a warframe for every situation it seems you can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies for example continuity mod allows for longer power duration time when you ability is activated more ammo damage mods etc etc sooooo many making building your perfect warframeweapons very flexible and enjoyable you have the opportunity to have a primary secondary and melee weapon with the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods especially made for them that being said the game can be very grindy especially for newer players that is to be expected though being that it is an mmoish experience especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items well worth it though if you have the time to invest sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and fix it nerfunnerf is the nature of free to play mmo ish kind of games constant balance tweaking this is not an instant gratification game either the game gets better the more you play it you can also purchase items with real money from the in game market it is not necessary though most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly except of course vanity items skins unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game de sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox valentines day halloween st patricks day etc free weapons too they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year the developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that which is always a plus the game can also get repetitive at times but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen you just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game all in all the future looks bright for this game a developer that actually listens to community feedback constant updateshotfixes plus there is so much new content coming soon game is not perfect of course but what game truly is right there is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game definitely sets itself apart from the competition mmos are hard to review but at its current state i give this game a 4 stars out of 5,1,1

230410,Warframe,before you read into this review let me ask you one question do you think fun is the most important thing in any game if you answered yes stick around and keep reading if you answered no you probably wouldnt like warframe warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative but i personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture warframe is not about a deep gripping narrartive or memorable characters its about action fun and pretty crazy weapon variety and to top it all off everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free warframe is a very specialized game focused on action flare and fun and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun with over a dozen unique warframespowersuits used by the player each with their own unique abilities and stats to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as and then theres the weapons oh boy the weapons this game has almost every kind of scifi weapon i can think of we have small scale particle cannons beefy sniper rifles plasma casters living weapons that shoot everything from electricity to streams of deadly viruses an insanely powerful rocket launcher a grenade launcher with remote detonation powerful bows a gun that shoots spinning saw blades and of course the obligatory pewpew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience oh but thats just the primaries in every mission you will have the option to carry a primary a secondary and a melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please the secondaries include but are not limited to living weapons that shoot corrosive darts and poison gas a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor 2 deadly hand cannons one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts miniature plasma casters rapid fire dual pistols a spreadrocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls deadly and accurate burst fire pistols pocket snipers revolvers a lever action beast throwing knives throwing stars and a standard semiauto pistol to ease new players in and then theres my favorite weapon class the melee weve got greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword theres also the polearms heavy axes heavy hammers rocket hammer and even the thrown melee weapons useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills more recently digital extremes added in 2 katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like wolverine melee has become much more prominent lately now that de has completely revamped it no longer do you simply mash or hold e now you can perform different combos that require different inputs these combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon each melee weapon class i mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod and each mod comes with its own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations my favorites are the katanas with decisive judgement as the stance i use it to make my tenno look and fight like vergil from devil may cry 3 so yes warframe can seem repetative to some people but not to me i greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me and i truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative that said i thoroughly recommend warframe to anyone who likes shooters or character action games or anyone who likes having fun,1,0

230410,Warframe,warframe in its simplest parts is a amalgamation of mass effect 3 shooting old school diablo looting hoarding free running parkour and freaking space ninjas did i say space ninjas its really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target if you ever wanted to be bruce lee this is your game it has boss fights with actual strategies plenty of unlocks to find lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere the new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about but is as easy as paper rock scissors in its simplest form weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle alternative playstyles such as stealth plays a prominent role in warframe you can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows you can choose between support frames offensive frames and defensive frames for a mission invite your buddies or grab some guys gals from the recruiting social channel if you want to meet new people join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space you have multiple saved loadout slots for free digital extremes doesnt really nickle and dime you in this game like other f2p games they do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items xp boosters warframe slots weapon slots and materials for those too busy to go fight nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them they give away the best guns for free during those events they have a xp system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the xp necessary to unlock the sickest weapons this is a play to win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient but you can just play more and get it isnt playing the game the purpose of it of course you can buy completed warframes for real money but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it at less than 1 a slot no subscription fee and no initial game purchase this sounds like the steal of the century and you dont have to buy them and still have fun but its nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort in short play this now,1,1
230410,Warframe,space ninjas i shouldnt have to say anything more fair warning if youre not willing to spend a long time playing this game youll find your options kind of limited you start with 2 character slots 6 weapon slots and 50 plat 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots youll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots as everything else is a waste getting more plat costs money and i highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat log into the game every day and wait for the 75 discount to show up with the discount a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you dont care about having all the weapons if you want to collect all the weapons youll probably want to spend 50 and go for the 3000 plat option the mod grind collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons can take a stinking long time to work through but if you can have fun doing it after all it just means playing the game a lot youll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at good mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets but everyones usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked id say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content it can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe class you wanted a week ago and still havent reached playing with friends is recommended,1,1

230410,Warframe,there is only one thing you need to know about warframe its free oh maybe i didnt make myself clear enough when i say that warframe is free i mean literally speaking it is free still not clear enough alright ill elaborate apart from two different types of items appearance items such as skins and coloring pallets and weaponwarframe slots it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone in this manner it is possible for you to obtain every warframes characters or so to speak every weapons every nonvisualbased items and the likes of course there are conditions to fulfill and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time isnt this what you are looking for but the point is it is perfectly possible to play warframe in the long run without paying a single cent its your choice so what is warframe in this game you are basically a character known as tenno who fights battles within a futuristic solar system you will be teaming up with 3 other tennos this is a 4 player coop game to complete missions laid out by lotus a female commander issuing you orders nah she is nicer than your exgirlfriend so dont worry about that you will basically be facing three separate forces grineer corpus and the infestation think of the three races in starcraft if you want to get a better idea there are different types of missions ranging from elimination rescue spy to defense and rescue as for weapons basically you get to equip a primary weapon rifle shotgun sniper and many others that are hard to categorize a secondary weapon categorization is hard for this as well and a melee weapon sword mace fist you know the deal as for your character you will be using one out of the somewhat 10ish slightly less than 20 though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by warframes each warframe comes with different stats such as selfrepairing shields like those in halo health energy mana and speed still more importantly each warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills these skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy one thing to note is that gender is preset so those transsexuals dont have to fake their gender anymore which is well you decide if its good or not there are also mods modifications that you can insert into your weapons and warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are oh and there are parkour learn how to press wasd lshift lctrl space in fluid coordination it will be helpful and painful but you will definitely need them simple unlike many coop shooters warframe definitely has its merits one of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most mmos you can level up both your weapons and warframes to a maximum rank of 30 moreover you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful in this way warframe wont be a simple runshootkill seescore gosleep type of game never there are things more important than that another merit of warframe is that there are frequent updates when i say frequent i mean frequent as in one big update per month or so there will be new game modes warframes weapons mods etc i mean come on who thinks that l4d2 came too fast after l4d1 is released i do who is still waiting for l4d3 after all these years i am who thinks that gabe newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of valve games i do come on we have been waiting for l4d3 and portal 3 and hl3 and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting this wont happen for warframe though the game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating you get new contents every now and then and they usually blends well with the game usually still like most games there are pros and cons of warframe and i have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games one major shortcoming i wont say flaw of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line apart from some trivial storytelling there really arent much of a tale going on there are stories told im not saying there arent but they are rather weak i know that is not their aim and that is not really the point of warframe but compared to the rich though monotonous storyline of l4d and portal warframe needs to good a better job here also the game can be rather repetitive you know this applies for most coop shooters so there really isnt much to say about this yeah repetitive so in general try warframe its free if you dont like it drop it simple as that if you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run like how i felt after my first 100th hours do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and warframe slots i bought like 1990 usd worth of platinums not much but it is the spirit that counts right,1,0
230410,Warframe,itll give you back your virginity,1,1
230410,Warframe,after 2365 hours i can confidently say its ok i guess but ill just play it a bit more to be sure,1,1
230410,Warframe,my god i have not had this much fun since i discovered tf2 warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam theres a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff which imo is what makes this game so good i was always a sucker for thirdperson shooters and this might as well be my favorite the gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from something i really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play you can be be at the sidelines of the battle assisting your team and picking off targets you can mess with your opponent lining them up for a perfect slash dash you can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective or you can all the ninja and come from the front guns blazing also melee play is an actual and reliable choice the controls are laughably easy to get into after an hour i was completely used to it and now with the new update 14 there is an new and better intro to the game it might take a while to discover what this does how that works what happens when i do this etc but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki i would give it a 810 has yet to disappoint me,1,1
230410,Warframe,i hate grinding as much as the next guy but theres just something soothing about it in this game,1,1
230410,Warframe,01112016 edit2 added new edit2 and removed all grind 10042015 edit this is a good spaceninjas sandbox thirdperson shooter 10012015 well many information that i wrote are out of date and im too lazy to edit my review right now 06212015 edit made some changes and fixed some grammatical errors so im playing this game for more than 3 years and i want to write this this game has great graphics but with single graphics you cant make a good game but it can for some people edit2 actually graphics are quite gorgeous for f2p game so this game have a great choice of weapons but 50 of them feels the same but most of them actually useful with highlevel enemies edit they adding a more and more fun and actually useful weapons now edit 2 nevermind like 90 of weapons are viable on all levels and this game have a lot of enemies but all of them feels the same and doing the same tactics nearly only things that change with them are weapon models and protection types flesh cloned flesh robotic or ferrite armor etc all enemies dies the same in your daily slaughter edit but they adding new miniboss type enemies such as grineer manics corpus bursa and infested juggernaut edit2 welcome new modular corpus enemies such as scrumbus and comba diversity of tilesets and they all beatiful and atmospheric but it doesnt really profitable to play on 60 of tilesets because some of them dark sectors have bigger resource chance and more xp and orokin void which have prime parts and more xp for example are more profitable archwing its nice to fly in open space and shotmelee every enemy who flies near you but right now its just barebones nothing more interesting in it than few extermination sabotages and interception missions and all of the archwing and their specific weapons are hard to get edit they added archwing mobile defense and defense gamemodes and first archwing boss jordan golem pretty cool actually kubrow you can got and rise your own doglike loyal companion but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30 per day they losts it like 20 per their dead and their health drops about 10 per day you need to buy refills dna stabilizers 6 things per 75000 credits which refill only 40 per use and to find a egg you need to spend about 2200 runs depends of random and your luck to get one so in point of view they are just creditsink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge and sentinels dont require credits to take care of them and dont lose loyalty after death edit a new breed of doge that pickups items for you edit2 new incubator upgrade segment makes owning kubrows much easier kubrow will lose only 5 per day and it automatically places kubrow into stasis if he on verge of death this game have great variety of warframes and their awesome abilities and most of them have many differences in abilities and different stats and cool looks edit2 every frame is unique and you cant really compare them except if you want something specific this game have a nice amount of bosses one boss per planet but most of them are bulletspongy and boring for example you need to wait until they become vulnerable or you need to shot into specific hitpoint to kill them example councilor vay hek general sargas ruk lephantis or mutalist alad v and some of them closed behind keys to get frame which drops from them vay hekhydroid no longer needs a key lephantisnekros mutalist alad vmesa edit2 you obtain some frames from fun quests others through dojo lab research and there are some with specific ways to earn their parts ivara drops only through spy missiontype and etc in this game you can get every weaponframe without paying platinum ingame currency you need to buy with reallife money but still you can get it through ingame trade with people but you need to craft them yourself blueprint costs credits ingame currency you get through doing missions some blueprints requires research from clan dojo s laboratories which requires credits and resources too and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft them resources you can get through missions from killing enemies cool variety of mods for warframes and weapons which drops from enemies and you can make you weaponframe more powerfull with them but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies and some mods are very very close to be useless intruder 6 seconds for hacking maxed rifle aptitude 15 status chance maxed but even so this game is very good and i had a good fun with it im recommending it try to play it with friends and kill things together i dont have much friends though developers support this game with weekly updates and hotfixes in which they fixing bugs glitches and adding some new changes or items edit2 also devstreams nearly every 23 weeks with news about new updates and answering questions from players 9510 this game still grows and becomes more interesting with time i hope on this games release developers will get rid of all disadvantages in it this is best f2p game on steam i dont count valves tf2 and dota 2 cause they turned into the crap imo in my opinion,1,1

230410,Warframe,warframes relaxed take on third person combat impressive visuals and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair all of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone you assume the role of one of the tenno an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing waryour character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate they soon attract attention awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias lotus the tennos intentions continue to remain unknown warframes third person combat is simple but refined providing a very relaxed and smooth shootemup feel while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay enemies will drop many modifications during missions which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation this design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the games rpg elements each of the weapons have their own specific function attack patterns and style which further compliment your playstyle dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instantkill included to increase difficulty it often feels unjustified and overly punishing mission maps are generated randomly based on preexisting tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen each mission has a specific objective however many of these feel overly similar often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them however this soon branches off into many directions though many of these use the same tilesets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path the matchmaking system can be frustrating offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress offering no options besides public or private you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times the matchmaking system definitely needs work and its constantly overlooked throughout updates warframes free to play model uses microtransactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials with free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content warframe shows how the free to play model doesnt have to alienate nonpaying users while warframe doesnt provide the adrenaline fueled action were accustomed to in shooters its shootemup style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition the heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times especially when farming for a specific item bugs can be prominent at times especially the ones that affect the user interface however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team pros stunning visuals especially for more powerful video cards plenty of weapons and characters to level up customization allows any type of design and playstyle which adds replay value frequent content updates cons dying can feel unfair at times leaving the player stunlocked until death matchmaking system needs work often selecting poor hosts high repetition within missions high system requirements microtransactions are a little overpriced while rough around the edges at times most bugs and technical issues are not persistent as long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isnt a limitation theres no reason not to give warframe a try with its fair free to play model if you enjoyed this review please check out the analog reviews steam group where we strive to provide honest and unbiased reviews httpsteamcommunitycomgroupsanalogreviewsofficial,1,0
230410,Warframe,at around 1300 hours into the game i finally entered character creation,1,0
230410,Warframe,youre looking at a player who has logged in a beefy amount of hours after playing some hours i am sure that you will be hoofed on into this game as well so let me write this review to mootivate you to start playing pros beautiful graphics active gameplay endless content a broad range of customization over 100 200 300 ways to kill something f2p amazing questines gets better as new ones are added space cats space dogs cons a lot of farming and repetition like any mmo very limited for a low rankstarting player but its pretty easy to rank up the first few somewhat forced to buy platinum at some point but platium is tradable among players rng rng rng lovely rng no space cows the only major downside to this game is the farming and repetition unless you dont mind doing so overall this is a great game to satisfy your inner space ninja needs tips gtbuying platinum is quite expensive but 20 50 and 75 discounts can be offered by daily login reward or you can just buy prime access which includes a shiny prime warframe and discounted platinum that will last you quite awhile gti recall the game will award you 50 nontradable platinum upon reaching some mastery rank i would highly recommened buying weapon and warframe slots with that im going to continue updating pros and cons as the game continues to grow,1,1
230410,Warframe,warframe is a great game with a few issues surrounding it the pros in my opinion are you never feel pressured to buy platinum since trading is easy and so is getting credits each frame character that ive owned have all felt unique and pleasurable to play the game looks gorgeous hands down its use of lighting and such make it look fantastic the missions while repetitive at times are enjoyable especially if you have a friend with you there is a great variety of frames weapons and mods to challenge yourself to learn coop is easy and lagfree as far as what ive experienced the cons are the game can bug out at times missions can be slightly repetitive as said before some players may just stand around doing nothing or be bad at the game in summary pick this game up if you have a few friends with it and become a ninja today,1,1
230410,Warframe,this game is historically correct ninjas started as farmers but soon became ninjas to fight off the samurai so ninjas farm and warframe is about ninjas you can figure out the rest,1,1
230410,Warframe,it takes a casual to play one hundred hours a dedicated fan to play for five hundred and an absoulute madman to play above 1000 hours as you can see i have completely lost any sanity or will to quit this game is slow to start but with friends cocaine and a spare 148 billion years you too can become just like me and any other insane person that has put in more than 1000 but to reach the golden 2000 hours that is godhood seriously though its a good game with some rather baffling choices from the devs but hey if you can put that aside and dont mind grinding for a few hours this is the game for you however you can and will get lost in the early stages at some point bring an experienced friend or even guides to help you if things get rough but dont blindly follow guides my best experiences in this game were finding them and messing around with builds makes this game so worth it at least to me one more thing to those wondering should this ever reach the top of the boards yes there are microtransactions and yes there is paid currency but you can work for every thing in this game everything course the grind is more challenging and the road of the grind will be longer than the lifespan of the universe but you can still work for it there is a more sinister outlook towards the future of this game so please before it heads down video game dev hell play it its free and it pretty fun,1,1
230410,Warframe,watched this game grow from the ground up intense grind fun gameplay well optimized great graphics not new player friendly despite their best efforts decent trade soloable but heavily reliant on the trade system diverse gameplay everimproving lategame and story quarterly events offering exclusive weapons and mod sets friendly community but mostly unorganized game play power creep is real in this one ever expanding gameplay and mission types very indepth modding system for all weapons frames and companions and yes companions are legit in wf good dev team with weekly streams on upcoming ocntent and fixes the mastery systemprofile rank is like most a staus symbol and gate by leveling weapons waframes and companions you gain xp towards your profile ranks granting additional daily trades and unlocking quests weapons and frames when reaching certain milestones its also the biggest cause of burnout in the gamethe vast majoirty of the best weapons in the game are unlocked very early on while most of the weapon gated by later mastery ranks are flat out terrible however ranking these is required to increase you profile rank its at this point that the game becomes very stagnant for most as the progression is no longer fun and feels more like work its created a community within the community that solely relies on loot caves and leeching xp from other players to bypass the leveing playing process aside form that top f2p ive ever played hours played if you dont live for the grind this one probably isnt for you as a whole 810,1,1
230410,Warframe,an excellent example of f2p game done right pros nice graphics dynamic and engaging gameplay unique visual style and story good coop pve experience nonintrusive and balanced monetization excellent devs communication and feedback game is constantly developing and new features become available regularly cons the gameplay becomes grindy over time pvp is almost nonexistent so i higly recommend this game if you are into coop pve thirdperson shooters its a kind of game when if you get tired of it you can always take a break return at some later point and see a lot of new and interesting stuff added with the latest updates,1,1
230410,Warframe,big edits this is long and it is only getting longer with the edits ive been making i repeat myself constantly because many only read the things they dont like and then comment about things i have addressed this review is for new and old players i say i cant recommend it but there are many positives about the game if you are dedicated to trying it out you will need to invest a good amount of time to get to a competitive point this is not a game you can just pick up it is hard for beginners let me preface this by saying i love this game and i will always hope it gets back to being all about the players in its current state i cannot recommend it ive played this game since beta release i am a grand master founder and have put a ton of time into it many of my friends and clan mates are still active and i usually play with them for social reasons at night de has beat this game into the ground it used to be great it was always grindy but it was a delight to play through all the content throughout warframes lifespan de has had a ton of over the top dreams and incredible ideas when archwing was announced everyone was super excitedthen it was released it was half and has not been fixed since nerfs any veteran player and even some newer players could talk about nerfs all day de scott loves his nerfs he has lost sight of what used to make this game unbelievably fun de steve and de scott dont take the devstreams seriously and constantly shoot down fixes and brilliant ideas from players i honestly dont think most of these guys play their own game if scott actually took a character off godmode for one damned minute and tried some endgame with his nerfs the game would immediately get fixed what these guys need to do is set aside one solid week a month and just play their game they dont get a whole lot done anyway this would at least give them some insight into what needs to be fixed de has some serious add issues when it comes to fixes they bounce around so much that nothing actually gets done grindfarm these guys talk constantly about reducing grind but then the next update comes out and there are grind walls and waitpay gates everywhere i understand completely that this is a free to play game there are right ways a wrong ways to go about it though and theyve chosen the absolute worst way to do it edit the grind has been seriously reduced not only that but its a lot less monotonous and miserable to do so the recent big changes in the void system have only really made it necessary to grind for relics void keys not only that but the void is now a planet and the traces are run on regular missions now you can do what my friends and i call killing four birds with one stone grind farming is still a thing but being able to farm four things at once is a huge step forward grindwallpaygates by grindwallpaygate im talking about complete stoppage of progress due to a wait gate which can be paid to reduce this is what the foundry is 12 hours for weapons 12 hours for some materials for weapons 12 hours for pieces of warframes 72 hours for frames that means its at the very least 84 hours to finish a warframe in the foundry without buying it some weapons need anywhere from five to ten pieces that take 12 hours to build they are farmable in a way but its random nitain extract is needed for just about everything nowadays and waiting for random alerts is ridiculous it is not purchasable either i get on the game after the family goes to sleep and ill maybe get one a night when some pieces need ten to build and one frame in particular takes something like 1520 this is bad game design it kills me to say that i would not recommend it i love this game but i hate where it is and where it is going edit if you can stand endless farming and grinding then i would say go for it still not changing this from not recommended though as grinding and farming are two huge turnoffs to many players i can only handle it because i used to spend a lot more time doing so and this is nothing like it used to be the art is spectacular the graphics are amazing the combat could use a bit of work but it is fluid and is remarkably funfor a little while the grind walls for gear are downright criminal though if you plan of having fun just get the frames you want and dont even worry about mastery rank this type of grinding kills the fun of the game edit see earlier void relics have seriously reduced the grindwall for gear highly suggest farming for relics with friends so drop chances are that much better im sorry de ive continued to defend you guys for years ive spent a lot of time and money on your game but youre bleeding it dry youre bleeding your players dry you are killing the game that was once so beloved by your playerbase until you guys start caring about your game again you will continue to lose the people that so strongly supported you for so long edit many of the recent changes show that de may have the players in mind in some aspects i continue to play because of the amount of time invested into the game and due to the fact that my friends still play i will keep an eye out for player focused changes and let you guys know as soon as i know edit do not misunderstand me when i say i cannot recommend it i am heavily invested into this game and i cant bring myself to completely give it up i still enjoy playing with friends many of them are still active players and i mainly play to be social the game is very fluid but it gets old quick if youre in the market for a ftp game then give it a shot but the grindwalls will eat at you constantly they have done a few things to combat this and they need to make their money somehow but for every grindwall they reduce they add two more if you have friends that play go for it if you are going to be playing with randoms i wouldnt suggest it the community is fairly toxic,-1,1
230410,Warframe,previously i did not understand this game it seemed to me that this is another p2w how wrong i was shes great at all except with bugs excellent gameplay dynamic battles very large branch up2 character too good for a free game,1,1
230410,Warframe,what time do i wake up to play warframe tenno clock,1,0
230410,Warframe,a great example of what a f2p game should be pros great visuals really well optimised a lot of content crafting system you can get everything in game without paying with real money constantly updated a lot of different ways to play the game can be really fun well balanced you can get the premium currency via trading in game neutral requires a lot of your time cons really grindy you have to wait a lot of time for things to craft for example to craft a warframe you need to craft all of its parts which takes 12 hours an then 72 hours to actually craft the warframe itself,1,1
230410,Warframe,still 1 of games that i still play for many years gunshooting checked super power checked melee weapon checked various armor checked customize skill amp passive ability checked customize color amp style appearance checked hardcore mode checked coop win freind checked f2p not p2w checked,1,1
230410,Warframe,nominated as the test of time award you can always come back to this game they keep adding new content and extending the storyline,1,1
230410,Warframe,the best f2p game ive ever come across a fair bit buggy but thats to be expected the amount of contentupdates that are constantly added to the game are insane to give an example if you were to compare what warframe is now to what it was back in 2013 youd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense theres so much to cover that i cannot fit it all into one review but lets start with the fundamentals the only other shooter ive played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what warframe allows would be resident evil 6 this games combat system is that deep im not talking about things like mods or attribute values im talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have in default mode the shooting mechanics are pretty straightforward but the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode the game reveals its mechanical complexity with melee now your primary means of attack youre able to empower attacks blockparry do combos through the use of stance mods the game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of devil may cry than an traditional shooter delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash and with most stance mods having at least 5 combo chains in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated stance mods the skill ceiling is significantly increased beyond that are your movement options you can do a sliding slash both on the ground and midair you can run on and scalehang from walls dodge in any direction and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump the basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of mods mods are items that fit into weapons and warframes alike to help improve and tailor the players chosen combat style every item has 10 mod slots and 1 stance or aura slot each mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect it it through this system that allows warframe to appeal to virtually any type of players preferred approach to combat customization is a large part of warframe whether aesthetic or statwise youre even able to choose your own ship though such a choice is purely for show customize the interior of it along with your frames weapons etc better yet most warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding this however brings us to some of the cons that warframe can rely on a bit too much at times the game is very grindheavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blueprint to its benefit there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them furthermore the game is exceptionally optimized and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 4550 on a midrange computer i had an gtx 660 as reference another problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy one of the worst ive heard of so far is the inital archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in directx 11 mode there are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game certain cosmetic items and even warframes are sometimes only purchasable with platinum which requires that players spend real money or tradesell ingame items to other players for platinum if one does not wish to spend real money storywise the game explains very little to the player up front and uses codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala dark souls with multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the tenno themselves there is a lot of world building content for players to go through overall though its an amazing and unique f2p game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon if ever 82 out of 10,1,1
230410,Warframe,note if you dislike the review please feel free to leave why having put a good bit of time into it i thought id finally review warframe im not gonna do a stupid i jumped off a wall at a million miles an hour 910 or spun midair became a rocket 1110 bull those arent reviews and they arent useful so who am i im a hunter grade founder roughly 1k hours says 18k wf in game says about 1k i blame leaving it up while i sleep for the alerts p and i started playing in u7 so ive pretty much seen it all wf went from a game where they had cool ideas about what they wanted to do to a bunch of half baked never quite finished or polished ideas that eventually just seem abandoned ie the revamp of damagearmour and weapons archwing or void tower missions void missions were meant to be hard and for the elite and have amazing loot according to desteve before they were implemented but in reality they are very easy and just another place to run a million missions hoping for the 1 drop chance for the item you want as i see it now pros art team sound animation graphics ie is amazing no sarcasm not p2w is it pay for convience or pay to skip yes to a fault imo considering the prices are stupid but everything can be earned in game even if it takes a stupidly long time and that time doesnt corrospond to how good whatever the item you wanted is staminamovement has been reworked no longer do you run like a ninja who has asthma and both their left lung just collapsed and their right lung and just had both their legs broken in a tragic zorencoptering incident cons massive massive grind and time walls sometimes at the same time some grind is good some waiting is ok done properly it enhances a game wonderfully making that epic item so much sweeter and cool wf however uses it in place of real content p2p connection no one likes lag and wf rakes in cash servers should be a priority for wf weapons are kinda meh all the weapons of a given type feel the same ie all bows feel the same all snipers feel the same down to the rof by that i mean they all just have slightly altered stats none feel like they have recoil or a worry about accuracy or take more than point and click in the general direction what im trying to say is that a lot of weapons imo just dont feel like they should compared to a lot of other shooters plat is incredibly ing expensive ie weapon is around 10 roughly and a new frame is roughly 20 iirc assuming you dont want to do the farming for them to make it worse theres no rhyme or reason to their pricing a garbage weapon might be more expensive than a better weapon for no reason along with no way to try before you buy anything and contrary to what some people will say no just because you like something does not automatically make it good viable or top tier enemies are stupid the only difficulty there is for enemies is how many they throw at you and how high their armorhpshields and damage are theres no attempt here not even say to make the trash mobs stand by the heavy enemies who either give buffs have bigger guns and use special abilities ie projecting a shield farming is either survival interception or defense missions everything else is either a ghost node levelarea generally balance doesnt really exist outside of a general nebulous concept this doesnt sound like a problem but balance is the lifeblood of any game im not talking about one or two slightly op weapons im talking everything is whacked clan tech weapons very expensive to craft weapons are mostly worse than what you can find in the markets for way cheaper roughly 13 fewer mats in some cases worse there are mods that have been around for a year roughly and are just as useless as the day they were created for example warm coat is a mod that reduces shield reduction on missions that have the completely random ice effect halving your shields besides the obvious flaw of not knowing when youll enter an ice mission youll get better results from simply using a shields mod of the same cost as warm coat no endgame stuff sure theres raids but thats just another place for them to add grind walls in place of real content youll do some massive farming but at the end of the day it was all for naught unless you wanna run hour long survivals or high wave interceptiondefenses once you get a weapon decently modded any skill requirement goess out the window content is sparse and often trapped behind massive grind or time walls to stretch it out problem with that is that its stretched nearly to the breaking point content comes down to grinding weaponsframes to level 30 formaing them aka prestige to make them slightly better and repeat fusing mods to make them better and stronger assuming you can find the ing ones you want in the first place new players have it extremely rough they start off with garbage versions of mods unknowingly and the planets they unlock generally have the same mats or atleast not enough different mats which makes crafting anything very hard early on unless a new player has an older player helping them theyre sol and the one thing that was supposed to help new players the codex doesnt you need to spend time unlocking it to learn enemy weaknesses and what drops from them making it even tougher for new players to learn about their enemies oh and to scan the enemies that costs credits for a consumable inb4 but theres a wiki the info should be in game easily accesible lore what they have is great and really sets up a unique universe the problem is that they dont have almost any anywhere prime frames in their codex entry have a tidbit normally just an short few paragraphs as do some of the other codex entries and tsd which adds a good bit about the tenno this isnt so much of a con as they need more lore which would be fantastic rushing inherently nothing is wrong with rushing but as a new player getting put with the more experienced players who just rush missions mean youre getting left behind and missing vauable loot for a new player as the mission ends early because people got to the extraction zone and started a 60 second timer to end the mission communication this is their biggest fault their streams are a mess desteve or descott usually being the cause i feel sorry for derebecca trying to control their lazy attitude towards the stream treating it as a place to drink beer instead of answering question the community asks and avoidsdodges questions with half answers or jackassery to rarely straight up insulting people mild insults at best however and flatout telling them theyre wrong despite everything saying theyre not ie armor in d10 scalled up to a 95 reduction pretty quickly and every weapon that did not ignore armor was pretty useless desteve was against reworking this even though all but 45 weapons were considered useless also going along with this theyre notoriously poor at including all changes in the patch notes bugs i expect some hell everyone does but de either seems to do zero testing or so little that people are unable to log onto the servers at all more than once as in a 100 fail rate for everyone not just a server overload or something so either theyre not doing enough in house testing or theyre letting things get changed at the last moment before a patch rolls out conclusion i had high hopes for this game and de pretty much crushed them if you like grinding korean mmo style go for it otherwise stick with something better like evolve stage 2 or overwatch or almost anything elseoverall as the game is now i cannot recommend it as no matter how much things change the more they stay the same,-1,1

230410,Warframe,i used to recommend this game like a lot and i wish i could still continue to recommend this game i really really do i love almost everything about it from its gameplay to its lore to its graphics to its sounds even its customization is better than almost any game ive ever seen i do not easily get addicted to a game but this game managed it when i first came across it you can see my proof of that by just looking at how many hours ive put into it but warframe has been steadily slipping into a downwards spiral a spiral of extreme grinding dont get me wrong it gets plenty of content too and that content is pretty good most of the time a good example of this was an update called the second dream which brought with it a quest and a fitting soundtrack that were both truly epic but despite all that warframes grind problem is overshadowing all of that content it got some bandaid fixes here and there over its lifespan but overall it has been steadily getting worse and worse and now its gotten to the point where i really cant enjoy the game anymore warframe as a whole just feels like a giant chore now now thats partially because im a veteran and ive got not much left to farm for but this is mostly because of the extreme grind it just forces you through if you want to get anything in this game there are other issues like enemies tending to be nothing more than bullet sponges and annoyances and the tradingrecruiting channels being nothing more than tedious walls of text but all of them fall into the minor category compared to the grinding problem weapons warframes prime items special items event items at least 80 of the games real content is locked behind time walls wait walls pay walls and especially rng and grind walls now i could totally understand this to some degree but warframe has crossed that degree and then some with drop chances that rarely reach above 5 and most missions being very lengthy and tedious you have to grind so very much it just becomes ridiculous this is even worse for new players who have to grind everything from scratch not only that but there is so little in warframe in terms of tutorials and information that new players and sometimes even veteran players will often find themselves overwhelmed and confused no im very sorry de but i can no longer recommend warframe in its current state it wastes an unforgivable amount of a players time on mindnumbing and monotonous grinding and it ruins the rest of the game something really has to change drastically in order for me to change my rating and start playing this wonderful game seriously again tldr pros great visuals great sounds and music great gameplay supreme customization free to play has one of the better communities out there good lore cons enemies tend to be nothing more than bullet sponges andor annoyances trade and recruiting channels are nothing but tedious walls of text overpriced market items trading prices and platinum prices developers seem to mostly forget about some old content and balance issues like for example archwing in favor of constantly pumping out new content a lack of ingame tutorials and information to the point where youll find yourself frequently relying on the warframe wiki and other external sources connectivity and lag issues can become quite common and theres no such thing as dedicated servers the grind is real dear god is it real its the main reason i cant recommend this game,-1,1

230410,Warframe,its so sad watching my favorite game of all time being ruined by its own dev team instead of letting players to have more freedom in advancing to higher lvl de pumps out nerfs after nerfs removing game components and the only thing they keep on adding are countless of useless items with slightly different stat from eachother so people think they have a choice de used to be nice and friendly but then became so greedy and distant while all these new players keep pouring in and buying platinums de isnt ever going to change i cant even try to make a point anymore any discussion criticize the game on the forum alway get bomboarded with negative and toxic responses then get flagged i tried not to hate it i tried to keep on playing but one by one everybody in my shadow clan quit saying its just not fun anymore so now its just me here all alone i doubt this review would make any impact at all just 1 less player in hundred of thousand nevertheless thank you for 700 hours of fun good bye warframe,-1,1
230410,Warframe,havent played enough to give a thorough review edit 090716 to all the people whining about spectres of the rail what exactly did they take away from veterans we have to actually compleat the rails like everyone else oh no boohoo i have to experience this new system how they intended it to be experienced while having all the benefits of having every node already unlocked seriously suck it up guys this update has brought to the game something it direly needed clarity enough that anyone new wont have to look at the old starmap and vomit kavats are pretty amazing they have a very vast array of utility abilities and will be replacing my carrier rip void fissures are a pretty nice way of allowing players to gain void rewards by playing a mission while having added challenge to get greater rewards think about it like a smaller mission inside another mission whats that veterans lost all their keys yeah but now we have i have 500 different things to actually use on them games bugged out to hell right now and i dont disagree there are some game breaking issues like crashes freezes and things that prevent progression my answer to that stop banging your head against the wall and do something else ya idjit i find the crashes funny been playing so long without them the game breaking and glitching the hell out makes the entire update worth while,1,1
230410,Warframe,this review has been edited on 25122016 youd think 2k hours probably spending almost that much money in this game maybe more and being one of the founders of the game would mean that i love it to death i did until the devs changed a bunch of stuff and started showing signs of bias and corruption within the community good game at its core albeit paytoskip has a decent high octane combat system its a great power fantasy game extremely fun gets a bit boring and grindy because you have to farm materials and pieces of gear based on rng i personally dont feel like the devs listen or care much theyve made many changes im not a fan of in fact i know a few people who hate the changes more than i do and if i ever go back to the game i refuse to spend another cent on it also the community drama scene on youtube with a certain youtuber who i cant name because digital extremes often ban people just for even mentioning his name being associated with him or whatever just shows how corrupt the developers are since they banned him for doing stuff that their youtube partners do all of the time yet they dont get banned one of them even said on stream that his fans and the other warframe yt partners should send a hate mob to this unnamed ytrs channel of course after he got called out on this probably got a finger wagging from digital extremes he tried to take down all evidence of the stream classy oh and new content becomes increasingly more difficult to get as well as suffers from power creepage an example a lot of the new warframes and weapons require this stuff called nitain extract you often need a lot of this stuff just to build this new content but you can only get it when a mission has been modified into a special kind of mission kind of like how it works with the new relic system called alert missions which only pop up for a few minutes or hours depending whilst i used to just buy the new stuff since i hate farming my friends would often complain about how irritating it is to get nitain simply because the alerts randomly decide when youre allowed to obtain it you would often need a lot of it too from my limited understanding and thats just the game also lacks endgame content once you have everything theres just nothing to do other than help friends grind for the stuff that you got before them or we this game will get boring very fast for you if youve sunk a lot of time andor money into it edit i should mention the new prime part system in my opinion sucks it used to be that you would do a level that needed an easy to get key getting the key and finishing the levels wasnt hard nor did it ever take long when you finished the level you would randomly get either a prime part blueprints or rare materials based on rng rolls now you have to get these stupid relic keys wait for an alert kind of like nitain that has the classlevel of relic that you need for the part that is in the specific drop table that the relic has then you have to not only complete the standard level in its entirety but you also have to do an annoying and needlessly finnicky minigame where you kill waves of enemies until you grab enough orb things to unlock the relic needless change the only good thing about the changes in this is that everyone usually gets different parts and if a squadmate gets something you wanted but you got something nobody in your squad wanted you can pick what your squadmate got for free and heshe would still get their own copy end of edit i dont mind if you love this game or hate my review im probably gonna regret writing this but meh this isnt really me trying to say dont play this game more so explaining why ive quit and if it does influence you into not playing this game or on me for my opinions then so be it,-1,1
230410,Warframe,play warframe if 1 you have no life 2 you want a good mmorpg game 3 youre bored enough to read my review 4 actually have a pc,1,1
230410,Warframe,caution overly detailed so i am very sorry so ive been playing this game for about 3 years now and this has easily become one of my most played games that i own not even exclusive to steam warframe is a game that takes place in space where you take control of a tenno which is the factionrace of everyone else that plays what is a tenno well play for yourself and youll find out with time wink what is a warframe warframes are the battlesuits that you control you walk as them you fight as them you hang out as themyou pretty much are the warframe yes i told you that you are a tenno as well like i said its just a suit its complicated there are currently 29 different warframes to collectbuild and use each with their own unique set of flashy abilities i say currently because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates also one of the most enjoyable development teams ive ever seen tbh and the community helps shape the game greatly anyhow the warframes are battlesuits for a reason in this game you are a freaking ninja in probably the most ninja way possible from wall jumps slides airkicks backflips gliding rolling super jumps throwing stars dual daggers etc you name it its probably possible there is so much movement and control you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system there is also so much customization in this game assault rifles rocket launchers bows crossbows sniper rifles shotguns laserbeams sawblade launchers wormhole creators grenade launchers laser cannons lightning shooters gas cloud launchers laserrifles infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks freezerays and much more also most of what i just listed are primary weapons meaning you also have secondary weapons which are your sidearms and melee weapons there are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms but if you are an inyourface type of player then enjoy your collection of melee weapons including single swords dual swords katanas daggers glaives bo staffs polearms hammers axes whips whipblade combos energybladeswell you get the point by now there are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own from warframes weapons companions little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilitiesor you know a cat or a dog armor pieces and scarfs this game is called fashionframe by the community for a reason and even your own ship your ship serves as your personal hub where you can access the star chart for missions your arsenal your foundry for building weapons warframes gear and everything else your mods and more what are mods mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game some mods being specific to certain enemies they also have tiers of rarity anyway mods are a very important feature and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons there are hundreds of different mods ranging from additional health percentages additional damage elemental damage which you can mix different elements to form new elements might i add ability range and justpretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more want a silenced loadout for stealth there are mods for that screw stealth you want explosions mods who are the bad guys there are a handful of different factions in the game mostly all of them against the tenno there are the grineer who are crude ugly bulky clones of other grineer made to produce a massive army usually found in their battleships or their own settlements destroying the planets landscape with machinery they look dumb but can be pretty tough another faction is the corpus who are driven by greed they are more technologically advanced than the grineer using robotics drones and lasers in their favor the infested is another faction they area bit of a mess disgusting heaps and masses of flesh screeching as they charge to attack they are basically zombified destroyed forms of grineer and corpus but you really dont see them that way considering how mutilated they become they dont have much of a role other than to spread the virus and most importantly kill you there are a couple of other factions but they are a bit spoilery so ill avoid talking about them why are we doing any of this in the first place because spacemom tells you to and you must listen to spacemom who tf is spacemom upon the tennos awakening you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of lotus who first appears to be an ai of sorts although taking a humanoid form you have no memory of anything before this awakening so you should probably listen to her she guides and cares for the entire tenno faction alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system she is your leader so what is the main objective overall bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise really its anything you want a lot of players get lost because they dont know what they should be doing but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions which you can invite friends to also this is a very heavy coop based game so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad or up to 8 in raid missions you can play this game completely solo if you want of course it will be pretty challenging though so lets start from a new players pointofview you have unlocked your first planet you can continue to do the missionnodes that it has to offer all the way up to the planet boss each planet also has a newlyadded feature which are known as junctions junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet and will offer a variety of trials before passage upon completing a junction you are rewarded with a few things such as blueprints for weapons a few parts for building a few specific warframes and they will unlock quests quests are sidethings that you can do which also give you some rewards there are a handful of warframes that are questexclusive if you want to obtain them as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way another recent addition as in since december are cinematic quests these are main storyrelated quests that have cutscenes and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore and will unlock some other nice things you still have to unlock these quests from junctions or even just through the market the ingame market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game the best part you can get most of this for free of course you can add money to just buy weapons warframes gear companions etc and gain access to them immediately but this is not a paytowin game not at all its more of a paytoprogressfaster game however building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun timeconsuming process the word fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject depending on what the building requirements are for what you are making you gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system each having their own set of different resources they drop from enemies loot lockers and storage containers there is even a warframe that increases loot drops while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead also you can earn the realmoney currency in this game by trading with other players im out of space at this point but all i have to say is i wish more of my friends could get into this,1,1

230410,Warframe,warframe was another one of my 40100 hour trips i enjoyed this game i really did i can tell you exactly what i liked and exactly what got me to stop playing make the choice on your own for if the game is worth your time though things i really really liked about the game and why you should play it its free it has an interesting arcade shooter puzzle dungeon layout feel thing going on it has tons of goals to keep you going kubrows are adorable you can play how you like if you like stealth go stealthy if you like running and gunning go do that aaaaaaaaaaaaand you dont have to buy anything you can earn prime blueprints from the void and sell them to suckers other players for platinum generally enjoyable things that pushed me away from the game i guess the only thing that really got me was when i was waiting for the next mission but i had to go through the next few planets to get there kind of a drag and finding groups for normal missions everyone just wants to do void missions and alerts rip matchmaking so now the standard game rating,1,1
230410,Warframe,you should be aware,1,1
230410,Warframe,its definitely a grinder but its a damn fun one on top of the visually appealing graphics fun and satisfying gameplay excellent sense of progression fluid controls and badass coop fun one of this games biggest assets is its perfect integration of microtransactions it never feels pushy hell you dont even have to do it to roll with the big dogs you simply cant go wrong trying this game out,1,1
230410,Warframe,firstly lets talk about the basics warframe is a thirdperson over the shoulder shooter in it you control your character and complete missions and quests taking place on the different planets in the solar system and if that sounds pretty generic thats because it probably is however you are not some generic soldier you take control of the tenno a race of basically humans designed as living weapons by a long dead ancient race who are lead by the lotus space mum to keep the peace in the solar system lets talk about the gameplay the controls are pretty standard wasd to move space to jump etc but theres actually a bit more to it than running around and shooting some missions require you to be stealthy instead of aggressive and since the tenno are basically space ninjas youd expect them to be able to pull of some acrobatics and youd be right its almost impossible to go anywhere without pulling off a little parkour in some of the missions now we come to the characters themselves the warframes these are robotic suitsish that the tenno control and complete missions with now theres actually a large amount of these ranging from healing ones to defensive ones stealthy ones and aggressive one each one coming with its own unique set of abilities stats and look there are no real good warframes as they are all good in there own way and who am i to tell you how to play your game so just go out find one that you like and have fun so the fact that warframe is a free game might put you off and yes even though warframe has a currency that is obtained by paying real money but that does not mean this game is pay to win this is because you are allowed to freely trade said currency with other players for their items so if you dont want to use real money but you want an item that you can only get with the currency then all you need to do is farm for a little bit and sell of the items you got to players that want them meaning that every single item can be obtained without having to pay any real money all in all i highly reccomend you at least give warframe a try i mean what harm can it do tldr good game basic controls basically 100 free to play space mums included check it out,1,1

230410,Warframe,i guess it was fun while it lasted its hard for me to write this after so long to begin with the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed we started playing warframe with my friends when it was not on steam yet like almost 4 years ago none of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time developers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a bandaid fix is released which doesnt adress the issue itself broken enemy armor and health scaling useless weapons and warframes aka mastery fodder energy management is non existant most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or op due to superb cc capability or straight invulnerability etc and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on every once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two twothree weeks after its been released and almost nobody uses it and theres a plenty of such cases archwing dark sectors conclave kubrows syndicates maroos bazaar focus seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced lunaro grind oh god grind increases exponentially with each new update i feel really bad for newer players devs tell they want to change the situation where oldtime players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on and how they fix it they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called cryotic to explain you can get like 100 cryotic in 23 minutes maximum if youre good at only type of missions where you can get it excavation there you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply oneshot by high level enemy theres enemy damage scaling issues too yup not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one after community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue devs release new primed warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource oxium of 14000 by similar i mean the way to obtain it you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best and there are not too many of those enemies after another community uproar it was changed to 7000 which is still a huge amount for many people and more so for newer players also void a place where primed glorified versions of warframes and weapons drop there were already many prime warframes released and some of them have already been vaulted taken out of drop tables the official reason for that is there isnt too much space in void mission for many primed warframes and weapons and not to create dilution in drop tables some primes were vaulted but from devteams actions you can guess the real reason is different there are several mission types in the void that have little to no prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago thus intentionally diluting void mission rewards also devs tend to put most desirable primed parts into most boring and long 20 min missions in the void and the chance for this part is like 5 or so and guess what its 5 for one of 5 different parts making it 1 if youre lucky for the exact part you want i guess its okay that people dont want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need not to go too much into details id say void missions are not the only missions that have this problem recently there was an update addressing most of op warframe abilities and that seems to be causing another community uproar now as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those op abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics im not sure how high level missions sorties or raids aka trials will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more especially when you barely scratch the enemys health lvl 100 enemies endgame here is like its either you relying on those op abilities to keep you alive or you get onetwo shot the moment you fail to do so tldr devs produce more and more content and bugs and broken mechanics too and seems like they forget of even 23 month old content ever incresing grind with latest updates exponentially warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these op abilities many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed,-1,1

230410,Warframe,there was a big bunch of bugs back in 2013 but most of them have been fixed by now so warframe is overall a good game for a f2p with enjoyable combats awesome graphics and all those weapons and frames that you could get its true that warframes coop missions are repetitive but it is still an impressive title with those awesome devs this game is totally worth a try,1,0

230410,Warframe,tldr at the bottom main features at the bottom before tldr cons 1 pretty bad tutorial the tutorial simply guides you through basic combat and nothing more the more complicated mechanics such as mods and damage types are barely touched on these two main mechanics are crucial ingame and due to the lack of a tutorial for it ive encountered far too many new players who are clueless you will have to google for a crap ton of information bless the wiki page 2 pay4convenience if youre rich you get through majority of the game faster but it is not pay2win everything is obtainable and the grind isnt insane unless rngesus hates you a person who paid money and a freetoplay player will end up with the exact same gear essentially you buy time in this game and nothing more 3 limited areas to play in its not openworld instances have a certain tileset for each planet it randomizes but generally remains the same there are of course new tilesets added in certain updates 4 its easy to get burnt out by burnt out i mean that youll probably play the game on and off when you first start this is due to the long waiting times for crafting new items which are the only way you can get new items on your own that tied with the daily trade limit makes it difficult to play for several hours straight but once youve attained a fair amount of items getting burnt out becomes few and far between 5 youre free to do what you want this cant be a bad thing right but it is for those who want some form of direction in a game i initially found it really hard to stick to playing this game i love every aspect of it but having no actual goal is painful this game is recommended for those who like lootbased games like diablo 3 pros 1 everything is obtainable if you play the game with the exception of the founders pack yeah play the game and get everything simple as that wanna get something that is no longer available trade 2 fantastic graphics on lowend pcs im able to run this on a pc with only 2gb of ram and an intel graphics card ive upgraded since then but it runs at a smooth 30 fps on that disgusting old rig 3 gameplay gameplay doesnt get dull unless youre one of those cancerous people who plays ashhole fast paced and both meleeonly and rangedonly builds are viable 4 the dev team its clear that the warframe dev team cares about the game and does not try to turn it into a cashgrab new expansion free new item being released dont need to fork up any money new mission do the prereqs and gain access to it entirely new mechanic that could possibly act as dlc freeeee 5 community you will rarely ever encounter any cancer players why because warframe heavily relies on working with others if youre a horrible person to group with youll build up a bad rep and eventually no one will group with you the downsides of being an are so huge that if kanye played this game youd think hes oprah or ellen or one of those nice people that everyone likes features a lot of warframes which act as classes extremely flexible detailed mechanics modding damage 20 large amount of viable weapons majority are extremely different from each all are able to be molded to endgame fantastic graphics recently got a revamp with better smoke and fire physics incredibly optimized expect smooth framerates throughout plenty of customization and cosmetics you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you dull movement system despite having a parkour system youll be rollingbullet jumping everywhere this is starting to change with the added orokin moon tileset limited areas to play in repetitive very limited number of mission types pvp is pointless you dont get much other than cosmetics ridiculously grindy a lot of flukes there are certain builds that do all the work by pressing a single button i kid you not check out warframe draco runs on youtube limited trades each day tallies with your mastery rank which you can increase by leveling items limited inventory appears as a cash grab quite early on but you can earn platinum through trading certain items are obtainable at certain times 2 main items orokin catalyst and orokin reactor they are untradable and ive personally wasted over 400 platinum on the market buying them because i missed an alert that was only available for 1 hour the recipe that can be bought on the market is stupid tldr its free but can appear as p2w you can obtain everything if you spend time and effort play if you like lootbased games expect to wait a lot community is awesome devs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes being a helicopter with dual axes is fun yes you can do that in this game,1,1
230410,Warframe,having over 1000 hours of this masterpiece of a game probably gives me the privellege to finally create a proper review of it sadly i am not privelleged enough to talk to women in public being the mysagonist that i am the focus of this review is going to be on the developers of the game and their means to communicate with their playerbase rather than focusing on anything in game like graphics story gameplay etc which are subjects that i could ramble over for literally days so if you seek any information on what this game is really about you should probably take a closer look at reviews either above or below this one it definetly is an odd subject to talk about but its the main reason why i love this game with a passion as big as the rings of saturn so why not just give you a background story of these developers you will fail the digital extremes story,1,1
230410,Warframe,this game is a game where prety much everything can be obtained through trade and patience i have reached the point of the game where all i have left to do is collect a few weapons and cosmetics in which i have made the money platinum for on my own time as a high ranking player i have seen many types of players and many changes throughout the game the gameplay and trading in warframe are merciless to those who start out the game but provides an interesting learning experience to read the minds of the person on the other side of the screen it took me a couple of hours to just figure out the parkour mechanics and many more to be able to hold my ground against enemies that you may think are stupid at first but then realize that they are stupid but hit hard even with the legendary grind this game has striked into players i remain playing the game seeing new content put out that never fails to impress if you are looking for a game where you can casually spend time with friends be astounded by the copypasta maps that always hold great beauty laugh at the funny bugs that can be found on rare occassions fight for the honor of the merciless tenno or find a challenge mastering the games distinct mechanics and unmatched thirdperson combat then i welcome you to join warframe,1,1
230410,Warframe,warframe is a free to play tps hack n slash coop game with stealth and parkour elements in it the player becomes one of the tenno space ninjas awakened from a long slumber who control powerful suits known as warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from lotus the graphics are just incredible each location has its own design style the environments are shiny and rich in details while the special effects are just plain beautiful the only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight in the sound department the music is appriopriate to the situation speeds up when in a fight for example and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction youre fighting against though it can get overriden by the boss theme if someone like that appears a few of the tracks deserve a mention for being just plain incredible such as drums of war becoming the hunted cold and gold we are not alone reap what you sow and this is what you are the sound effects arent anything special but they are diverse enough to not get boring or tiring the voice acting is also really good even if a bit scarce the gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective like killing all enemies or capturing important targets while moving through randomlygenerated rooms you get to use between three weapons primary secondary and melee which can be of many different types like bows shotguns rifles sniper rifles pistols shurikens kunais swords axes hammers polearms scythes glaives knuckles gunblades yeah this game has tons upon tons of weapons as well as an assortment of movement options including but not limited to sprinting sliding wallrunning etc you can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike as far as stealth elements go you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies you can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance or sneak up behind them and perform an instakill stealth execution some abilities can also make you invisible or silence everything within a certain radius the mechanics are very solid and its fun slicing stuff down there is also the archwing and its own missions where you move in nogravity using the eponymous mechanical wings shooting down foes akin to a space shooter while it isnt as diverse as the standard gamemode it is a good change of pace from time to time not to mention even more awesome the amount of equipment types of environments and missions you can encounter is staggering the diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale another good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well even with high ping you will notice an obvious delay but it wont impact your experience or general gameplay as much as in some other games storywise the game isnt really all that rich but it is solid nonetheless there is a lot of lore in transcripts and descriptions of some weapons and warframes and the quests also provide an interesting narrative as far as the identity of lotus and the tenno themselves goes as well as what happened in the past and what the player characters did before they were put to cryosleep im not going to be spoiling anything as you should discover it yourself particularly when it comes to the newest second dream quest i think this is it for the pros so lets start counting out the cons the game is still quite obviously a glorified grind to get better stuff fortunately most of the time its somewhat fun to play speaking about multiplayer if the hosts computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy with everything flash stepping all over the place another bad thing is the fact that enemies are pretty stupid sometimes they tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover just being covered from the wrong direction harder missions only strengthen the enemies stats together with spawning elites more often and sometimes new types of enemies also another thing is that the game requires a lot of grinding to even get moderately powerful at the beginning youre going to struggle to complete the missions that arent the absolute simplest of all since you dont have much resources to manufacture new stuff and the starting equipment is very weak and even if you do get strong weapons theyre not going to be powerful enough without a good assortment of highrank mods for them to customize their damage output of course if you have a friend whos been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started this becomes a bit less of an issue the amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited while it isnt so bad with weapon and sentinel slots you get only two warframe slots for starters kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team you really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things the last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up or you can land outside the map and fall into the void to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike and this isnt an uncommon occurence overall this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning but very fun game once you get far enough you should check it out if you dont mind a sluggish beginning especially if youve got more experienced friends who can help you get running,1,1
230410,Warframe,a huge game that costs nothing ever evolving with constant updates unique and atmospheric art style great but undemanding graphics nice variety of avatars warframes and the world s most advanced movement mechanics this is simply one of the best games i have ever played hop in you have nothing to loose side note the pvp part conclave is still in alpha development phase but very promising already if the developers would introduce dedicated servers conclave could become one of the best arena shooters too edit 10 nov 2016 they added player hosted dedicated servers this can only get better,1,1
230410,Warframe,warframe is a 999 free online coop vs ai game you control a warframe there are over 20 warframes to choose from and they all have unique themes fire berserker stealth etc and special powers fireball warcry smokescreen etc there are hundreds of weapons for your warframe to use rifles snipers shotguns launchers pistols swords axes etc every method of killing your enemies is perfectly viable i have the most fun when i use all the tools available to me for example ill use my fire warframe to burn five enemies then ill use my shotgun to shoot another six and finally ill use my sword cut up the rest you will always have access to 999 of the games content except cosmetics without needing to pay any real money if you want cosmetics you have the option of spending real money on platinum the game currency or you can just trade other players the ingame items you earned for platinum ive played over 3000 hours without spending any real money because i just sold ingame items to other players for platinum and then used that platinum to buy cosmetics warframe has pretty good graphics but doesnt actually require too much from your computer warframe updates pretty frequently so there is always something new and interesting to do,1,0
230410,Warframe,i bought platinum to buy some warframes directly from the store and then later realized that their prime equivalents were selling for way less 1010 would buy platinum again other than thatgame is pretty cool pros space ninjas fast paced acrobatic gameplay once you get use to itcrafting is simple fking space ninjas cons the game is free to playthere are many other games worst than this one and they cost usually more than 60warframe is totally freeit just takes some time getting into crafting weapons and characters,1,1
230410,Warframe,ever wanted to be a ninja ever wanted to be a space explorer ever wanted to be a ninja farmer ever wanted to be a space farmer ever wanted to be a ninja space farmer if yes then this is the game for you you travel around space as a ninja farming for credits and mods and all other good things honestly this game is a blast it has a great community that is friendly in every moment also the game is updated every few days with fixes to big things i tried the game first back when it was in alpha and lost interest quite quickly but i have now found the game once again and absolutely love it so try it its free d,1,1
230410,Warframe,so ive been playing warframe for around 2 years now and i have to say ive had fun it wouldnt be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one i have so im presenting facts as objectively as i can here in as fair of an environment as i can warframe is a scifi thirdperson action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids it essentially feels like a crossover between older fast paced games like quake and unreal tournament with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter that being said i cant call into question the fun other people have playing this game so i cant consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not but i can say its fair to judge other factors for example this game is based heavily around modding the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately and crafting the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies broken containers or enemy storage lockers to build things like weapons and characters to use it takes a very long time to gather these materials and because of this it has been referred to as farming when a player repeatedly runs the same mission or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it now heres where my reasoning comes in as to why i dont like this game as much as i could it takes too long i am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer so i havent had to buy much in this game using the ingame currency platinum which is purchased with real world money now thats fine having microtransactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work whats not okay is something warframe players refer to as rngesus the random number generator whats also not okay is the extensive nature of farming a significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a grindwall or rather an extensive task or list of tasks that must be performed before you can access certain parts of the game this is not as bad as dlc and it isnt as bad as microtransactions in some other games but it can be fairly irksome at times all in all this game is fair about how it treats many things especially how it treats microtransactions in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort except for one problem pricing it effectively costs anywhere between 2 to 15 to straightup buy a weapon or warframe in this game this is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem the value of time calling into question the fairness of the pricing of microtransactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time is it worth spending 10 to get a weapon now or is it worth spending anywhere between a few hours to a few days to collect the credits and resources to buy it then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft is it worth spending 15 to get a warframe playable character immediately plus bonuses or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources then waiting approximately 45 days on average for it to build the problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things i could have done much more in other games or even worse for 15 i couldve bought an entire other game i admit that warframe is technically still in beta and that many things still do need to be complete but this does not feel like a beta game any longer there is a huge quantity of content in this game which i would easily value as being worth well over 40 generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign no straight up form of sandbox as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your liset which is essentially your main menu of sorts the audio quality is impressive and the visuals are even moreso the animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at though the game is very lackluster in the way of animations for other weapons the vast majority of weapons fall into only a specific set of holdtypes animation sets with the reload being the only animation thats different in a lot of cases all primaries are held like a rifle or a bow all secondaries are held like a pistol two pistols or a gauntlet powerarm of some kind and a significant number of weapons recycle the same reloading animation there used to be a snippet here about recycled assets they dont do this anymore the enemies in this game are not always fair though in most cases its thankfully relatively situational for some examples nullifiers are a corpus enemy that project a large spherical field that completely negates all abilities and halts bullets though does not halt area of effect aoe damage their protective shield shrinks when damaged though there is a limit to how far it will shrink from a single instance of damage and as such the user is highly encouraged to use weapons they are potentially very uncomfortable with in order to deal with this one very exclusive and specific enemy the only other significantly timeefficient alternative is to approach the nullifier in melee range which opens you up for counterattack from enemies knockdowns are a very frequently used tactic in this game both from players and from enemies ranging from impact and blast being used to knock over or completely knock enemies away or in less fortunate cases used by enemies to knock you over and knock you away in most instances knockdown is avoidable with enough map awareness and enemy awareness but the much more immediate problem resides in the quantity of knockdowns and their presence during much larger fights enemies with plenty of knockdowns within their utility kit are typically encountered much more frequently during higher level missions in higher quantities when all enemies are uniformly more present making it very difficult to continue to keep an eye on the entire battlefield as a whole then theres the scaling issue and the arguement of utility versus damage as it stands the most effective weapons in this game are generally either very utility or very damaging with very little inbetween the most effective weapons tend to either be semiautomatic burst fully automatic rifles or shotguns explosive launchers while the less conventional weapons such as trap layers or flamethrowers freezerays tend to be much less effective to the point of rarely being used in endgame i understand that not everyone might see this as a problem but if a player happens to take a liking to a particular weapon they may end up finding that their favourite weapon falls off and becomes completely and utterly worthless in higher level missions regardless of how they try to build it because of how enemies gain health and gain shields and gain armour endlessly without ever offering any significant weaknesses to compensate for the increasingly bulletspongey behaviour or offering any respite for players using weaker weapons by choice and on a final note the community isnt exactly the best either a significant portion of the time it generally is illadvised to run with public matches due to both troubles with being left behind by speedrunners or being talked down upon by better players read higher mastery rank regardless of context all in all i cant really recommend this game to people who either lack free time or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be arguably described as an unfairly balanced environment,-1,1
230410,Warframe,i started writing a review for why after a year of playing the game i changed my review for it from recommended to not recommended and it ended up being far longer than is a reasonable length for a review it is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game and why i cant suggest playing it anymore if you want to read more on it i suggest going to the actual forums for the game not through steam but through the official website the players there are very active in posting and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game and talking about how des actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game and from the direction they were once taking it instead of writing four pages ill summarize it into something short and concise again if you want more specifics feel free to go look into them but ill summarize as i have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it and what has happened what it really boils down to is this the company is using grind walls and severely crowded rng tables to deliver content which is one of the least creative and worst examples of game design i have ever played it wasnt originally going to be that way but that is what it has become now and considering it is supposed to be an action game and not an mmorpg the grind really kills the feel of the game you are much less of a space ninja saving the solar system and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons all for literally no reason at all due to the lack of story in my 20 years of gaming experience i have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted and just outright ignore them the community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players and keep them interested and avoid just getting burned out on the game and patch after patch they go ignored from the past year of experience with this game the current state is that it is a fantastic concept being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable by an inadequate design and balance team,-1,1

230410,Warframe,now half of you will just rate the review unhelpful because its negative but be reminded that every one of these problems is something i want to be fixed not that i laugh about read on if you care or be one of the many who would disregard what i say because they think its bad to point out issues and will blindly follow warframe to the depths of hell itself to shoot down critisizm look at my hours i know what im talking about offputting community with really shortsighted devs first the positives its free to play with some restrictions playing with friends can be a lot of fun the problem is trying to get them to play the game with you its harder than you might think combat is fun albeit a bit buggy at times weapons and frames a quite varied making almost every item a new experience not bad in terms of graphics everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey its a free game now the negatives the game is an infinite power creep the forums i have never met such a nasty group of people in my life the game doesnt have too much grinding the game is grinding you are grinding to grind more the game is ridiculously easy you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month the paywalls unless you only want to have two warframes you gotta pay up that or attempt the horrible trading system the generic enemies of clones and spacemen most of the concepts are quite unoriginal the enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes or just generic space zombies straight out of something like halo or dead space the ai barely makes enemies a threat they will suicide rush you solo all while getting slaughtered the bugs this is a beta game but good god its been out for 2 years they simply neglect to fix them hell sometimes they create more bugs than they fix these things are so rampant it actually makes a serious impact on the games sometimes from camera issues to getting stuck in walls bugs ruin so much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes the balancing de couldnt balance a seesaw some items are worthless others op to the extreme the developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone while nerfing random items that very clearly didnt need it it makes no sense the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring they also just straight up ignore useless frames and items theres nothing more to say they just ignore them the updates most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game or a useless gun the end goal if you dont care about a number next to your name there is none the asskissing de will release a patch to fix something they broke and people thank the out of them yeah sure that makes sense not to mention any critisism of any of their decisions no matter how stupid they are will be shot down by their white knights the gameplay stealth is a neglected factor entirely the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage any other gamemode is just killing with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of overpowered weapon the devs greed they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new prime package and find more ways to suck your money out like slots for example the idiotic community just go look at the wiki every pages comments has someone on a weapon and telling you some other one is better they just bicker endlessly about everything the matchmaking there isnt any you have to go sit in a chat room unless you join a clan which you should be and wait for some rhino prime to join your game unless youre doing normal missions cause then you are out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time youre doomed to play it solo the money creep of cosmetics every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last you know why de does this cause they know their braindead community will eat it the up and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing thanks de into their keyboard as hard as they can the lack of progress with updates sure they come often but seriously they give us random weapons that whos gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be outclassed the updates never bring anything new or significant the lack of variety in gamemodes theres like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play ever the pvp this should have never been added the conclave is straight up dead being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy ill get to the reason behind that next and dark sectors are controlled by clans that use ddos and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats the lack of servers every game is hosted by a player which means lag a lot of lag it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable and its incredibly common the crashing i crash 23 times a day on warframe just my god if i had to list the amount of times i had to altf4 out of the game this review would be three times as long the movement you simply latch on to walls when you wall run nothing feels natural every jump every vault they all feel stilted and slow not to mention sometimes you just fly mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position the jumps are so irregular the melee combat you run up to the enemy mash the e key and you might hit them its completely random and just like other weapons melee weapons are completely unbalanced for the most part heavy weapons are useless and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down its borderline the argon issue every new weapon requires argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain this simply comes from des issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry the fact that certain frames are one trick ponies certain frames are only used for one sometimes two abilities while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored the lack of a challenge this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy with a certain frame and weapon anything can be completed by a braindead child people actually have to make up their own endgame of getting to high waves simply to have the risk of being defeated the lack of a skill requirement as i said directly above so long as you have the right weapon and frame you can conqeur literally anything there is no reward for being good at the game in fact you dont even have to try your best simply having the numbers 1234 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else the most ignorant developers ive ever seen here is an example there is a weapon called the dark dagger it is awful as every single handed dagger is however the hilarity insues when you realise that the tiny dark dagger is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer fragor and you think thats bad none of the dagger stances actually match the dark daggers stance polarity none that is the most idiotic thing ive ever heard in my life to be honest if you want to play with other people join a clan most of the community is elitism who dont care about the gameplay and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out the more people who dislike this only proves what im talking about with the asskissing every one of these points is true no matter how much people will try to deny them fanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted think before you post,-1,1
230410,Warframe,warframe is a amazing mastery based multiplayer game you can choose from hundreds of weapons and 29 warframes the good part is that you can mod those however you like you can choose from thousands of different mods the game has some grinding elements but the developers are trying to get away from grinding in the future new stuff is added everytime de updates the game regularly with more stuff for you to collect and balances to weapons and warframes you can play with up to 3 friends and there are a lot of gamemodes so you wont get bored if you dont have friends dont worry there is a good matchmaking system that will find you a party to play with you also have a campaign and a lot of bosses to beat dont get scared by the premium currency the game is tottaly not pay2win a paying user has nothing over you you can get anything without money as a player with 300 hours i never added money in to the game and i managed to get all the prime warframes and 1500 platinum cash just from trading go ahead and install the game i am sure you will like it get a friend or two to play with you start your space ninja adventure today good luck,1,1
230410,Warframe,quite simply one of the best free to play games on steam,1,1
230410,Warframe,this game is a metaphor for the unhappiness that materialism brings upon you,1,1
230410,Warframe,playing warframe is like being an irishman you could always use more potatoes,1,1
230410,Warframe,i have played this game for two years and have ambivalently enjoyed it there are many things it does really well the action and feel is great when its great and its got personality complete with your missiongiver the lotus being creepily manipulative and codependent and your ships ai being hilariously tourettesy and sullen the good parts have been good enough to overlook a lot of really irritating things but after years of playing this i have to turn my thumbs down given the path its been on for quite a long time the good has been shrinking rapidly in proportion to the bad and given that a game like this is one you play for the long haul i cant recommend it to anyone starting out as time goes on at least in the two years ive been playing it has only become more buggy more tedious and less rewarding to the point where i wonder if the devs respect their playerbase problems short version 1 the game has longstanding serious gameruining bugs that do not get addressed while new content introduces new embarrassinglybad bugs that should not have survived beta testing they just dont seem interested in fixing them 2 the game is a grindfest and thats part of the game and has been for a long time and thats fine within reasonable bounds but the reward curve has been getting worse while the game has been getting more tedious and requiring more mindnumbing repetition of missions not interesting enough to sustain that repetition 3 in their quest to extend game life and make more challenge the devs have been creating artificial difficulty by for example creating missions that are long and tedious and rather than requiring skill require patience as the players repeatedly engage in skinnerbox behaviors until the mission is finally complete putting 2 and 3 together the game is becoming a less and lessrewarding skinner box and its known as trollframe to many players now because of its irritating nonrewards after extended muchrepeated tedious missions problems long version 1 the devs seem to have become sloppier and sloppier pretty much all new content is patched in with insufficient testing and serious gamedegradingsessionruining bugs and frustrating glitches go uncorrected most recent case has been the change of how enemies spawn in exterminationtype missions in which you have to kill all enemies on the map to complete it apparently the devs found that some players had figured out how to complete these missions more quickly by stealthing them making them able to grind faster horrors so the devs immediately implemented a change that staggers them differently and makes some spawn wellbehind the players sometimes at the mission start making for a lot of timeconsuming backtracking it also makes it so not all enemies are spawned by the time the players reach the final room of the mission so the players just sit there from 310 minutes waiting for them to spawn in onesies and twosies its disproportionately frustrating like an extended interactive loading screen that just sits there for a long time but requires your continued attention to progress this change has not been retracted 3 months after the fact and its not fixed why not test it before putting it into production or withdraw it until fixed if it contains a serious bug there are lots of things like this there are a lot of bugs that just dont get addressed and some of them like falling out of the map which happens more frequently than it should have no ingame remedy and are missionruiners on the other hand if there is a grinding shortcut the devs are on that licketysplit so instead of fixing the backspawning problem making the player run all the way back to early parts of the mission to kill a newlyspawned mob making the mission take a couple minutes longer with what amounts to a fetch quest that has annoyed players for at least two years they instead introduced more spawn delay and backspawn to thwart players that might be able to cleverly shave a minute or two off a mission and interestingly completely avoid the backspawning bug from this i can only infer that backspawning is intentional and what bothers them is when players can avoid experiencing it your priorities are showing de that one right there gets them a big middle finger from me 2 the game has been increasingly oriented toward endless frustrating grinding with worse and worse chances of getting desired item drops its been getting worse such that these days people commonly refer to it as trollframe the game is grindingoriented we all know this but the devs have increasingly been orienting the content such that it involves this sort of grinding soandso mission will be available for 7 days and you can only get x item from it you need to collect all its pieces from repeating a long tedious mission which has a random chance to drop them as its endmission reward theyve set up the drop tables percentage chances of getting each item at the end so you can get a couple of the items reasonably but one of the items has a very low percentage chance to drop so you pile up extras of the first parts while you get silly junk items the other half of the time so you repeat this mission twenty thirty forty times til youre numb with it and despise it but youre pressing that twentyminute skinner box button sequence hoping for the thing grinding can be fun and engaging but theyve pushed the envelope too far 3 in terms of actual gameplay theres been an irritating trend toward more tedious and irritating missions and enemies the latest one at the time of this writing the giant robotdog razorback is a mission filled with bugs and made artificially long and tedious its not difficult once you know how to do it but it takes forever because of the way it is strucured press this button wait for bursa robot to jump down knock him down and hack him wait for him to disable razorbacks defenses now shoot razorback in a 2second time window that isnt really very clear when it starts so you might miss it and repeat 6 to 30 times depending on player dps and other factors eh im tired of the game looking more and more like a literal skinner box that razorback mission is almost humorously literal in being one except we only have a small chance of getting our birdseed at the end and im tired of doing it nope cant recommend it devs are reaching into more and more questionable game mechanics and feedback mechanisms to extend its life and its become a burnoutinducing tediumfest,-1,1
230410,Warframe,a good free to play game that doesnt push microtransactions in your face every five mins and is actually a decent game theres so much polish and refinement youd think that this would be a aaa game from a major options menu is great runs at a decent frame rate on any system even a toaster could run this at high settings and still get 60fps the game offers rebindable keys and also offers rebindable controller inputs which is a rarity these days other developers need to take note this is how you do free to play right,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,edit ive managed to get the game refunded because even on release i had to play it on lowmedium with fps drops bellow 50 for ue3 game that is unacceptable thanks for that atleast tripwire microtransactions check bad optimization check silencing people for their opinion check extremely slow development progress check announcing work in progress ps4 version before finishing the game for people who already paid for the game check 5 points for how to destroy your game and your community achievement great job tripwire thank you for wasting my money on your stupid product never going to happen again,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 1 was like a chocolate chip cookie simple enjoyable and there was no end to how much you could enjoy it killing floor 2 is like 2 chocolate chip cookies theres more of it to enjoy,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,is it a good game yes is it a good sequel no killing floor 1 was a better game back in its time even now its a better game if you can stand the potato graphics it felt more satisfying and gritty all they had to do was take the first game slap hd graphics and maybe some new weapons and maps and call it a day i dont know why they went for this weird futuristic style instead of the old gritty apocalypse style i dont know why they added the vs mode that nobody ever gave a about and they also added some microtransaction crates which is kinda lame but fine i guess as long as its cosmetics old paid skin packs were better you bought only what you wanted at its core killing floor 2 is still good fun though its got great graphics and you can still dismember monsters with your friends through various means if like me you played kf1 and stopped long ago because you got bored or moved on to other games then play kf2 if youve never played any killing floor game before then play kf2 as well its brand new and shiny but if youre still actively playing kf1 and having fun on it then dont bother with this one it wont bring you much more than what youre already enjoying,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,yes i have played game like its cocaine just because im addicted like hopeless drug addict and cant stop doesnt mean i must agree with all they came up with to milk money out of their fans im gonna keep this as short as i can here are things tripwire finds ok to do in what they consider product that is still in development dont forget this is not f2p game this is not even 10 game so they made plenty of money just from people who bought the base game the game was clearly rushed to meet deadline so dead silver stay happy,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,try to ban me here tripwire,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 is doing what the first episode did brutal and actionpacked coop zombie shooter in addition to the first game this one has a lot of improvements like game mechanics new animations for zeds graphics soundtrack and more the basic strategy is uncomplicated stay grouped cooperation with team is crucial if you want to be successful mainly in higher difficulties conserve ammo have a good healer know when to run away know what parts of the map give you the most room to maneuver i really recommend this game because it is a teambased game great for gaming with friends as well the price is very good,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,ive been playing this game since the very first day it was released on early access back then it was very bare bones and only had 4 classes in the game i have had the chance of seeing it grow and change drastically over the years finally culminating into the complete game we have now i believe that game is worth buying this is a very enjoyable cooperative first person shooter you and 5 other people try to survive against increasingly challenging waves of zeds cloned monstrosities set loose upon the world by the horzine corporation the soundtrack is death metal and its bloody as hell its a very cathartic experience there is an extremely large and varied arsenal of weapons to choose from split between 10 classes the developpers tripwire used to be infamous for their long development times and lack of communication with the community but theyve definitely addressed that problem recently updates are frequent and fast and they always release new images and previews to let people know what theyre working on even though the game left early access its still going to be constantly upgraded the 10 perks can all be leveled up to level 25 which can take a bit furthermore there are several difficulty levels that drastically alter the gameplay they change the zed behavior making them more deadly as well as custom maps all of those things add tons of replay value to the game dont know what else there is to say about killing floor 2 its not the most complicated of games but it has tons of content replay value and fun you should get it if you like fun,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,took a while but were here lads full release tldr at bottom what is kf2,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,so probably first of all i should say i really enjoyed the original so much that i actually got all 285 achievements in it hence you might assume i was quite excited when they announced the sequel the game is everything the original was with a handful of enhacements to the gameplay itself and several new features like character customization to stand out from another person who might be using the same character core gameplay remains the same so fans of the original will get what they expected with an added challenge as the difficulty has been ramped up thanks to the new ai and map design there essentially are no safe spots and enemies seem to crowd you even more than in the original title you want a challenge you will definitely get one with this game speaking of difficulties the only thing you ever see in a game with difficulty increase is one or more of the following enemies have higher hp deal more damage or there are simple more of them than on a lower difficulty now this game changes everything about this cheap standard as in killing floor 2 with higher difficulty also changes the bahaviour of the ai and the enemies get entirely new attack sets that you never see them using on lets say normal difficulty the enemies get more aggressive attack more get enraged more and tend to run instead of just slowly walking at you this is a really unexpected and intriguing development in the game world if we consider the technical side of course there is a bug here and there to be found but visuals are impressive and you cant really complain about the performance either however be warned that this developer as many others these days do not support integrated graphics cards so if you are on a laptop chances are the game wont work at all for you also the game uses the integrated card by default so be sure to change to high performance in your control panel before playing it now you might wonder why it is in early access if it plays so great well quite simply it is a finished product with a lack of content there is quite a selection of weapons to choose from almost 30 but there are only 3 maps to play on and even though the 4 perks classes that are present in the game work perfectly together those are only 4 of the planned 10 perks in the game currently so in conclusion the game runs perfectly fine visuals are great soundtrack is fitting for the massive killing that happens in the game and amazingly incorporated too replay value is as high as it can possibly get in a game and entertainment levels are over 9000 but the downside is the current lack of content even so it will keep you playing for quite some hours especially if you are gonna want to level those perks up if killing floor 2 was a zed itself then figuratively you could easily say that kf1 is its skeleton and the new additions are its meat and we all know the meat is the good part here,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,its the prequal to viscera cleanup detail,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 where to begin well first things first i should give a little background i currently have roughly 250 hours played in this game i purchased it during early access prior to the release of the firebug and demolitionist perks roughly a year ago ive played every perk in the game on every main map and tried innumerable custom maps im sure there are those with far more time invested than me but id say im pretty up there considering i love solid horde mode shooters i know many find them stale or repetitive but i could play a good one ad nauseum and never get bored even if it has no progression treadmill or loot rewards if the game play is fun i will keep comming back as such killing floor 2 should be right up my alley and it is for the most part first the positives,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,so before i begin let me point something out once a game gets out of ea the reviews from ea stop affecting the game so while the overall say very positive keep in mind theres plenty and i mean plenty of negative reviews on this game and mine was one of them but since the game is out i will review it as a whole game pros beautiful and fluid gameplay melee feels like it impacts bullets do too enemies come apart when they die coupled with zed time blowing a scrake in half with a double barrel shotgun has never been more satisfying nice assortment of weapons not as many as we expected from ea promises but its not horrible you can bet dlc will come out adding more as it did in the first game classes like the gunslinger and swat make a nice addition nerfing the sharpshooter by splitting it in 2 and adding a tanky alternative to the berserker who has some range nice selection of maps not as big or grand as killing floor 1 but they have more details some of the most fun coop horde gameplay around especially with the ability to jump into private games or make dedicated servers makes you want to play killing floor 1 again cons features we expected from early access were left out granted nothing was promised from ea but we typically expect to get what is hinted at or teased some of the classes promised martial artist for instance not included at all instead added the survivalist a class that essentially breaks the class system and just gives you random bonuses from other classes only 1 extra boss introduced in ea for those trying to claim the martial artist wasnt a thing the katana wasnt given to the berserker in ea it was kept out of the class roster weapons because it was meant to be given to the marital artist which is clearly visible here as the dragon button on this tripwire collectible httpiimgurcomyggn4d3jpg1 it was never promised and niether was anything else we got or didnt tripwire didnt ever lay out a plan for ea buyers but the martial artist was essentially a guarantee based on weapons code and products for sale the survivalist was added because 10 classes were promised and they didnt want to release more weapons with the last one so they simply added a cobbled up class with nothing unique in terms of tools so they could release the game with all promises filled this is essentially a scam and is a large part of why this review is negative the swat class was just as vaugely hinted and not promised in any way and it made it in its button is also visible in the link above so the martial artist was just as guaranteed as the swat only a year of support for this game is guaranteed by tripwire as of now so no dont buy it assuming it will be like killing floor one and be supported for years and years if tripwire sees fit this game will be dead in a year microtransactions in a 30 dollar game that were introduced in ea no way to jump into a private game with some friends short of buying a server or making sure you will fill any server you enter matchmaking or solo are the only options for people who dont have a private server this is a huge letdown from the first game where you could jump into almost any server with your friends and be guaranteed privacy playing with randoms in a game like this is hauntingly annoying update i was totally wrong about this i must have missed it in the patch notes google searches still show this as a simply impossible option you can indeed launch a private game with friends from the matchmaker now while this does not change the reviews recommendation it certainly puts the game a grand many floors higher than i had tried to portray it i apologize for giving false information thanks to just gertman for pointing this out also you can host a dedicated server on your machine and there are plenty of guides to help you do so if need be its too complicated for my little brain but im sure with some work anyone with a powerful enough machine could manage it patriarch and other story elements such as the kf1 trader are generally forgotten or ignored very little nostalgia is paid to the first game the patriarch looks nothing like his old incarnation and generally isnt scary at all now is a big hulk looking one line spewing weenie game simply costs too damn much to have microtransactions and the content it has killing floor one is better than this game in every way but graphics and costs pennies in comparison i paid 5 dollars for 4 costumes in kf1 i paid 5 dollars just to get fosters old outfit with gloves in this game conclusion killing floor 2 is not at all a bad game in terms of graphics its a massive leap over the first game the gore system is awesome and beautiful but other than that its just a watered down killing floor 1 and keep in mind killing floor one goes on habitual sales for pennies in addition to having microtransactions if it goes on sale for 1520 dollars it will be worth it to most people but in its current state i feel like i paid too much for this game killing floor 1 didnt have the graphics this game had but it had massive complicated maps a great amount of character a terrifying final boss that you honestly jumped up and down when you actually beat it which was a rare occurence and classes that all were useful and unique without encroaching on other classes in ea i saw so many mistakes made with this game from the microtransactions to the banning of people in mass on the forums but this review is for the full game and as such i wont bore you with that is it fun yes it is entirely a blast with friends is it better than killing floor 1 only in graphics for me others will disagree and they arent wrong its a matter of opinion and what you need in a game i could play a 2d pixelated shooter and enjoy it more than next gen if it was simply better should you buy this game sure if you think the content provided is worth 30 bucks and have a group of friends to play with you will often come to this game and play a few rounds with your chaps and you will probably really enjoy it i miss running through the farms in killing floor 1 massive maps spanning kilometers with my 23 friends fighting off an actually scary as patriarch rather than the big cartoony musclemass that spews one liners that belong to a spiderman villian we have now everytime i try to get into this game i just end up installing and playing killing floor 1 again thats not to say i dont enjoy this game when i play it i simply like the first game more that may change if they continue to work on it this review is right on the fence i say no because right now i see killing floor 1 as the better game and its cheaper that may change and if it does ill do my best to fairly change this review to compensate,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,finally killing floor 2 came out from early access i play about 110 hours in early acceses and after 141 hour and what can i say about killing floor 2 i have played the original kf quite normal but there big differences between kf and kf2 customizable characters added controller if you really wanna deathwish you can play zeds grabs you your vision will swing around to face it giving you the opportunity to shoot it or melee you can break glass you can run press it now can run by pressing shift xp bar located on the lower lefthand side mutiple spwan locations pressing and holding e button will bring up your welding tool doors have been breached by zeds will stay broken for the entire duration of the game trying to reload with full ammunition shot animation will appear cheacking the ammo melee weapons animation will wipe the blood hunting shotgun can boost you the healing self animation is faster vlad100 is now beserker weapon buzzsaw bow and the chainsaw came together to form a new weapon is called the eviscerator beserker gets a new type grenade is called emp grenade which stop a zeds special attacks katana and flametower was neutral perk wepon in early access but katana switched back to beserker and flametower to firebug more parrys using medic gun you hear a small beep when player is under 100hp using medic grande blue effect will appear new melee mechanics the flashlight added on more guns however battery meter located on lower right side player character will talks allot dosh has physics trader is french woman ai deploys containers use as the shop the trader will give advice such as buy ammo armor or gun when skrakeflushpound spawns a global sound will be heard by all players flushpund is way faster than kf1 and have more attacks husks can damage other zeds with its attacks husk can killhim self if you make alot of damage husk can you flametower on suicial difficultie new boss hans voltar his heals himself by sucking the hp from other players patriarch returning his 6 times lager and little bit stronger but killing floor 2 have cons marco transactions steam worshop need more freedom versus mode is not balanced i hope they fix in the future 810,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,edit 12616 my inventory has returned but here we see tripwire making basic gameaffecting changes to the damage and health of bosses i played for about an hour and multiple times i would find my health jumping from 7080 to 0 without any reason as to why wasnt hit by pattys rocket or anything that could explain why my health suddenly vanished which made my experience quite frustrating i wasnt the only one as all of my team members questioned what had just happened clearly this game still belongs in early access as theyre still rolling out tweak patches that modify the entire way the game is played ill be updating this review as more patches are released to see if they have any quality redeeming content edit 112116 as of today my inventory is completely broken in kf2 none of my items are visible and i cant even view them through steam stunning also experiencing my levels being set to 0 then magically returning to normal minutes later edit 11182016 i played the game for a few hours today and ive only noticed a few visual tweaks moments into playing me and some friends have already noticed that the scoreboard glitches still exist and the game even crashed survivalist is a joke of a class that just reuses old content without providing anything new or genuine it doesnt even get a classspecific knife like every other class disappointing since the game is being announced as complete on the 18th of this month i figure its about time that i post my thoughts on it now that i have almost 400 hours of playtime the gist of this review its a 610 clone of the previous game with crates a perk system 2 new classes and one additional boss itd be a decent buy at 1520 but not worth the 30 pricetag theyre asking for it now that its being announced as complete the gameplay is lacking a final grade of polish the weapons arent very much different from the first game and the mechanics are identical to the first game when the game was first announced and the boss hans volter was introduced and tripwire posted that it would be adding new neverbeforeseen classes it was speculated that we would be seeing a lot of new content that wasnt used in the previous killing floor unfortunately this isnt the case with killing floor 2 as it refuses to produce a unique experience that doesnt feel like a clone of killing floor 1 the game follows the same pattern as its predecessor although with much less flair where the original killing floor maintained an amount of individualism killing floor 2 feels like a cut and paste of the first game with overused fps clichs such as microtransactions crates and weapon skins that are nothing but cosmetic while theres nothing wrong with weapon skins or having a crate system it does feel as if tripwire put most of their attention on cosmetics rather than actual gameplay the graphics and sound are amazing along with the new mechanics such as persistent blood which can turn a shiny room into a gorefest buh dump tss and the incredible weapon detail sadly this is where it pretty much takes a dive while the game looks great it still lacks a feel of completeness that the original killing floor maintained throughout its development the game feels half finished and rushed in some areas with the cutting of the samurai ninja whatever class this is only more apparent that tripwire simpily ran out of time andor money to continue developing and are now relying on their cratemicrotransaction system to fund future developments of the game with only 4 days until launch tripwire is still having issues balancing the gameplay this only adds to the theory that they spent too much time developing their secondary income methods instead of developing more gameplay mechanics the hardest difficulty now plays like the easiest difficulty with zed spawns and damage being completely erratic and unpredictable regardless to difficulty the game still suffers from frequents crashes and lag spikes even on the best of machines which in this day and age is unacceptable for a releaseready game this of course goes hand in hand with the fact that tripwire todate has only produced a handful of maps now relying on third party devs to create levels via the workshop in my honest opinion this game is not ready for launch and should be kept in early access until it is in a more stable state if you are interested in buying this game i highly suggest waiting for a sale or waiting until it has more content to offer if you already own killing floor 1 you pretty much have already played killing floor 2 as the gameplay is almost identical with the exception of a few key mechanics and of course the perk system tldr wait for a sale,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,every single patch has made the game worse now theyre balancing around the pvp mode no one wanted and recently added a damage resistance system that turns everything into a bullet sponge unless you happen to be carrying the correct weapon i wish i could get a refund update for release they fixed removed the bullet resistance t but they failed to deliver on content promised in beta and have now decided its just not happening they still have microtransactions release update doesnt even have any major content they just slapped a 10 label on the ea version i still wish i could get a refund,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,its heartbreaking to wait years for a new killing floor game only for it to be a pile of trash here are some reasons why slow updates amp unwanted updates pvp mode which is heavily unbalanced amp buggy sharpshooter update that just came out only a week ago after having to wait nearly a year and a half plus there are some updates that only add hats amp weapon skins great job tripwire interactive you really know how to spoil us with content no content amp unwanted content microtransactions a player vs player mode and just the general lack of good content we want more weapons not weapon skins we want more maps more perks we want the things you promised us stop adding hats and weapon skins censorship on the fourms daily at least from what ive been told tripwire interactive is banning anyone and everyone who dare say their opinion i have yet to be ban but after writing this i might be tripwire interactive ignoring fans when tripwire interactive released killing floor 2 in early access they said in quote well be listening to the community amp the playbase to find out what they the community wants added and what they want changed not a single community wanted feature has been added to the game not a bloody single one besides hats amp weapon skins difficulty this is something that stood out when i was reading and watching about killing floor 2 dev blogs tripwire interactive quoted that they were making the game more difficult and insane but from my hours of playtime i can safey say they dumbed it down and made it much easier still in early access the game is still in early access shocking is it not tripwire interactive told the community theyd have the game fully released within a year by the way happy first birthday killing floor 2 youre still not finished and you have a long way to go to compete with your older brother killing floor still feels like its in early access even though its a fully released product my heart is broken by how disgusting this game is and how tripwire interactive is treating its community amp fanbase i love killing floor but not killing floor 2 i have to give it a 410 updated rating 310 for the finished product update tactical response eh update a meh update in all seriousness i thought theyd make it a dlc and was shocked even it wasnt i enjoyed the tactical response update the new class is awfully fun to play yet killing floor 2 still has a few miles to go and isnt there just yet update full release you added two new classes four or six new guns couldnt be bothered to reinstall killing floor 2 just to uninstall it again and like eight maps does killing floor 2 come anywhere close to killing floor no is it a great fps eh does it live up to killing floor not at all not even in the slightest,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,ok so this is my first review i am willing to write for a game which i have waited for so long for undoubtedly it instantly blew me away and fulfilled all my expectations im not a friend of early access games or how the community likes to call them ea titles this game is one of the few games i love to support even though its only in early access once you are in the game you will notice an inevitable few bugs and glitches but despite this overall the game is more bug and glitch free than other games which do not go into early access at all and get spammed with dayonepatches so it is at least for some users playable killing floor was amazing ever since it began as a mod for unreal tournament 2004 then the first actual killing floor game came out and i was absolutely blown away by it most devs cant keep up to their first game in a series but tripwire interactive managed to do so they even stepped up in quality of this brilliant new game kf2 is amazing and worth every penny that i so gladly paid i enjoyed every minute in this game and i am very excited looking forward to its full release with more weapons characters perks maps and much more i can recommend this game to everyone who loves to kill zombies and play as a team and yes i am writing the word team in uppercase letters because in my opinion without a good team you wont enjoy it as much you will wholeheartedly love this game if you follow the statements listed above killing floor 2 is already pretty bug and glitch free as mentioned above and i love that the devs stayed with unreal engine 3 they got used to this version and did the best they could even more so they forced the last drop of graphic quality out of it and the result is of course purely stunning all in all if any of the below things listed are for you all i can say is buy this amazing game zombies teamwork nice graphics big guns beautiful designed maps enhanced gore character selection and customization enhanced perk system fast and easy to understand gameplay final release still an amazing game,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,microtransaction in early access,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,fun game if a little bit repetitive shoot lots of zombies in slow motion use a bazillion weapons and buy new ties and fedoras from the steam market looks good sounds good plays good its everything ive ever wanted in a game full video review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwvkoawjxfic,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,now that killing floor 2 is finally out i can now finally say with absolute certainty there are 5 things wrong with this game right off the bat 1 survivalist class what the hell is this people could play how they wanted to before are you shoehorning them into one class now what can people do as their classes now are they not allowed to purchase any other weapon except their own classs designated weapon 2 another one of those games that is boring as hell to play alone and i can definitely say with all perks at 25 i hate this game solo 3 the versus mode is imbalanced and always will be the zeds no matter what you do to them will always crush the other team because of the bloats who can place mines everywhere creating a camping problem and gorefasts are force spawned on players way too frequently 4 they replaced the datamined martial artist class for the survivalist class why the berzerker could be based around attack speed andor damage depending on your playstyle even using the parry ability to increase your attack speed or movement or what not dont make the berzerker a tanky class like martial artist was meant to be the katana does not suit the berzerkers style of play its very based on finesse and precision berzerker is not precise end of 5 their communication with the fanscustomers when they were doing this game was terrible you expect them to actually fix stuff andor listen to their customers to make the game better no what do they desire releasing the market on early access customers to see how much money they can milk on an idea that could have been stripped away in an instant running away with the money do you desire to help a developer with risks like that i wouldnt i regret it too as i was thinking they were updating the gfx from kf1 and expanding on the idea not this 4 things i like about the game 1 its fun being the gunslinger berzerker swat and support classes dual wielding meleeing up close using the kriss smg and shotgunning your way to victory is very satisfying 2 being a scrake stalker husk and a fleshpound is so rewarding in versus i would definitely recommend it 3 hate grinding want to experience the game at full potential go to perk training servers you can soon see what the game is like without the long strenuous grind on the same 3 maps that people play its like counter strike all over again with dedust its not balanced or anything in terms of layout for versus its just because of people liking all the mlg garbage that comes from those maps why is this in the positive section well its the positive you can farm this annoying grind away because let me tell you the grind is irritable do not get this game if you play a lot of games solo like me they chose to release the market while it was still in early access if you trust a shifty company like that that doesnt communicate with their customers properly give this one a definite skip to tell them that you wont stand for shady practices do not get games in early access this is the first and last time i rely on a sequel of a good game to be just as good as the first always be paranoid everyone let them cater to you you hold money they dont unless you give it to em you have the power to make them better you also have the power to make them worse dont get this game,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,bought the deluxe back in 2015 got shafted out of the early access loyalty reward because after a while i decided to wait until the game got released if this is how they handle reward for people that supported and bought the game before it was done then i pity the people that buy it now very glad that microtransactions were very clearly a priority at least it showed what the real priority was money over the game my only regret is that its way too late to refund since it is too late i will keep playing it so that my money wasnt a total waste,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,if your a fan of nazi zombies wave survival games amp left 4 dead games this is the game for you i have played this game since it had been released waited to get an invite for the beta killing floor 1 was just a masterpiece and what tripwire interactive has done to killing floor 2 was amazing so where to start about this game gunsweapons,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 is obviously the continuation of the quite famous killing floor despite some minor controversy in early access its finally entered full release the only real way to play is online as offline mode is mostly uninteresting and feels dull everyone especially the fans of the original will be happy to know that the principle stayed the same however almost everything has been improved the classes perks who thought of that have been fleshed out better new zeds look much better there is a versus mode everything feels smoother and weapon handling is even better everything is again accompanied by heavy metal which goes alongside great and makes slaughter even more fun every game basicly goes the same you fight waves and waves of enemies with some time to restock on ammo and buy new gear inbetween in the end your group faces one of two bosses with some interesing abilities however nothing really out of the book while you wont have much problem during easier difficulties it gets much harder the higher you set it making tactical play a must if you want to survive on suicidal and up there are 10 different classes and they all play differently surprisingly all are viable and you are encouraged to have variety as each class has different strenghts and weaknesses melee combat got improved immensely and the berserker class relies almost purely on it zeds got a bit of an upgrade too they are still almost harmless alone minus some exceptions but they can pose a threat to even the most experienced players in a group you really have to work together as running around alone quickly gets you killed and finally versus mode to be honest i didnt really liked it it kind of felt like a bad version of the same mode in left4dead 2 its not really that well balanced yet but its still fun to play as constantly playing the same mode can get dull that is also my worst gripe with the game as you mostly do same things over and over again there are no quests to keep things fresh you basicly just kill everything untill the bell rings im not saying thats bad but it could be better if weapon handling wouldnt be some damn great i think people would get bored much faster conclusion great continuation of killing floor a lot of much needed improvements could get boring after a while but if the moding scene keeps things fresh and the developers keep supporting the game for years to come i think killing floor 2 has the potential to be a great game for years to come its definately my favourite coop survival shooter at the moment sorry left4dead 2 your reign has come to an end final grade 8210,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,this game has had its ups and downs for the whole devopement stage it started out as a fun but repetitive zombie killer then needed polish then the devopement team decided it would rather put micro transaction in game then polish it off and so months went by with no change then some updates that smoothed the game out but still the game doesnt feel complete to me and so i cant reccomend anyone pay full price for this maybe if the devlopement team wasnt trash and cared a little bit more about the player base i also decided to do this review after logging in a week ago to make sure i got access to their early access rewards and my account not getting them after messaging their support team back and forth i was told i was out of luck and never going to get them which was disapointing to say the least,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,well this game has been an interesting lesson to say the least i bought this about a few months into early access and i cannot recomend it pros good weapon animation for view models runs decently on my nvidia gtx 960 edit my card has 4gb cons extremely poor balance with zed mode the launcher tends to crash the game before it fully loads possibly a local issue very poor value for the price this factors in the time spent in early access and the timing of each update during that period as well as content such as maps classes class skills and progression to higher difficulties classes like the martial artist previously datamined are not present in the final version of the game despite being advertised as such blatant microtransactions and skinboxing easily avoidable but clearly this was where most of the devs focus went boss characters like hans were never really balanced in early access he alternated from being too difficult to too easy at many points i dont believe a proper balance was ever found almost as if the devs gave up while i enjoyed the first killing floor quite a bit it is clear to me that early access has not done this game any favors and seeing its changes throught the excessivley lengthy early access period never at any point gave any indication that this was a game that could surpass or be on par with the original killing floor 2 is a microcosm of why early access is a generally bad idea and i hope that it can serve as a guide for future developers as an example of what not to do had i bought this game when steam refunds were an option i would have refunded it two years ago,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 is a sequel to the popular and successful killing floor 1 keep in mind that killing floor 2 is in early access and has yet to receive a full release many players from the previous title may know that some of the new features of killing floor 2 included sprinting and crosshair which may come as a disappointment while i personally do not believe this should be an issue at all for both veteran and new players it does remove the aspect of having your knife out to run quicker about the graphics there is no doubt that there is a big improvement the game has updated graphics and textures which look significantly better than they did before there are 10 waves and on the 11th wave you have to fight against a boss either the patriarch or hans volter for now by the end of your tenth wave the map youre surviving appears splattered in blood from each shot you make its a good feature and definitely adds atmosphere to the chaos the first killing floor provided a selection of 7 perks killing floor 2s early access contains 9 perks for now berserker commando support field medic demolitionist sharpshooter firebug gunslinger and the new perk swat once the game reaches its full release it is rumoured that it will include 10 perks in total each perk has its own special skill which is unlocked at levels 5101520 and 25 and there are two options of which you cant choose your special skill the specimens in killing floor 2 are a bit modified compared to killing floor 1 there are not many combos you can use for the insta kill of the big zeds i have seen one for the medic with his nades and i cant even call it a combo more like a simple strategy and one for the firebug so it is not very easy to kill fleshpounds and scrakes the one thing i dont like is that if someone enrages the scrake or the fleshpound they can attack anyone they want so i find it really annoying to have them charging against me without being prepared to kill them headshots here are essential so try your best not to miss them i have a mixed feeling when it comes to teamplay when the waves get harder in some of the cases everybody just runs around trying to save theirselves and it would be pure luck if you end the wave with your teammates being around you because in some situations it is impossible to stay together so it is best to count on yourself to finish the wave alive there are not many guns added to this game but hopefully new ones will be released soon more maps weapons game modes removing classes imbalance fixing teleporting zeds and concentrating on the games development rather than adding cosmetics will definitely make more killing floor 2 players happy overall i would not recommend this game to other people for now because tripwire have turned it into a casual game you play 12 maps and everything is okay but after that it gets deadly boring if i have to compare it with kf1 a big lack of content sure it is an early access but there arent any signs of progress in the end after playing around 400 hours i came to the following conslusion killing floor 2 a game where disscussing other players performance it is more important than the game itself enjoy,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 has a lot going for it on the other hand it has a lot more working against it its obvious that tripwire has no respect for the people playing their games they have shown time and time again that theyre more interested in padding their wallets at the expense of players than they are in creating a quality experience from releasing an unfinished project like ro2 and letting it die on arrival to taking a year longer than they said they would with kf2 while not including all the content they promised to the creme de la creme of wasting development time and money creating a microtransaction shop for an unfinished game basically you should avoid tripwire and their games like the plague sure you might have a bit of fun with killing floor 2 but i assure you there are thousands of good games on steam alone im sure you can find at least one youll enjoy without having to support cancerous devs maybe look at vermintide to scratch your killing floor itch they did add some unpromised content like an awful versus mode that nobody wantedwants one cant help but wonder if the game would have been better had they not wasted time on that doubt it,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,this has the potential to be a great sequel but it wont get another penny from me due to the ridiculous cash shop on the plus side the cash shop is full of only comsmetics for now the downside is buying a key to unlock random garbage costs nearly as much as a full skin pack from killing floor 1 a skin pack from killing floor consisted of multiple overhauls of characters except for the voice not just a little hat i purchased killing floor 1 skins because unlike killing floor i knew what i was buying and i didnt have to gamble to get it the devs jumped on the gambling bandwagon to grab ahold of those who cant resist but to continue forking out dollar after dollar until they get a rare there are some good things about these updates but thats just not relevant compared to this issue selling cosmetic packs would have earned this a positive review but this system was created to with the gambling addicts and for that i just cant respect the development choices of this game they would have earned a lot more money from me had they given me the option to buy skins but i dont gamble,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,the original killing floor was the epitome of a simple concept well executed you and up to five teammates shot a variety of mutants who arrived in waves which earned you money to spend on better weapons between the waves that was it that was the entire game however it got the basics of great gameplay mechanics great map design and a meaningful set of difficulty options that tied in with the progression system so very right that it remained compelling everything i just wrote could be applied to the sequel as well but with all of the standards brought up to a modern level with the possible exception of map design killing floor 2 is once again a very simple game but it also excels in the area of gameplay mechanics good progression and a good level of challenge even if overall it plays things a bit safe continue reading wwwnewgamenetworkcom,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,i enjoyed killing floor 1 quite a bit and thus picked up kf2 fairly early in the early access process however when a game studio clearly has a hard time creating and implementing new content the decision to add pvp and microtransactions in lieu of improving the core gameplay loop is extremely dubious,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,november 18th 2016 update this review is now one year old and has been written when the game had only two characters and two playable maps half of the perks were missing and balance was nonexistent thats all apart from the trading floor controversy since then killing floor 2 has indeed improved a lot theres now much more variety to the process of smashing zeds a decent selection of gorgeous maps and full collection of perks and abilities to choose from the microtx are also less annoying the game however is still wildly unbalanced for two people less so for 3 teams which prevents complete coop satisfaction as final boss is virtually impossible to take down in 2v1 scenario unless both players are highly leveled some perks still need adjustments to bring them on par with each other the review stays negative as a reminder of atrocious practice of introducing microtx during ea and failure to finish and release the product in due time its been a year off already such practices are unacceptable also this cratesnkeys gambling garbage must die in kf2 in tf2 everywhere november 27th 2015 update tripwire has actually provided some feedback wwwkotakucouk on their controversial decision where they confirmed that all future free content is going to be sponsored by revenues generated from microtx that means all promised perks bossess and expected new maps are not going to be finished and released until enough money is sucked from community above what has already been paid that means tripwire lied when they said the game would be done in 2015 its not going to be done by done they wanted to say that just enough features would be implemented to support trading floor sic not the core content that was expected john gibson also insisted on how good ingame economies are and expressed his wishes about how community would create content for themselves apparently the content that tripwire was supposed to deliver and then vote on what would appear ingame so that they can happily dump their money in it for so much value and joy at this point anyone who defends their act is simply autistic and i dont think this is going away it isnt just as there were enough hatbuyers crateopeners and safedrillers so there would be enough addicts who would embrace new killing trading floor there would be pathetic idiots who would defend such schemes because they apparently are counting tripwires money better than their own and know it firsthand that poor developer is out of dosh and only another moneygrabbing scheme is going to help it and anyone who objects is a crybaby etc etc thats alright it is something that is expected from infantile autistic idiots well you got what you wanted i guess see you in game if i ever install it again after you spend enough of your money in zedconomy and at least all perks and maps would be released if because wouldnt it actually be fair original post,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor didnt have microtransactions why do they think kf2 needs them first one is still amazing without stupid crates and keys tripwire needs to get its head out of its and listen to the community and not the assinine shareholders,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,this game already wasnt as good as kf1 which i played the crap out of but i was willing to give it the benifit of the doubt because all of the content was not in the game yet but now microtransactions announced before even getting the initial content all in the game i paid for a full game and this is not a full game yet but you will charge me for items in microtransactions bah the overkill business model i hope this hits you where it hurts tripwire in the wallet i thought you were better than this update since release i was really upset with tw for a lot of reasons during the early access process particularly with the microtransactions on release it is ok still no kf1 but there is hope shown that they will get there over the years as they did with kf1 recommending this as a buy in probably in the long run worth it now i think but probably not for everyone a few detailed notes the new level asthetics are quite nice but i miss a lot of the old maps new maps seem smaller and less open this should all be resolved down the road when custom maps become a normal thing weapons i find largely dissapointing in this game hopefully that will improve bosses are hard much harder than first game that can be good or bad depending on howyou look at it zerker is different than kf1 i loved kf1 zerker others hated it people love kf2 zerker i cant get into it the microtransactions arent bad it actually gives you a chance at cosmetic rewards straight up at no cost i am tired of getting crates and usbs i will never open though no listen servers so if you want to play private with friends all of the time like i do you will want to set up your own server public players i have played with are pretty nice for the most part but i have also seen many hackers and cheaters,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,shoot stuff in the face get dosh buy a bigger gun shoot bigger stuff in the face get more dosh buy an even bigger gun shoot biggins in the face get all of the dosh ever buy a really really big gun shoot hitler 20 or the patriarchy in the face repeat 1710,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,barely any content for a full released game,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,still few more things to iron out at least there is a fellow aussie in the game edit forget to leave previous review points before updating feb 2016 basic gist said that tripwire originally stated at earliest 6 months after ea which would have been around october 2015 for release final release date was november 2016 pvp is official and worked out great didnt it ruffled a few soft feathers,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,ill keep this as unbiased as possible killing floor 2 is the successful sequel to killing floor 1 the zeds are much scarier then their kf1 counter parts and the clot now has a sick as swag walk the guns feel powerful and do some real damage thanks to the new meat system which allows you dig into the brains of a fleshpounds with an ak12 and the characters all have unique voices now which personally from my perspective is a great thing because it opens up much wider varieties of humour then just waaaankars however development for the game is slow and while tripwire are doing their best to make the perks feel strong and balanced while also preventing fleshpounds from being nearly undestroyable there is one very obvious and glaring flaw for now microtransactions in an unfinished game now i dunno why this even got past the suggestion phase the game isnt complete there are unfinished balancing issues to be addressed gunslinger is still to be added to the game and work on sharpshooter which im interested in due to the fast paced nature of killing floor 2 is almost nonexistant not only are we missing one of our core vanilla perks from killing floor 1 but the game is nowhere near finished in terms of balancing and perk weapons now this wouldnt be an issue if the game was finished and these items were offered in a dlc pack these items are simply cosmetic and weapon skins that do not affect gameplay in any form but the reason this is such a bad thing is because its preventing production and work on things that need to be addressed in the game right now i listed this as negative purely because of how strong an impact microtransactions have on the gaming industry right now microtransactions should not be a part of any game that you pay full price for its a gimmick for freetoplay games not paid products like killing floor 2 which is actually far from finished i would love to make this a positive review and i had planned on writing a positive review for killing floor 2 but the fact they are also attempting to censor any form of backlash about their decision on the tripwire interactive forums has changed my mind i will not say dont buy this game but i will say this with a heavy heart buy with caution,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,after several failed promises and a delay of nearly a year kf2 is finally out of early access i cant recommend this game in its current state especially when several features that the developers promised in the final release are still not in the game tripwire projected this game would leave ea by the end of 2015 that was false but its understandable that theyd probably have to push their release date back it hard to fault them here delays happen tripwire also promised 3 bosses by the time the game released thats the patriarch hans and the new boss the matriarch there was to be enhanced enemy ai on harder difficulties such as crawlers being able to crawl on walls the devs have admitted theyve worked on this but that its still bugged theyve had a year and a half to work on this game the 10th perk was going to be the martial artist hence the katana but it was axed in favor of the survivalist this is quite possibly the biggest copout in the entire development of this game considering that survivalist is a creatively bankrupt perk that required no extra weapons to be created and just focused on offperking offperk weapons are fun but they dont need an entire perk surrounding them the perk has been coldy received by the playerbase now real quick lets talk about the things they did add in that nobody asked for the resistance system to their credit theyve dialed back this system but for awhile crawlers could take aa12 shots to the face like it was nothing the team thought it was a good idea to give crawlers this huge resistance to shotguns and fire weaponsid like to point out that firebugs xp objective is to kill crawlers with fire weapons their philosophy was that you should constantly be changing perks to deal with the situation at the time how moronic versus mode a mode nobody asked for and nobody wanted go ahead and check the servers and youll see plenty more people want to play survival over versus this isnt left 4 dead killing floor was built on the foundation of coop and a versus mode goes against the very groundwork of the game who are they catering to in this instance l4d2 is still quite popular and is the preferred game for pvp gameplay crates and the shared content system ill tell you right off the bat that crates dont affect gameplay they dont what i will point out is how scummy it is to implement this system before the full release wouldnt it make more sense to build crates around a complete game no because how else could we sell more keys when all the classes come out it doesnt hurt the gameplay but it really shows where their priorities lie in that they would rather reskin the same guns over and over before making a new weapon for an existing perk shared content only affects one weapon right now the zweihander and can only be accessed if you or someone in your server owns the game chivalry any way you slice it this is a paywall a barrier of entry you can be completely denied a weapon if no one in the server owns that game and i dont think thats right granted its a step above killing floor 1s paid weapons but its still wrong and they keep nerfing the firebug what the tldr i dont recommend this game right now they failed to meet so many of their promises and their development choices have been very poor so until they get their act together im getting my refund,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,welcome to whose kill is it anyway the game where everyones thirsty for kills and your teammates dont matter still a great game though d if youve capped every class might i suggest joining servers that hosts 20 playes on hoe,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,rushed release trash game whats new with it,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,well where do i start this game is in no ways a bad game but i have to say that some of the decisions taken by tripwire were kinda offputting ive been following the development of this game since before the zedconomy update and i can see why some the early adopters are at tripwire microtransactions to be honest i dont really mind these mts since they are merely cosmetical but i think they should have announced the inclusion of them at least 1 month earlier to prevent the huge backlash that it caused slow updates now the updates themselves were painfully slow especially if we take in account that this game was originally planned to be out in 2015 stay tuned pvp the pvp mode was really bad at the time of release and i personally think that it was a mistake and that the time and resources that twi spent on creating it should have been used on adding content for the core game mode like new weapons the 10th perk the survivalist perk is underwhelming to say the least and in my personal opinion goes against the idea of having a perk based gameplay its basically a jackofall trades which does a mediocre job at everything also it doesnt even have weapons of its own it just uses weapons from the other real perks now lets talk about the good things its a gorgeous looking game well optimised even a toaster can run it fun gameplay just stay away from pvp mode all that said id reccomend this game to anyone who just wants to shoot some ugly zeds in the face have fun,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,microtransactions in early access only a few of the kf1 staff,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,a csgotf2like system with random boxes that contain skins and have to be opened with paid keys in early access before any of the actual gameplay content is anywhere near finished paid full character skins while already having the random box system obviously there are also going to be paid weapon packs with sidegrades i seem to remember one of the devs saying we want to show early access done right and this is not going to be a cashgrab short devblog posts about upcoming perks and maps that are barely a couple of paragraphs long with a couple of gif teasers while the trading floor gets a full graphical 3page spread of info neat but it doesnt affect the gameplay its just skins great i mean if it did there would be a real torm already happened recently to a certain other coop shooter problem is even though they said that a specific person is assigned to developing this system it still needs implementing into the game and testing which takes away time from the already painfully slow development survivalist okay,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,game is now out and would be fun if it wasnt for the horrble lag i get all the time even with double digit ping,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,1010 its just old kf but with new perks system graphic and map now its look awesome i nominate this game as woooooawwesomee,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,the full package,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,this will be pretty much a summary for people who came from kf1 and are still unsure of whether or not they should buy the game pros the most noticeable mechanics ingame are probably the ability to sprint and bash they sound like a dealbreaker when you imagine kf1 however the implementation feels adequate to the game especially since zeds no longer have 1 or 2 sets of animations now the zeds are alot more livid they roll they dodge they cover their bodies when being shot they suicide when low on health to try and take you with them im looking at you mr husk they have a larger variety of moves and attacks that will surely present a challenge to most people that are not used to it the graphics have improved tremendously each character has their own set of voice lines and you are able to customize them to your liking provided you have the cosmetics to do so even then the default ones are pretty decent the weapons are very detailed and feel very satisfying to use you can tell that even in slow motion most weapons handle as if they were real such as the barrel shaking while firing at the point of this review the weapon roster is a bit empty however as time progresses more weapons will be added into the game just like in kf1 pressing the reload button while the weapon is fully loaded will play a inspect animation specific to each weapon showing off the details like checking if your magazine is full or cocking it to make sure the round is in the chamber very addictive to do that there are more classesperks to pick from all of the classics are there are a few newer ones such as gunslinger and swat that are also very fun to play there is also a new perk the survivalist that pretty much focuses on offperk weapon combinations without the penalties of them being offperk you basically become a jack of all trades master of nothing there are 25 levels instead of the classic 6 and every 5 levels your perk gains one of two possible skills that you can choose to use during a wavegame each skill is created to suit ones playstyle so its up to the players to find the best combination for their style of playing whilst using the perk all the zeds have returned including a new boss and a few more clot variants that each act differently they bring more animations and extra attacks that will surely spice up your gaming sessions the zeds have different behavior depending on each difficulty example the husk now fires a flamethrower at close range on suicidal and clots gain extra attack movements among others new zed variants have been included such as the albino clot which explodes and leaves a gas cloud unless you headshot it and an albino alpha clot which enrages all nearby zeds buffing them up on damage and resistance zeds also can now get stunned or panic the ost used ingame is pretty good still very appropriate to the game just like the predecessor most maps are decent creating a nice atmosphere for the players stuck in an zedpocalypse the lights are dynamic which means that a bad placed shot or explosion can cause a previously well lit room into near pitch black darkness which adds to the difficulty and fun of the game cons zeds at the time of this review teleport to places when youre not looking its all part of the devs attempt to keep the player under stress during the entire round although i think the idea is pretty good it is badly implemented it leads to moments where you have 3 sirens behind you and as you turn the corner there they are right in front of you pretty much ending your life in less than 3 seconds the characters voice commands and quotes are very bland and not inspiring at all it feels like they are being written by kids no offense tw i find your game great but can you really step up your writers game the voice lines from the original kf were so much funnier and alot more cleaver than they are now ive seen scarier and youre not it really is that how you insult a monster thats trying to eat your flesh the voice line wheel i think the devs are going to change this but as of right now its a wheel that was made to used by a controler instead of a command where you press from 110 you have to hold the button and slide the mouse to the command you want to issue yeah have fun doing that on an fps with a mouse while being chased by 5 zeds while taking damage neutral the game features something called the zedconomy a system that you might be familiar with if you play games like team fortress 2 or counterstrike global offensive the game basically features weapon skins and character cosmetics which allow you to add extra costumization to either your prefered character or weapon just like the games i have mentioned you need to pay for them if you wish to obtain them that or simply cross your fingers youll get them on a random drop my personal opinion of it is that i dont mind them skinscosmetics are like the name implies purely aesthetic and do not alter your gameplay in any way what so ever if you want them you can get them if you dont want them youll still get them but hey at least you can selltrade them for something more suitable to your tastes conclusion even with all little issueslack of content that this game has do keep in mind the dev team is small and they are already working on another title at the same time rising storm 2 the game right now is already pretty great but just like the first one the devs will continue to work on it after launch fixing bugs making some slight changes and adding extra maps weapons characters and holiday events i give this game a solid 7510 after enough time has passed and content added ill probably rise the score to a 85 or even 9 tldr buy this game its cheap its fun and its totally worth it,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 is as if left 4 dead 2 and black ops zombies mode had a baby perfection aaaa yeeeeee,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,just play killing floor 1 it has more guns better maps better voice acting better perk balance better enemy mechanics better meta less bugs no skin marketplace and better mods and it just feels better this game has no soul it honestly feels like im playing cod its mindless and so fast that theres no time for tactical thinking fights are a cluster and with zed teleporting back in the game its even worse than before but if you want to keep holding out hope then i guess you should stay tuned until 2017 when they finally release all the perks early access done right you asked for this now here it is e3 edit ahahahahaha full release fall 2016 no swat or martial artist its just poetic how bad tripwire is realese edit no new guns no new maps just one sad excuse of a new perk what a complete joke of a release im getting my 2999 back hopefully the game gets good when they add some substance to it in 4 years until then im taking my money and running i advise everyone else to do the same and stay far far away,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 after initital releasei can finally give this title an accurate review its way more beautiful than its predecessor game is gorgeous the blood effects are amazingespecially if the user enables the flex technology sadlythis game isnt as fun as the original everything is so much faster too fast the zeds come out of nowhere and spawn so much closer than the first the game is graphically darker tooway more difficult to see your enemies during the actionthere is so much going on in the screen at once way too many effects from the health bubbles the scrakes chainsaw oddly glowing its too much figure out whats going on sometimes i went back and played the original not too long agoand remembered how much more fun it was 6510,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,we are finally at release ive had a wonderful experience with this game from the first day it was out all the way until now this game has certainly gone in directions that many of us never expected for better or for worse and regardless it has stayed an incredible zed killing experience unlike anything else on the gaming market do you enjoy shooting and blowing things up into little bloody pieces do you enjoy up to 6 player coop do you enjoy loads of money get this game original review as of early access this game is fantastically fun and addicting regardless of the lack of current ingame content learning the maps to avoid zeds all the while mastering the perks and weapons on each difficulty is worth the price alone to make things better more content is coming soon,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,i love the series and have over 340 hours on the original killing floor simply because my friends and i could enjoy it so much ive reached a 10th of that playtime on this sequel and just came back from a long hiatus after sharpshooter came out what the hell is this microtransactions are being focused now im expecting a longer alpha than day z for this one,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,so what can i say about killing floor 2 ive bought this game without having looked at any video or forum thread nor have i played the previous game kf1 the decision was just based on my fascination with zombies in general i tried out games like no more room in hell left for dead read dead redemption undead nightmare and the call of duty zombie stuffso after considering that there are so many games of that genre out there is killing floor 2 worth buying my answer is a confident yes if your pc manages to run the game on a high graphical level everything is very appealing and enjoyable the detailed maps are just awesome and theres not even one i dont like im also a huge fan of the different perks classes because theres literally everything you might want to try out you wanna slash zeds like warninja no problem give the berserker a go you like doing some aim practice head shot action play gunslingerthe mccree of kf i think you got what i mean by now a last point before i end this is to give u an impression of the community in my opinion kf2 has definitely one of the better communities out there if you are used to csgo or moba games you will be suprised how friendly online gamers can be,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,refunded as soon as it got out of ea tripwire went the wrong way the i want to be like csgo way and ended up withthis it is fun at first then you play the same maps again and again and again then you change difficulty same thing same maps but now the zeds heads are bullet sponges lack of content would be the main reason i stopped playing this of course its ea it is a phase where they work on that but they didnt intstead they added microtransactions skins specifically ugly skins moslty more specifically 2 euros to open one crate to get battle scarred skins added a pvp mode we didnt need nor ask for which none of my kf friends really play and they play this game a lot out of nowhere they decided to develop a console version in case the content development wasnt slow enough already so instead of getting us the story mode or the martial artist perk or some other things we asked or they promised they got us that dont get me wrong i am not against having cool skins but they could bring good looking skins or even animated skins like h1z1 did but not when you are supposed to improve the core gameplay and bring more stuff to play with yes there are good things in it no fps drops mostly stable builds original and well made weapon modelsbut if they had invested all the time they spent making that crappy pvp mode or the skins in improving the core foookin gameplaythis game would be completely different just get kf1 instead during a sale and enjoy all those maps and dlc content cause this is just a good looking kf1 wannabe at least these skins are not as ugly as in payday 2 guess thats a pro,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,the reason why i started listen to metal music,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,its a good game except for 1 it has overpriced gamblelike cosmetic microtransacitions 2 last perk was scrapped and instead we get a jackofalltrade perk essentially at least it makes it look like devs decided they couldnt bother with making proper last perk and because release date was nearing they chose to come up with a perk that really doesnt take any extra effort other than that i like the game but im not going to recommend this game until they remove the gamblelike microstransactions just one more game,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,if i would have written this review a few months ago chances are i would have left a no to the do you recommend this game question the journey through early access have been like a rollercoaster for killing floor 2 plenty of ups and downs personally ive enjoyed this game from the day it launched on early access and i still do today however i feel like i wouldnt do some of the fans of the game justice if i didnt mention some of the more common complaints killing floor 2 has gone through the updates for killing floor 2 has been on the slower side and there hasnt been a ton of content added in those slowish updates if you compare them to the bigger updates you see in other games such as terraria in no way is terraria similar to killing floor im just making an exampel even if my choice may be poorly however as a wise person once said quality over quantity and quality is what tripwire have delivered in every update usually a map or two aswell as a new perk with a few new weapons another thing that some have complained about is how theyve added three community made maps in the last couple of updates which in my opinion were really good and well made instead of official ones which may seem a bit lazy luckily our prayers have been heard and weve been blessed with the brand new map zed landing which is already a favorite of mine and for the first time introduces a more dynamic experience as the map changes over the course of the game similar to battlefields levolution which was a huge and very welcoming suprise that i truly hope will be a feature in the hopefully future maps of killing floor 2 aswell as the maps in their upcoming game rising storm 2 vietnam besides those complaints there has been some buzz around tripwire aswell like an developer claiming something like the players are too demanding when faced with negative reviews due to the slow updates i mentioned earlier in my opinion i agree with him game development especially for such a well made game like killing floor is a lengthy and not easy process however it may be a bit unprofessional to leave such a statement i cant remember the whole story surrounding that so id like to apologize in advance if some of the information i gave out may be false feel free to correct me on that if so but the grand prize for the hate storm came when tripwire announced a new killing floor game by the name killing floor incursion which is a vr exclusive title problem being killing floor 2 was still in early access and people were upset as it appears tripwire wanted a quick cashgrab making new games for the franchise when they havent finished the second one which they now have so the mistake tripwire did was announcing incursion way too early to join in on the vr hype as it was announced around the time when the vr hype was new and exciting instead of waiting to announce it after killing floor 2 left early access now that im done with my endless rant about some of the more general complaints against the game lets jump to the fun part the good parts that is there are now 10 maps in the game made by tripwire 13 if you count the community made ones and they are so well designed that i just want to send a basket of minimuffins to tripwires office they all have different styles so it never feels like any maps are similar and they all call for different experiences and playstyles the visuals and details are simply amazing infact may be the most welldesigned maps for a multiplayer shooter ive ever seen the lightning the formations the little things that makes the maps more dynamic like snowstorms dirt falling off ceilings the waves carrying boxes and debris the trees swaying the firesexplosions and the list goes on all makes for a bloody literally good time the animations are topnotch and theres plenty of them almost every weapon has its own set of animations reloading hitting cutting shoving blocking playing around with aiming you name it there are atleast 3 different animations for melee attacks and even more animations for melee weapons like wiping off blood from it spinning them around hitting your shield with your club and much more not only the weapons but the doors wind turbines and of course the zeds killing floors own name for zombies or mutants theyre all very smooth and sharp making the flow of everygame flawless mix that with the great level design and you have a game that will give your hours upon hours of fun the gore system is also a huge improvment from killing floor 1 a feature killing floor truly deserves just running around the map at the last wave seeing all the body parts bloodstained walls and floors really does add to the chaos this game offers if you ask me killing floor 1 amp 2 is a prime exampel of why im proud of being a pc gamer and two titles i think everyone should pick up and play simply a must buy and yes i know killing floor 2 is on consoles aswell so what are you waiting for go pick it up kill some zeds as they say,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,decent game just not a killing floor standard sequal,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,now that it is finally out of early access i will make a review this is a fun game it can be frustrating at times but overall it is enjoyable just as in the first game you will die a lot dont get discouraged and keep playing if you cant take the dying at first than this might not be for you while killing floor 1 is a lot more difficult imo kf2 still gets fairly difficult in the harder difficulties runs fairly smooth for me on an nvidia 760 if you need to tone down the graphics it still looks pretty decent there are the dreaded microtransactions but they are all cosmetic and there is no pay to win you dont need to buy anything if you dont want to team play is the highlight of this game all the classes except one have a specialty perks to mix and match and a role to fill on the team solo play is very winnable if youre one who likes to play by themselves there is a neat metal soundtrack to go with the game i wouldve preferred some thrash metal or more from the band that the original kf featured but it does a good job and its got some catchy riffs not a fan of the vocals but th e riffs are good the maps are also usually really awesome my only real gripes about the game as of right now is the survivalist perk is fairly useless and the buttons and perks get switched back to default every update i recommend this game it is fun and they will add more to it including holiday updates which are always fun i miss my gingerfasts dont eat me 910,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,very possibly the best feeling guns of 2016 which is something that needs its own award category,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,did not deliver on promised content servers are dead microtransactions before delivering promised gameplay content,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,not only where some early access promises not fulfilled the game itself just doesnt feel fun it feels souless on the bright side i got a refund even though i bought it about 1 and a half years ago since it just left ea so good on you steam thanks for the refund,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,microtransactions on a game that is still in early access with painfully slow release on new content save your dosh post full release edit i still feel this way,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,expectations established in early access were unfulfilled instead we get microtransactions and a godawful pvp mode that no one asked for while the fundamentals of this game are great the business practice behind it is not tw cannot be given a free pass on this as we got closer and closer to launch the quality of content added to the game started to go down the tubes when was the last time we got a tw official map added to the game instead we get community maps added to the full release that are no where near the quality of dev team maps wheres the third boss wheres the martial artist take one look at the forums and see the countless posts about content promised that we have yet to receive dont worry though its cool im sure the new kf vr will blow everyone away sarcasm did it really have to go down like this do i like kf2 yes do i think tw shafted many of us yes would i recommend kf2 begrudgingly yes,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,adding microtransactions while still in early access a questionable dev decision at best adding microtransactions while in early access before most of the core game content is even done these devs have lost their way and are 110 in it for the money its getting sadly obvious at this point that kf1 was done because they wanted to make it and loved the game kf2 is being made because their other games bombed and they need money badly all this while theyre throwing advertisements for the game out on hulu youtube and some tv channels and still calling themselves an indie developer and pretending that the big mean gamers are picking on them this game is a prime example of the cancer that is killing the gaming industry at its full release were seeing tons of broken promises cut content censorship on the forums and poor game balance,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,1st review it pains me to say it but because of recent events i can no longer whole heartedly recommend this game now or seemingly anytime in the future killing floor 2 has potential even though since its inception has deviated from the path of killing floor 1 i had my suspicions of bad things to come since the 2nd dev diary and those suspicions ended up being true tripwire interactive never stated that the use of microtransactions would be part of the core mechanic of the game and had never pitchd the idea to the community i would rather have dlc skin packs after the full release of the game the use of the csgo strategy is unfavorable regardless of whether or not the items affect the gameplay its nothing more than an attempt to create an ingame economy that encourages heavy spending on the possibility of getting an item you want i am excited about all the other content ive been looking forwards to it for a long while now im likely to be playing after the patch in order to gauge a proper opinion on the new perks and weapons although ill be playing to form an opinion i will not change my mind over the microtransaction implimentation this review is likely to change depending on the state of the game per meaningful update or upon full release an edit or review moniker will be added to allow a reread of the previous review vs the most recent 2nd review im doing this for a badge twi is planning on fixing firebug and survivalist game is done and shipped still have that dumb mt thing going rate it 710 low levels are dumb and keep joining hoe or suicidal 3rd review is probably gonna be more indepth,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,six bloody pikeys interfere with two scientists work love it so much always having a good time playing it,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,the hours ive put into the game speak for itself the experience the game offers is wellpolished and very enjoyable for any gun fanatic the attention to detail is amongst the best fps out there regarding the gunplay although repetitive by nature the gameplay itself is very addictive however this game still has so much potential at times it feels like the developers have only scratched the surface of what is to come heres hoping for the best of futures for killing floor 2 would i recommend this game absolutely does one need to do some research regarding said title before purchasing and see if said title might be something they would enjoy absolutely this game gets the weve only scratched the surface award,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,awesome game twice as fun with friends than running with randoms seriously needs more bosses though and some sort of implementation to increase xp gains like daily or weekly challenges,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,tripwire created a game that many different people can play a game where you can come into it at varying skill levels understand the basics and get good at said basics without carrying the burden of being a new player which often is the case with other hardcore shooters in a game like kf1 if youre new youre a burden thats it plain and simple so what we have in killing floor 2 is a game designed to induct more players variety in this game consists of the number of different guns there is no variety in how you use them to kill something you just shoot bullet sponges there is nothing to master in the long run the skill ceiling is low and you cant tell the difference between the average player and a veteran also everyone plays commando go figure regardless i recommend it steam has no ing in between option still ffs because its accessible to anyone looking to get into an fps the game on its own is fun for a while its one of those games were you dont need to be good to enjoy it but if youre one of those kf1 hardcore players looking for a proper sequel its not this and never will be based on what i said its up to you anyway if you want to dump your money on a video game decent game not a killing floor game merry christmas you filthy casuals,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,game introduces microtransactions that are paid before completing the core content necessary to exit early access and launch the team also took 7 months to add 2 perks classes and 3 new maps basically with the added paid microtransactions while still in eaccess this game is now pure cancer update they cant stop ing up they just replaced the last perk that was supposed to be martial arts scientist with a extremly boring perk that just uses other existing perks without new weaponsthe game got released today and im really really dissapointed i played alot of kf1 and i have been around since launch of early access and the game just doesnt live up to kf1 and im usually the person that hates the people crying about how much better the first game was and dont even give the sequel a chancei did give kf2 a chance a big one and i invested alot of time but tripwire changed like overkill did and many other companies and this game is just not worth more than 10 euros at max if you loved kf1 and dont know if you should get kf2 or not please dont tripwire does not deserve your money,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,update 3 was finally able to put in a refund request to wash my hands of this mess they are still heavily censoring their forums to this day and the last class they released was a complete joke just so they could say they released the 10 they originally promised never again will i spend my money on early access update 2 according to the recent live stream they only guarantee support until the end of next year unless they make more money theres so much wrong with this i dont even know where to start it just blows my mind that they have a date like that when the game isnt even out of early access yet update twi is now lying not only about unbanning everyonenot even closebut also about how many were banned in the first place while trying to pass the buck to steam global moderators integrity obviously means nothing to these people the moderation on the steam forums is out of control people are getting warnings and bans left and right for almost no reason at all just because they arent praising the game its like overkill 20 threads concerned with the direction of the game are constantly disappearing yoshiro is actually stalking people by following them to other websites and using conduct there as grounds to ban them on steam what the hell early access is no excuse for treating your paying customers like garbage this is all on top of a gambling crate system introduced more than 7 months after the initial release of the game having ridiculously slow development losing staff major balance problems screwing up the development cycle even more by adding a pvp mode that nobody asked for just so they could push their stupid mt skins adding a game conductor which nobody asked for the flex feature they were so proud of that still isnt working properlyso much for planning to release last year at the rate they are going the game will be obsolete by the time its finished edited for spellinggrammar,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,pros the gameplay is very solid and has a robust feel to it with having the melee combat and gun feedback feeling impactful whenever you land a hit or a headshot the graphics and gore are a very extreme step up from killing floor 1 as you can little cover an entire map with blood there are a handful of maps that go along with a handful of weapons and perks systems such as dynamic movement from zeds and zed damage blocking at higher level difficulties makes the game interesting rather than just plainly adding more healthdamage is a blast to play with friends or a well coordinated group of people cons literally there are only a handful of maps with a handful of weapons and perks it gets very repetitive very quickly if the core gunplay cant keep you satisfied playing with an uncoordinated team is worse than playing league of legends they added microtransactions to the game in ea with the content not being plentiful most of their ea promises were unfulfilled such as having a lot of bosses and the martial artist newest content pack survivalist completely breaks the point of the class system one of the slowest content updating schedules ive seen since cube world honestly speaking i love the game ive played 500 hours on it from the day it came out it was very fun at the time and i loved how intense the higher level difficulties were however the game lost its luster for me as i kept playing it over and over with my friends the content came out at a snails pace but they had the guts to add a microtransaction system to the game when they had little to no content as someone who bought about 10 worth of microtransctions i can say that it was a completely stupid decision as i couldnt keep myself playing to actually enjoy the skins buying the original killing floor 1 would be a better decision than buying killing floor 2 as it is currently,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 ive been playing this game since the very first day it was released on early access back then it was very bare bones and only had 4 classes in the game i have had the chance of seeing it grow and change drastically over the years finally culminating into the complete game we have now i believe that game is worth buying this is a very enjoyable cooperative first person shooter you and 5 other people try to survive against increasingly challenging waves of zeds cloned monstrosities set loose upon the world by the horzine corporation the soundtrack is death metal and its bloody as hell its a very cathartic experience there is an extremely large and varied arsenal of weapons to choose from split between 10 classes the developpers tripwire used to be infamous for their long development times and lack of communication with the community but theyve definitely addressed that problem recently updates are frequent and fast and they always release new images and previews to let people know what theyre working on even though the game left early access its still going to be constantly upgraded the 10 perks can all be leveled up to level 25 which can take a bit furthermore there are several difficulty levels that drastically alter the gameplay they change the zed behavior making them more deadly as well as custom maps all of those things add tons of replay value to the game evan tho i have 100 complete on killing floor 2 i keep comming back to it just for the sheer fun that it brings dont know what else there is to say about killing floor 2 its quite a simple game with a good amount of content replay value and fun you should get it if you want 100 coop fun d,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,you kill stuff get dosh buy weapons with that dosh kill more stuff and get bigger weapons repeat until boss wave kill boss then throw dosh at boss pros every class is fun in its own unique way graphics are fantastic including the gore weapons including melee are top notch weither youre a complete noob or a pro at the game youre able to select different diffuclties which also change the zeds behaviour which include animations attacks movement etc cons developers tend to lose focus on what the main objective is and that apperently isnt finshing the game adding in a pvp system mircotransactions and creating another game classes could use more weapons as every class only has a selection of 4 weapons would be nice to see 2 extra weapons for each class and offperk weapons players need to be able to get more use out of a door players or a support class should be able to temporary barricade or fortify a door as doors in kf2 are completely useless not to mention bosses just knock the doors down instantly overall though my personal score for this game would be 8510,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,they added microtransactions like before it was even released properly bruh what the,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,what the hell happened tripwire as a long time kf1 player this game was so promising in the beginning the gameplay was solid the combat was hectic and satisfying the guns were nothing short of amazing did they ever fix reloading both guns after firing a single shot with akimbo pistols literally the only complaint i can come up with the graphics were equally impressive and then it all fell apart updates were slow fine game development isnt an easy task and is timeconsuming to say the least particularly when youre aiming to release a product at its best then the microtransactions came a system intended to maximize profit for literally zero effort beyond the initial implementation and extremely minimal effort should they decide to actually add new content to the system for one thing the timing couldnt have been worse with another wellknown game screwing over their players by doing the exact same thing weeks prior they still havent fully recovered from that and probably never will even with all of their damage control and making their crates free to open though im fairly certain the trader crowd has happily moved in to replace the players they lost ensuring the already terrible community will never recover ill admit i was intrigued by the concept but felt it would be out of place and would waste time and money to implement it i am of course talking about the pvp mode pvp was a mode that everybody apparently wanted i have no idea who everybody is as i have not met or seen them yet i suspect theyre currently silver ranked in competitive game here and are playing that instead im assuming it died about a month after release on account of being boring repetitive and horribly unbalanced i myself played it for about a day oh and lets not forget the rushed i dont know but it literally brings nothing new to the game whatsoever new perk because we werent insulted enough with the delays unwanted content updates and questionable business practices already right i want to like this game at some point in time i did somewhere underneath it all there actually is a truly great game trying to break free of the things holding it down unfortunately it cant and never will,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,the best fps deathmatch game ever,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,pros nice graphics tons of gore raining blood everywhere weapons brings a nice output feeling such as motion capture animations sounds and effects less grindy than previous game in this franchise has 25 levels per perk instead 6 better progression sense good multilanguage support workshop support cons has less playstyle freedom in comparison to kf1 where we can choose between camping or hit and run now we cannot camping since the zeds spawns everywhere crowded with expensive rng microtransactions crappy loot rewards mostly usb and crates and with some luck you will got a battlescarred common weapons or headbands feeling punished instead rewarded by playing unwanted pvp mode which delayed content updates and caused some unbalanced issues on the pve they drop the martial artist perk unbalanced perks they are more flexible in the usage of offperk weapons that makes the perks almost irrelevant in comparison to kf1 unwanted survivalist perk lazy perk which aggravated the unbalanced gameplay issues that game had since beginning of ea lost the scary darkish and creepy mood of the kf1 now its less scary and more neon futuristic type of artstyle specially the trader and medic weapons score 610 tldr if you are hardcore fan of kf1 or if you hate badly the microtransactions you might get disappointed if youre new to the series you might love it,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,devs have taken the game down a horrible path thankgod for refunds,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,great game only a loser would hate it,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,killing floor 2 is the sequel to the popular survival shooter where you are pitted against massive waves of zeds which want to feast on your flesh killing floor 2 for me at the very least is improved in every way possible it fixes a lot of the problems the original had but it brings new problems along but in general killing floor 2 is still a fantastic game theres no story to speak of in killing floor but theres is a story in general theres a virus which turns people to zombies and civilians band together with soldiers to fight the virus on the streets of paris london and germany and in general all over the world gameplay wise this game is played mostly in a survival mode so each game you have to survive for a few waves where you then face off against two types of bosses one is the patriarch and the other one is dr hans patriarch has a mini gun and a rocket launcher to fight you off and dr hans has a toxic gas and explosives the game also lets you pick a certain class like sharpshooter gunslinger firebug or support these classes are built on what play style you prefer so if you like burning everything alive pick firebug if you like to use ranged weapons use sharpshooter now i felt that the classes in the first one were all balanced while some were overpowered all of them had great qualities which made them fun to play this time however i feel that that classes are a bit off like the firebug class not doing a lot of damage with the flamethrower the game also has new classes like a swat class which uses smgs and a survivor class which is a jack of all trades so you will find a class that suites you the best graphically the game looks great and runs great fully maxed out the game runs fine even in the moments where the screen is full of stuff being ripped apart the soundtrack is also great where you listen to heavy metal while shredding through waves and waves of zeds while not every track is great a lot of them are really good overall killing floor 2 is a great sequel and has a ton of replay value its definitely one of the games you can come back and play from time to time while it has slight issues with classes and other stuff i highly suggest checking this game out final rating 910 pros runs and looks great fun gameplay tons and tons of replay value cons classes arent balanced,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,its like payday 2 but with less updates and somehow that makes it better,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,i have spent around 170 hours on this game and although not all of it is bad i simply cant recommend this game for starters the positives of the game graphics soundtrack gore system the negatives unlike the first game where there was a lot of depth to classes like flinch locking with m14 for sharpshooter or taking down fleshpound with a lar or with support doing the standing shot supermanshot crouching shot against scrakes bezerker locking the patty and many many more tricks than i have the time to list here all of these tricks require many many hours to master making for a game that has a very high skill ceiling and rewards you for skill kf2 fails specatularily here kf2 classes are very superficial the majority of classes scale very poorly with skill making for a very casual game that gets boring very quickly simply all the tricks that made kf1 fun for many past the 500 mark is gone in all honestly you can master the game in around 100 or 200 hours really not worth the investment as by then you will mostly be bored of the game and end up moving on sprintingin kf1 there was no way to sprint instead you had to be careful with your movements and positioning so you wouldnt get boxed in and if you were moving from point a to point b you had to think ahead as to how to clear the paths ahead so you wouldnt get boxed in and killed in kf2 this doesnt exist instead you have a sprint mechanic which can practically bail you out of any situation so you never have to worry about positioning sprinting is so essential to gameplay in kf2 that before the game begins you should press whatever key you have sprint bound to and tape the key down cause you will never be letting go of it and holding it down the entire time can be painful on the hand zed sprinting so tripwire wanted to make a fast paced game unlike the first game while this does sound exciting in theory it completely and utterly fails with the way kf2 is designed instead it encourages the use of classes that can kill zeds very quickly with body shots like support firebug demo zerk etc classes like sharpshooter which was one of the most entertaining classes of kf1 because of its skill requirements but now its a very dumb down and boring perk to play which has been relegated to killing scrakes and fleshpoundsthe minibosses of the game with a railgun that can 2 shot fleshpounds and 1 shot scrake on hell on earth difficulty other classes like commando and gunslinger also suffer here so in summary i cant recommend this game simply because it suffers from typicalnext generation bad game syndrome aka visually stunning great gun sounds great gore systems good soundtrack overall very pretty game but horrible and extremely repetitive gameplay with a very low skill ceiling that deters people from sticking around after they have leveled up all their perks to level 25,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,oh how i love the smell of burning zeds in the morning lots of gore guts spilling all over the place explosions and coop what else do you want in a game a good follow up of the first killing floor which i played hundreds of hours with some new perks and weapons and a very solid workhop for all your need of custom maps and skins definitely worth the dosh if you like horde and coop shooters grab it while you can lads,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,more action more perks more gore more dosh better visuals better animation even better gunplay and no annoying hitboxes a good example of the sequel that sticks to the old winning formula and adds some spice without trying to fix anything that was not broken,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,haters are mostly biased towards kf1 or doing a negative review because of microtransactions all those things aside this is really a good fun game to play with your friends it just feels so good headshotting the zeds also weapons feel like they do actual damage that alone feels satisfying enough for a good review i really had fun with this game and i absolutely recommend it,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,pros the graphics are good the music is bad good atmosphere zeds are faster and will avoid your hits and shots you can run cons they havent added all the perks they rather focus on making pvp than releasing new perks the perks we do have are unbalanced microtransactions on early access game barely any content added this past months lacks replay value few maps not as many weapons as kf1 they added a class that allows you to use weapons from other perksyou could already do this without it they are trying to copy csgo with cosmetics and micro transactions overall the game itself its pretty good and has alot of potential but the developers dont seem to care about the game and havent added anything in these past months they seem to care more about microtransactions than the game itself and yes theres microtransactions on a early access game so unless you wanna wait until 2020 when they finish the game they were supposed to finish a year ago then i would recommend buying it i would recommend sticking with kf1 instead of throwing your money at a early access game with microtransactions,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,a team of 6 comrades work together to overthrow the capitalist moneyhoarding zed bourgeoisie sharing wealth earned through their hard labor 10,1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,whether or not you agree with the atrocious zedconomy you will be hard pressed to find many coop shooters that are as fun with as much longevity cant wait for the holiday events and new content,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,very addictive game for that fantastic soundtrack,1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,still unfinished update finished but still t 8,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,if you like censorship buy it,-1,1
232090,Killing Floor 2,update 6142016 this game is still an unbalanced pile of i doubledogdare any of the developers or players for that matter to finish a solo hoe with any class on paris or biotics lab with the new balance changes this game was wonderful when it first came out each successive update has ruined game balance irreparably the new sharpshooter class is okay i guess although the perks are stupid crouching is a terrible idea in this game for any reason whatsoever yet they made a perk based on it update 5192016 hell on earth is almost impossible to solo now even as berserker almost nonexistant ammo spawns no weapon spawns no armor spawns and not enough dosh per round even with 100 headshots to prepare yourself for each next wave enemies constantly block your escape route and getting stuck on an enemy just a single enemy even by a fraction of an inch will most likely end your run then and there enemy speed is too high even after fixing a bug that caused them to be superfast on hoe when this game came out it was very possible to beat hoe with every class provided you knew the best routes in each level and had a good strategy for the giants now its completely ed youll be able to beat it on the larger levels but just try running paris on hoe on even shortwave games youre ed period,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,as a whole this game is disappointment from its concerningly long development time ignoring community feed back and of course ing microtransactions survivalist is very lazy attempt at a perk just recycled weapons not even its own knife maybe get it whens its on sale but for now just get the original kf,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,as a whole this game is disappointment from its concerningly long development time ignoring community feed back and of course ing microtransactions survivalist is very lazy attempt at a perk just recycled weapons not even its own knife maybe get it whens its on sale but for now just get the original kf,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,its finally out and surprisingly it didnt take the second ice age for that to happen good on you tripwire so for this grand occasion i can finally update my review for what has changed and what hasnt is this fully released version now worth getting pros updated graphics and kudos on making the skrake look more menacing more gore makes it look like those overthetop games people play inside games or tv shows this is a good thing more music always a nice touch more perks though the survivalist perk kinda makes all the others seem redundant but thats just me negatives so you promised more zeds i dont see any unless youre talking about the two clot varients and hans which besides hans is absolutly abyssmal you cannot host a server for friends ingame instead you have to go outside of the game and downloadfiddle around with a program how the hell do you mess up something that was in kf1 microtransactions and on top of that csgostyle microtransactions i dont need elaborate on why this is a bad thing new fleshpound bigger isnt always better guys now he just looks like a doofy weightlifter with a blender on his hands small claustrophobic maps now these are a good thing regularly especially with a game like this however when you have just small maps its a problem design where did the grittiness from kf1 go aint here thats for sure nosireebob just future and metal weeeee new pvp gamemode why now you have to balance a game that is abotu pve around its pvp element wheres the fun in that although a for effort in trying to add a new gamemode hey remember how bloats and sirens were annoying but manageable in kf1 those were the days huh now bloats are bulletsponges and sirens pack metal armor that just ping off your shots so do fleshpounds but im giving them a pass for that making them more threatening than annoying like the other two kf2 has no charm the only reason i remember kf2 is because its the sequel to kf1 and that its what taught me never to buy earlyaccess games tldr kf2 is inferior to kf1 dont waste your money on this buy kf1 instead,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,good start bad end lazy greedy devs no endless mode that was meant to be ready for release no 10th perk survavalist is just a lazy effort for say hey we coded half day to do it no new weapons still pretty unbalanced moderator and devs abuse of power banning everyone some weapons sounds are placeholder ak12 medic weapon rifle sub machine for swat and medic still fun game to play from time to time grab it on 75 discount just for the way twi during all the ea acted to their customers changing priority and ton of lies,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,perks fix its not the first time that i complain about this perks and it wont be the last either if twi doesnt fix them i am not saying that the other perks are perfectly designed at the momentespecially survivalist which is a joke but these 3 need some serious review and fix lets start with berserker the biggest problem of this perk is it being way too op at the moment to a point its game breaking and i am sick and tired of seeing skilless players clutching waves of team wipe just because they were playing as zerk with skirmisher vampire and berserker rage on board you get 3 out of 5 perk skills that can restore hp on top of the standard syringe healing resistances are fine at the moment as they kinda defines zerk but all these features with speed bouns added together then its not fine because you simply get not only the strongest but also an op perk in game you can run through siren stacks husk groups bloat mines easily and make it out alive without even swiping your weapon once and thats just not right you can just keep running away from raged scrakes and fleshpounds because they either will never be able to catch up or you will have full hp again by the time they land a lucky hit on you which dosent hurt at all so who needs to risk fighting a raged zed when you can just hold sprint and run away from everything i thought the whole point of big zeds is to post a threat that you have do deal with immediately armour is nothing more than a piece of decoration for zerk and the only time you might actually need it is boss wave so to begin with the skirmisher skill needs to get fixed as it allows regeneration of 2 hp per second instead of 1 which is stated on the perk skill definition vampire is as good as it is meanwhile berserker rage needs to get fixed as well make it cant be stacked alongside zed time extension then its more fair resistances and hp restoring skills are fine but they should not be allowed together with run speed bonus not 25 at least ive complained on eviscerator before and i am not gonna repeat the details again this weapon is far too effective against scrakesand require very little skill even it costs 1600 and weights 10 blocks dont even try to bring in comparisons like aa12 or railgun because first of all they dont have recyclable ammo and second they are not as effectiveaa12 in killing scrakes or basically compromise your weapon layoutrailgun while zerk only needs a katana alongside evis which is a t2 weapon can handle all small and medium zeds easily and doesnt need ammo at all my suggestion is increasing the headshot requirement with evis to at least 3 if not more another perk that i have to complain about is demo which is also op as hell under the right circumstances by that i mean with the protection from other perks which sounds reasonable until you actually play the game where all you will see is a demo hiding behind whatever perks and just bombard a position for an entire wave the main reason for this is demo has way too many ammo right now with m79 rpg loadout with the ammo boosting perk skill chosen you can have up to 60 shots of explosives to fire per wave i am not implying that a high ammunition count will indefinitely lead to mindless bombarding playstyle but it definitely encourages it because who give a about ammo management when you have so many spare shots not to mention demo is perk where you dont need to worry about accuracy and still wrecks the zeds the problem resulting from such high ammunition count is that it renders other perks useless because demo can just blow up everything on his own i thought this game is about cooperation where different perks have different roles and now we got a perk that can do everything while other perks are just there to finish off a few small zeds that escaped from blasts occasionally are you serious tripwire to fix this perk the ammo count of m79 and rpg needs to be nerfed seriously like 50 of the current state but damage and radius of explosions can be increased to compensate and to encourage skill shots shots should only be fired in case of emergency instead of at a constant rate and obscuring other perks from playing the game swat and commando are there to clean up small zeds and that should be their job not demos rpg headshots on scrakes should be increased to 3 shots minimum it should be used as an emergency measure not a fancy trick to replace the role of other perks scrake should have even higher body resistance to explosion blunt damage because now it takes like 3 shots to kill one thats not quite enough to emphasize its resistance against explosives as i still see demos shooting scrakes all the time that being said the grenade capacity of demo can be increased to 10 and with a high stun power to give him ability to control large zeds m16 203 could use more ammobullets and reload mechanism needs to be separated where pressing r only reloads the clip and pressing mmb reloads the underbarrel grenade launcher door traps should do more damage perhaps equivalent to a c4 to make it more useful the damage of c4 can be massively increased to promote its use and please remove that 3 seconds interval damage nerf in case you havent which makes no sense at all limiting the number of c4s that can be placed in map to 8 would be just fineregardless of the number of demo players and lastly firebug needs some good buff as it is too lame to use right now you nerfed flame weapons damage because they cause too much damage isnt that the whole concept of firebug dishing out massive damage at close range while being almost useless at medium range or above and the microwave gun needs a good fix as it deals too little damage overall give it back its advantage against scrakes like before and increase its basic damage so it deserves the cost and weight as a t4 weapon right now firebug has zero contribution on large zeds elimination and all they can do is stirring up making life of other perks ten times harder,-1,0
232090,Killing Floor 2,i stayed up playing this game till 4 in the morning the day i got it just to level my perks please send help 1010,1,1
244850,Space Engineers,this review is very outdated this is the review of the game back in december of 2013 thank you all for reading a bit about the game and developers space engineers is a sandbox game about engineering construction and maintenance of space works imagine it as minecraft in space where you can fly what ever you build by your own hands this game is still in a very early alpha stage therefore you must know that a lot of things might and most likely will change space engineers is being developed by keen software house which are the same guys behind vrage and miner wars about gameplay as said above space engineers is something like minecraft currently the game futures only creative game mode in which the player has unlimited resources player can just open his inventory put the items into the toolbar and use how he she wishes to use it but there is a small twist this game is not a voxel based game therefore building something is much harder than most of the other games you have to turn the object how you see fit and putting other objects might be a bit hard since the objects maybe wont be in a good angle there are many various items that you can use to build your small ship big ship or a station as it is probably obvious you can fly small and big ship but you cant fly a station and you really wanted to make a huge carrier didnt you well no problem just make a massive big ship make it so big that it can actually keep other big ships inside of it nothing and no one can stop you from doing that will it be slow of course it will but you still did it you can really build what ever type of a space ship or a space station that you wanted to the game also has a lot of very nice parts that look nice inside of the stations such as doors or inner walls etc everything in this game is destructible and by that i mean everything that you have built or your friend even if its an accident you cant stop it if your ship is about to crash into a station you can do your best to evade it but you will most likely fail and destroy half of the station and the ship and the amazing thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that the destructed objects look amazing i have to say this game will have multiplayer in the future the developers have already confirmed that a long time ago and i can tell you the multiplayer of this game is going to be amazing imagine four or five player building massive ships and stations gosh i cant wait to do that even though the game is in very early alpha and it really doesnt offer too much to do for now exploring the current content of the game already showed me that this game has a lot of potential and that it might actually have a very bright future graphic and audio graphically speaking the game looks very good but its nothing too special the visual effects of explosions are very good and destroyed items look amazing the games building blocks dont look the same in fact they are built in a way that they keep continuing each other all the time therefore each part of your ship looks somewhat different the game also futures coloring therefore you can have a rainbow ship well you cant really make that but you can try music on the other hand isnt anything too special its very fun at the beginning but it gets rather repeatable after a while pros cons and final grade pros space sandbox building game multiplayer in the future a lot of different blocks with which you can make many many different ships ability to mine through the asteroids and get minerals we will see what will we be able to use them for in the near future cons jet pack is very hard to use flying anything is very hard and there is almost no way to stop your ship midair it will keep on flying away final grade 7510 extra info as mentioned earlier this game looks very promising i can guarantee that as soon as this game releases multiplayer it will be much better and much more fun we just have to wait and see what will the developers do and also i wish everyone happy holidays merry christmas and happy new year to everyone,1,0
244850,Space Engineers,added extra drills to a ship thrusters were too close and burned them down stopped in the middle of space to remove faulty thrusters forgot i cant break without them and crashed into friends ship somehow survived lost reactor in the process im now floating away into void spinning like crazy 1110 would engineer again,1,1
244850,Space Engineers,say goodbye to minecraftinspace sandbox games space engineers is in my opinion a masterpiece and while still under development is most definitely worth your time and money if youre in to the creative sandbox genre as of now i wont criticize it too heavily since it is still in early access however i will review the general components of the game graphics the realistic graphical style of the game is quite fitting and very easy to look at boasting a ton of highquality textures the lighting is also very well done sound the sound design is pretty solid even though not all of it has been implemented although the music soundtracks are very engaging and fitting if the game had its own official ost i would buy it personally gameplay mechanics whats currently presented is quite impressive however there are some hiccups as this is an early access game you will most likely find bugs glitches and generally unfinished mechanics as you play once again keep in mind that this game is still a wip multiplayeroptimization now this is where the game currently falls short the lag in multiplayer can become unbearable same can be said on singleplayer although it is much less severe both instances of dropped framerate both in mp and sp are usually caused by eitheror both how many objects are in the world or the hosts connection thankfully they have added dedicated servers but they are still a wip with this kind of framerate issue it is nearly impossible to have largescale projects with you andor your friends without a hint of dropped framerate while the devs are working vigorously to optimize the game as a whole it is probably a category of the game that wont be perfected for a while replayability this is something i really dont need to go into its a sandbox game it only ever ends when you stop playing it entirely and since there are essentially limitless things to do theres an infinite amount of replayability while the game does suffer from optimization issues and unfinished mechanics remember that this game is still in early access its not the final product with that said heres my take on the rating system based on the games current state graphics 810 sound 710 gameplay 710 optimization 4510 replayability 1010 overall rating 710 a solid sandbox title especially for the price of 2000 however this rating could go up or down in the future as this is an early access title this rating is based on what the game is like now not on how it will be in the future i have high hopes for space engineers and i hope it is all the devs and the fans want it to be when it is released as a final product,1,0
244850,Space Engineers,you will like this game trust me im an engineer,1,0

244850,Space Engineers,if u like space sim then u should get this game new update coming almost every week and it is just awsome,1,0
244850,Space Engineers,maybe its just me but i honestly dont love the game at its current stage im having lots of trouble with movement and it really ruins it for me ships are too slow and even nudging a small ship sends it spinning another problem is that you need to place thrusters on every surface of your ship to have any control honestly i wish that playing didnt feel like a challenge in itself rating 410 edit 6814 after playing the game more and enjoying the steady and content rich updates i can safely say that this game has really become one that i would recommend i love the new survival mode and the multiplayer is very seamless and well done i hope that the game had a few more graphics settings but at this point i really do like it updated rating 7510,1,0
244850,Space Engineers,whilst this is in an alpha state it is a very promising game the engine works well on my build i5 4670 34ghz 8gb 1600mhz kingston blue evga 560 gtx sc 1gb 500gb western digital 7200rpm cavlier blue,1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this is everything a remake should be more items more characters more challenges more bosses more everything my computer is old and chugs with games like minecraft and team fortress 2 but isaac rebirth runs silky smooth three words buy this game,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the amount of stuff to grab and to do insane new engine blows the old isaac out of the water fire effects shadows etc game is amazingly smooth and clean too many achievements to count for too many hours spent in perspective best poop simulator ever incompatible with social life outside the pc update had the music on the but moved it here sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run its kinda grating makes me miss dannys amazing soundtrack,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,if you get into this game you will no longer find it weird when people say things like i hope ill get proptosis cancer great im not sure if i wanna pick up dead cat headless baby its an okay pickup i should be able to kill mom theres like 350 items lots of bosses enemies synergiescharacterschallenges and it has a lot of replay value all that cool stuff you want in a video game the soundtrack is nice too,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,binding of isaac rebirth is a remake of binding of isaac with new graphics new mechanics new monsters new items and every aspect of the game has been enhanced new content has been added everywhere possible the game feels infinitely smoother is so much nicer to play and has many more hours of content to keep you satisfied for longer if you enjoyed the original binding of isaac binding of isaac rebirth is going to be infinitely better and i can promise instant satisfaction this review will consist of comparisons between the original and rebirth whats good whats bad possible changes and just an overall look at various aspects of the game including everything that comes to mind it is often a bit rambly because i talk extensively about every detail i like and every component that irks me for a full recommendation of the game and a continuation of the review visit the last paragraph a basic introduction to binding of isaac overall is an attempt to run away from your mother who is trying to kill you you run into the basement where you find various items which can be beneficial harmful or simply useless to your overall goal of surviving you shoot the enemies with your tears to kill them while running away from them and their tears to avoid taking damage once you die that run is over the game is permadeath so you have to start again from scratch the game is also absolutely disgusting there isnt too much blood but knowing that these monsters have lived in your dusty old basement been transformed into ugly mutilated creatures and that this is what becomes of you as you take pills and pick up items is gross once you get past the horrid enemies the game is pretty simple and is extremely fun to all who like the challenge of a game like this this game has a bunch of different characters all of which have different unique aspects some characters are easier to play than others which in the eyes of many people makes those characters more fun i wish the characters were more balanced but its very rarely possible to have 10 different characters you can play as that all play with equal difficulty there are bound to be some easier more fun and more interesting characters and thats what makes them unique something thats missing from the classes however is all the characters being unique some of the playstyles of the characters feel too similar and some of the things that made characters unique in the original binding of isaac have disappeared in rebirth samson no longer starts with a soul heart along with 1 red heart an interesting aspect of samson that made him a challenge in the original game rather he starts with 3 red hearts probably to accompany the change in the item of bloody lust making it a damage output increase relative to the amount of damage taken for the entire floor this is an interesting change but it makes samson more of a tanky character similar to magdalene rather than the weaker character with more potential i believe a better change would have been to give samson a spacebar item and keep his stats the same as they are in the original and the effect of bloody lust relative to the amount of kills you get while still maintaining its effect over the floor lucky foot the item that made cain a fun character to play in the original has been significantly nerfed making cain a character that lacks a truly unique aspect while lucky foot is still a luck up a single luck increase does not have much of an effect as most items that use luck to work require a lot of it to work extremely well if the lucky foot could still make the fortune machine work all the time or at least most of the time and increase the luck stat by multiple points rather than just one cain would be a much more interesting character to play and much more unique a good addition to rebirth is that all the stats are finally given good use and are recorded the luck stat is used in everything it should with a bunch of items now using the luck stat to perform more efficiently all methods of gambling in the game being affected by luck and it now being shown on the pause screen when you press escape theyve also shown all the stats including shot speed and luck as previously mentioned on the pause screen which were not there in the original game there are some enemies in the game that have been made impossible to fight bloat is a boss that shoots brimstone like lasers out of his eyes which wasnt too bad in the original but in this game there is no tell something that means hes going to do a certain attack for when he is going to shoot it and before you can move out of the way there is a laser and youve been hit the same thing applies to the lumps in the womb and the mom eyes in the red champion mom fight which shoot instantly upon popping up and you have no time to react to the high speed shot there are a lot of enemies that do similar things and still a lot of rooms remain where its almost impossible to leave without taking damage something i noticed thats new in rebirth is that everything from the original now has an equivalent every form of flyrelated enemy now has a spider version that does the same thing and a lot of similar aspects like that it makes the game more uniform because now there are a lot more interesting spiders which were missing from the original game and a lot of new versions of both flies and spiders which add a lot to the challenge of learning new elements of the game easily one of the best new additions in rebirth is the ability to save your progress in a run you can stop it at any time close the game and start again from where you left off at a later point you cant start another run while in the middle of a previous one without overriding the previous runs data but its still an extremely useful feature since in the previous game we had to leave the game running to continue a round of boi one of the more fun new additions is rooms of varying sizes they arent anything like a random size but they can now be a single normal room as all the rooms were in the original boi they can be double rooms extended either horizontally or vertically and they can even be quadruple rooms that extend in both directions the animation for travelling through such rooms can apparently cause motion sickness and it can be turned off by changing something in one of the files im not quite sure what personally i quite like the animation and it makes moving around large rooms extremely fun overall this game is easily worth the 15 if you liked the original binding of isaac and at the time of the making of this review there was no dlc released if there ever will be any so that might be added in the future this is an action packed permadeath roguelike with infinite replayability and hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock all the achievements and secrets as steam limits the size of community reviews you can find the rest of my review here 1drvms in the rest of the review i go over synergies chainedboarded rooms ludovico technique boss rush rooms multiplayer,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,1 and it came to pass after these things that edmund mcmillen did tempt gamers and said unto them gamers and he said behold here i am 2 and he said take now thy cash thine only cash till next pay period whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of steam or sony and offer it there for 10 to 15 usd dependent upon loyalty discount offering upon one of the consoles which i will tell thee of 3 and the gamers rose up early in the morning and saddled their honda civics and took two new taco bell breakfast crunchwraps and their cash and rose up and went unto the place of which edmund had told them 4 then on what felt like the billionth day the gamers lifted up their eyes and saw the place afar off 5 and they said unto their crunchwraps abide ye here with the honda civics and i and the cash will go yonder and worship and come again to you 6 and the gamers took their cash and they went both of them together 7 and the cash spake unto the gamers their owners and said my owners and they said here am i my cash and he said behold the cart full but where is the cash for offering 8 and the gamers said my cash edmund mcmillen will provide himself cash for an offering so they went both of them together because mediums of exchange are incapable of critical thinking 9 and they came to the place which edmund had told them of and the gamers chilled there and placed the order and bound their cash and laid him on the altar of purchase 10 and the gamers stretched forth their hands and inched their cursors towards confirmation 11 and tyrone rodriguez called unto gamers out of nicalis and said gamers gamers and he said here am i 12 and he said lay not thine hand upon the cash neither do thou any thing unto it for now i know that thou fearest cancellation seeing thou hast not withheld thy cash thine only cash for this pay period 13 and the gamers lifted up their eyes and looked and behold behind him a northern lion and the gamers went and took the northern lion and criticized him for taking moms knife in stead of their cash 14 and the gamers called that game rebirth as it is said to this day in the mount of indie it shall be seen the binding of isaac released back in 2011 is a roguelike indie darling that wears its zelda influences on its sleeves you play as isaac a young boy living with his mother his mother convinced she is being spoken to by god must offer isaac up to prove her love and devotion to him isaac in an understandable act of defiant selfinterest descends into the basement to escape its there that the game begins you fight all manner of monstrosities down below ranging from hideous pin worms cleftlipped disembodied heads physical manifestations of the seven deadly sins and the horsemen of the apocalypse you start fighting the denizens of your basement with your tears yes this game is a strange one but as you progress youll find unlockables in stores treasure rooms arcades etc that change your tear effects sometimes drastically and sometimes your appearance to win you have to juggle health bombs keys and money youll have to find secret rooms and secreter rooms and of course youll have to fight well i wont spoil that suffice it to say youll have some options as you play succeed and succumb youll unlock items and characters for each subsequent playthrough on top of that items you find and unlock enemies you encounter and floor layouts all change with each descent effectively making every run unique the binding of isaac is one of the most highly replayable games around with many players logging in hundreds if not thousands of hours its a troubling trend lately that games have been getting the hd rerelease treatment so quickly after initial launch the last of us tomb raider sleeping dogs metro all have come out recently all have had rereleases in fairly quick succession its no secret that gamers are suckers for a good dose of nostalgia and that were willing to pay top dollar for games we loved years ago that havent necessarily weathered the passing of time so well now publishers are testing gaming goodwill with the constant stream of hd ports definitive editions remasters and remakes its been three years since isaacs first appearance and now hes back in the binding of isaac rebirth and just like way back in 2011 when he first burst onto the scene hes stolen the show yet again ive explained the core mechanics and features of the game in a previous paragraph so i wont get all redundant on you instead ill tell you whats new in rebirth new enemies regular and boss types new floor layouts bigger floors new items new trinkets items you carry with you that result in an effect pink eye gives you poison shots cancer increases number of tears etc new challenge runs more item synergies more characters to play as seeds that allow you to choose a particular run hard mode for you masochists couch drop indrop out coop ingeniously designed where a second player can take health from the first player and becomes a unique familiar providing backup until death as long as you have health to spare you can respawn controller support new soundtrack from matthias bossi and jon evans more secrets the ability to save chocolate s okay not that last bit i could go on needless to say they took the binding of isaac and its dlc wrath of the lamb and compiled it into a single rerelease then they went and gave it a new splash of paint and hundreds of hours of content graphics are spectacular and detailed the style is lovingly zelda inspired the music is fresh and exhilarating enemies pop upon death viscerally gratifying its truly a delight if i have a minor niggle its that rebirth feels kind of floaty compared to vanilla isaac a little too fast but that just might take some getting used to it certainly hasnt deterred me for players old and new rebirth is at once familiar and exotic and i predict that regardless of prior experience with isaac youll find yourself experiencing some gaming de ja vu it really truly is a gamers game a loving homage to why we picked up controllers in the first place but half the fun my uninitiated friends is discovering all this for yourselves the bosses and tactics required to take them down the items the secrets its a challenging game i wont sugarcoat it but pressing forward and beating that first boss getting to a new level glimpsing the final boss all of these milestones are as rewarding as gaming experience get period and once you start at it you wont stop thats what those save files are for this is the indie game of the year this is the only indie title you really need to buy in 2014 for fans of the series for those unfamiliar for sentient animals and for any extraterrestrials and apparitions within earshot you owe it to yourself to buy this a title retro and modern all at once this puts all of those hd rereleases definitive editions and remakes to shame this is truly a rebirth for indie games for players for devs and publishers for gaming the bar has been raised so what are you waiting for repent every one of you in the name of rngesus for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of rebirth,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,after 2000 hours played with a few hundred on the original flash version i guess i should write a review this is a good game i think you should buy it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,i love this game alot it completely blows the original out of the water heres some proscons pros more playable characters more bosses more items 8 billion seeded runs better mechanics a whole load of bug fixes a massive amount of playtime new challenges boss rush 16 endings easier to break gt cons the keeper in all seriousness this is one of my favourite games of all time fantastic active and passionate community northernlions videos are what keeps me warm at night incredible fun highly recommended,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,disclaimer this game has a steep learning curve the basis of this game is knowledge the community spreads their knowledge almost making a meta the binding of isaac is a very fun game for me and i love its art style that being said here are some pros and cons pros 1 precise gameplay in terms of movement shooting and the bullet hell aspects 2 wide variety of bosses 3 randomized everything 4 great soundtrack 5 wide variety of characters 6 with afterbirth interesting greed mode with cool final boss 7 great community cons 1 very hard to memorize what item does maybe its just me idk 2 ouch alot of bullet hell aspects im bad at those anyway the cons are pretty much because those are my personal issues with it believe me if you want replayability and a good game to stream play through blind then this is it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,i played it just a little bit i think it is ok 6910 best game for eternity,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,if you enoyed the binding of isaac you will absolutely love this game boi was one of my favourite games from the past few years and i never thought it could be so much better well it is rebirth takes the addictive formula from the flash version of boiwotl and made it even more satisfying and addictive this time the controls are so smooth the graphics are spot on and you can tell how much love was put into this game i simply cannot put this game down and i highly recommend picking this game up it is worth every single penny updated for steam awards i nominated boir for the just 5 more minutes awards because everytime i play i find it hard to stop and one more run wouldnt hurt ends up being 5 hours,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,an excellent game that teaches good christian values for todays youths,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,ok heres a real review now i havent played the first game that much but i could already see all of the great improvements pros its not laggy you can see the enemies easier its easier to hear that you got hurt a lot more items more characters music is higher quality overall better performance improved animations if you need to leave to go somewhere you can save by just quitting multiple save files so if you share your steam with someone or just want to restart without losing progress you can do so cons memes there are still memes 1010,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,after playing this for a little while it already blows away all my expectations as someone that has 500 hours in the original they were very high to begin with the music is fantastic i still cant get over it you have a difficulty option now you can chose to play on normal or hard this is great as when you played the first sometimes it got too easy with everything unlocked you have save files now and can resume a run where you left off no more leaving the game running for hours as you go to the store full controller support dunno about a lot of different controllers but it works flawlessly with an xbox 360 controller you have a lot of new exciting items and powerups things that were never possible in the first more challenges different room sizes and types the list goes on i had very high hopes for this and already this gets everything right even better than i had expected in the first place this is a must even if you didnt like the first binding of isaac since it fixes a lot of issues that most people had with the first highly recommended 1010,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the finding of items restart,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebirth is a remastering of the original 2011 binding of isaac in short the game play hearkens back to old school topdown 16bit games the most notable and recognizable being the legend of zelda titles for inspiration in essence the binding of isaac rebirth is a rougelike rpg where you play as isaac or one of the other unlockable characters and you must traverse the basement of your house to escape the wrath of your mother who hears from the voice of god and is told that you must be sacrificed this premise sets the tone of the game being very creepy and unsettling as you defend against all manners of your lost brothers sisters creatures and other grotesque monstrosities eventually leading to a showdown with your own mother as well and even beyond that if you get good at the game and carry on what makes the binding the isaac such a great title comes from its solid game play elements the game play itself is very easy to understand at first but becomes very deep with the inclusion of the upgrades via the roguelike elements easy to understand difficult to master luck of the draw permadeath isaac in a nutshell in order to get far into a run you will need upgrades and a lot of them isaac by default will only be able to fire his tears at the enemies in only the four cardinal directions but many different upgrades can alter his tears or give them new effects this is what can make or break a run in binding of isaac be warned not all the upgrades are positive which adds to the roguelike elements as some are ultimately poor or are only used in certain situations and can ruin a run resulting in failure high risk and high reward situations are the nature of the game it is the element of luck the drives you to start up another run see what upgrades and item combinations you will encounter each time in this remastering of binding of isaac there is the heavy emphasis on itemupgrade synergy coming across interesting item combinations and seeing how they interact with one another can create those overpowered moments brimstone plus tammys head for example creates a short brimstone shots in all directions when tammys head is used that make you feel like a god within the game or create a silly combination where you have to work twice as hard just to clear a room so what if you already have played the original binding of isaac what should you expect this time around in the remastering in short a lot more when compared with the original more items and upgrades have introduced into the item pool new bosses and enemies to encounter for better or worse a whole new art style very reminiscent of gameboy advance titles pixel art style with a pixel smoother option in the options menu for those who prefer not to look at rigid pixels seeded run options 2player local coop play controller support with analog stick integration new soundtrack three save slots new lighting effects and well just more to be honest the sheer amount that was added to the game is staggering when compared to the original even at the 15 usd price it still feels well worth the investment you can get several hours in just from doing a few runs and seeing how far you will get and what crazy item combinations you will come across or what new itemscharacters you will unlock for later runs it is a challenging game no doubt but i will admit that having one of those moments where you just barely defeat final boss of your run with only one health bar left is nothing short of gratifying if you have any slight interest in the roguelike genre this is genuinely a great title to try and own worth it yes if on sale no question yes available on steam pcmaclinux ps4 psvita,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,so this game is a remake the binding of isaac released in 2011i dont want to write a lot so i will just wrte and isaac is back 4 new unlockable characters new rooms pixel graphics for pixel haters there is a filter lots of new items new effects new enemies new challenges new endings and more new stuff in fullscreen game is too zoomed in some bosses and enemies are worse the they were in original music new soundtrack is ok but nobody will make as perfect indie game music as danny so if you like the best indie games buy it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this game man itll make you feel like a god as much as itll make you feel like a onelegged homeless man who has wet himself buy it its incredible,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the game where the devil also accepts your credit card 1010,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,finally a game with good christian values,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,more content stability variety rooms monsters joyfully difficult interesting small world of misery hard to find anything bad game was just in development for long enough to be perfectly finished works nice both for short time killing and for long grinding,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,id appreciate it if you checked out my blog where i do reviews giveaways and more httpsgandhigamingwordpresscom binding of isaac is one of my best purchases on steam 5 for hundreds of hours attempting to get at moms heart again and again with randomly generated rooms and items really whats not to like to this day i still play it and enjoy watching myself suffer the consequences of trying to kill gurdy jr with rebirth out it should be no surprise that i pick this game up honestly it took a little while but i think rebirth lived up to the hype close call mcmillen graphics,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the original binding of isaac was released back in 2011 and was pretty much the effort of two or three people the game on a chronically horrible flash interface the original is still pretty great however comparing the original and the remastered binding of isaac is like the difference between a regular membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard you wont notice the difference immediately but it will stick in your mind if you go back to the original rebirth plays much better in comparison via subtle changes to the formula the main differences between the original and the remastered edition include 160 new items native gamepad support thank jebus a new set of gameplay and difficulty tweaks hard mode being a big tweak for cool kids who like to unlock more things on top of their already unlocked things and the game engine running at 60fps all times every times except when you alttab to something else ive noticed but im not going to hit the developers for that its a worthy addition to a classic and i dont know if i can go back to playing the original now since this supercedes it by a mile honestly the only people i imagine who would complain about this are frustrated teenagers who dont get allowances and those awful pedantic s on steam who use the forums to complain about refunds every time the preorders dont get released on time,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,ive got nearly 400 hours on the original binding of isaac when i preordered rebirth it felt almost obligatory it had so much to live up to my thought process was well im sure ill at least get my moneys worth and that guy is welcome to some more of my money after the cost vs enjoyment of the original it is probably even better than the original ill rack up hundreds of hours on this one too im sure the game is cleaner and faster you dont get shot in the foot by randoming the wrong items and you can continue your game so now if youre in the middle of a good play and someone is like hey lets go out to dinner you dont have to just leave the game running the entire time youre gone so yeah recommend,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,great improvment from the original i dont see anything that the original has over this game other than like 2 songs pros better graphics better soundtrack for the most part more fps more characters bosses items floors etc more synergies many more that i cant think of cons the lost,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this game has enough content to keep you going for weeks if not months just to reach 100 and even after that youre stuck with a beatiful fun endlessly replayable game that runs at silkysmooth 60fps on almost any machine that said the game can and will kick your butt hard if youre not paying attention to what youre doing however if you can play your cards right sometimes literally you can own the game and become death the destroyer of floors if you enjoyed even a slight bit of the original youll be in love with the new game and lets not forget that the soundtrack is simply wicked in all senses of the word,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebirth a remake of the flash game made by edmund mcmillen a game ive been anticipating for a very long time everyone who doesnt have it might be wondering if it live up to the hype is it better than the original is it a good game at all absolutely rebirth is an improvement on the original isaac in every single way imaginable the art style the gameplay controller support save files everything you can think of is better in rebirth its absolutely one of the best games ive ever played and its only been 2 days the game is everything i expected it to be and more i cant say enough about how much of a pleasure it is to play this game the original brought me into the genre of the roguelikelite and this one draws me in even more with all the incredible items and synergys ive heard people complain about the soundtrack i really dont understand why its much better in my opinion its more of a background ambient sound rather than an in your face track and i find that fits this game incredibly well the arcade and boss music is especially good the only complaint that ive had issue with is keyboard problems occasionally but its so minor and rarely affects anything at least for me rebirth is truely one of the best games ive played and will probably be my game of the year what are you waiting for go pick up rebirth and play the best rougelike to date buy at full price,1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,its fair to say that binding of isaac afterbirth is my favourite game since i invested a few hours into it with this being said i wont review it because my opinion will obviously influence my review i will critique it using the concepts written by ernest adams and joris dormans in the book game mechanics advanced game design the authors came up with five concepts that players should find in every game these are physics internal economy progression mechanisms tactical maneuvering and social interaction physics,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,after spending hundreds of hours in the original binding of isaac i was pretty sceptical about rebirth to be honest i didnt expect it to have the same impact but i was proven wrong sooooo wrong after the first few minutes i got hooked again and cant stop playing since more items sick synergies fun and creative challenges coop great graphics great new soundtrack and smooth gameplay no more slowdowns caused by the crappy flash engine the only downside at this moment are some minor bugs however if youre looking for a reason for not get rebirth heres one after playing rebirth for the first time the original binding of isaac will become a waste of space in your library since you never ever gonna thouch it again,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,better than advanced warfare,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,its alright,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,even more addictive than the original binding of isaac,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,its ok i guess only play it now and again,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this game is like bdsm at first its really painful and you hate it but after a while you start to like it and eventually really enjoy it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebirth is everything you could want from an action roguelike its fun has a ton of features its addictive and has a huge replay value with 450 items and 4 billion seeded runs youll play the game for years and years and will always see something new each playthrough this is my first time playing tboi and i loved it i cant recommend enough see you in the basement,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebith where do i even start pros infinite replayability you can play this over and over again and never find the same floor layout same items same enemies creativity the game has items ranging from satanic headless babies leeking blood to damage enemies to a glass of milk that spills when you take damage enemies ranging from deformed children with bombs implanted in their heads to demon versions of isaac that mimic his every move characters that range from a laserfiring demon to a glass cannon disguised with a fez and bosses that range from a large poop to mega satan fcking mega satan items the items can sometimes be bad which gives the game a nice balance sometimes youll pick up an item that makes you jesus and other times youll pick up an item that makes you want to restart the run even if youre right about to beat the boss enemies the enemies are very challenging and annoying sometimes but if you know how to take them out you can very efficiently power your way through rooms and floors murdering everything in your wake but if you dont know how to beat them youll get eaten by a tiny baby spider bosses the bosses can be really annoying sometimes other times challenging and occassionally pushovers the bosses all over all are very creatively designed too as mentioned above in the creativity section so much fun this game has kept me entertained for hours and im still nowhere close to being done especially after purchasing the dlc i could see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours and never getting bored afterbirth the one and only dlc for isaac is a doozy adding plenty of new items enemies room layoutssizes bosses and hours of gameplay to the mix it even adds a new gamemode and overall makes the game harder so only get it if you want an extra challenge cons sound this may just be my computer but ive always had a problem with the sound its extremely loud even if i only have it one notch up difficulty the game can be quite challenging at times and although that adds to the overall charm of the game i feel it could be toned down a notch without negative effect overwhelming as a new player the amount of content in the game can overwhelm you i practically live on the isaac wiki while playing and ive played for a while with how many items there are you wont know what a lot of them do until youve played the game for a while characters there are certain characters in the game that seem very overpowered cough azazel cough i feel like this throws off the balance a lot as many will play azazel for a long time and beat everything with him and then theyll move on to another character and be extremely unprepared for playing the other characters who compared to azazel can be quite challenging to use thank you all for reading my review and i really hope it helps you make your decision about purchasing this amazing game,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,now heres the deal you have rerelease upadated release is probably the closest thing you can call this here it costs three times more than the original without counting dlc wrath of the lamb question is is it any worth oh yeah its absolutely worth of all the pennies i paid from it super smooth due new engine it works very smoothly fantastic local coop havent tried but its always a plus new items amp item combinations be creative break the game for your benefit new enemies amp bosses more blood to splatter normal and hard modes true i havent tried hard yet but for more hardcore group of players it must mean something right more characters more reasons to play play as eden who has all stats and items randomed and so much more animated cutscenes more bodyhorror the only thing which so far isnt as good as in original isaac is soundtrack in my opinion however its not that bad either now that ive played rebirth more and it definitely fits here i just find baranowskys soundtrack much more enjoyable points on music playing in arcade though and for recommendation part its bit tricky chances that you loved original isaac you already own this chances are that if you didnt care for original isaac you really dont care about this either but new to roguelike genre theres no finer way to introduce yourself to the genre than this game and now back to the basement kids,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this game makes original isaac look like a prealpha stage of this game yes its that good,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the hardest bosses cant hit me but a nonmoving object kills me 1010 okay seriously though i love this game if you like rougelikes and you have not purchased this game yet please do this is one of the games that makes me believe quality content is still a thing in the video game industry great devs great community great moments,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the pixel art is amazing the gameplay is amazing the music though not as good as danny bs soundtrack from the original is amazing the replayability ist amazing this game is just amazing,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,substantially better than its predecessor the binding of isaac rebirth is what you think of when a game lives up to its hype the creatorsedmund mcmillen and nicalishave done a great job of designing not only a great remake of the original but a great game worthy of its own merit you should think less of rebirth as a remake and more of it as a pseudosequel that just happens to have all of the original content a la the pokemon franchise for a similar experience the gameplay which is a dungeoncrawling twinstick shooter just like the original has enough variety that every run will be different theres permanent death in the game so be warnedthe game is difficult and you will die but your overarching progress will be saved thats part of the draw for a lot of the community since you start from scratch with each 30 minute to 1 hour run all in all i cant recommend this game enough and if youre a fan of the original you will most likely adore this one my pick for game of the year for 2014,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this is the game you you have been waiting for the game where you want cancer the game where you mutilate your own body so you cry more the game where you can vomit blood to kill your enemies these enemies include the devil himself your own mother angels yourself your own rotted corpse babies that got lost a fetus a fly items that youll want blood clot cancer and a bunch of ed up eye diseases items youll hate bobs brain cursed eye and a bunch of useless ing beans this game is honestly amazing i mean you spend about 100 hours geting the hang of it and then about 400 playing seriously though surely any game where you summon the devil kill him in one hit and step back to admire yur work but walk into a fly and die should be the game you want 1010 never take bobs brain seriously i have like 300 hours and bobs brain kills me 99 of the time youll see,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac is on its surface a rather childish narrative of poop jokes and weird body horror but upon further reflection and piecing together of the nonlinear story one comes to realize that isaac is a wholly unique fairly depressing and highly important narrative isaac is a child with everything stripped from him his ability to choose his ability to move around his very humanity is offered up in the name of sacrifice but unlike so many other narratives about child abuse isaac is a game that does not end with a child falling to the knife of his authoritative figures but rather making his own choices whether to live or to die isaacs struggles are given serious attention even amidst all the giant poop monsters and i truly believe this game can absolutely be a cathartic experience to some of us out there who maybe didnt always have the chance to make our own fight in life,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,a perfect example of the roguelike genre isaac meshes an interesting and abstract story with tight fun gameplay the replay value is beyond enormous with hundreds of unlockables a graphical nod to the legend of zelda helps the fantastic pixel art shine ive played this game hundreds of times and dont regret a single nanosecond,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,its alright i guess,1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,1010 i love the ost but ill get to that in a minute the game itself was done perfectly its remade exactly how i would want gameplay is so smooth its beautiful and it has all the content from the original and wrath more this is exactly how i want to play the game and im glad i stopped playing boi to wait for this now on to the ost i think the issue is that the danny b soundtrack just fit the game so well i think it was nearly a fluke how the music just gave you that extra sense of being creeped out and feeling bad for the denizens of the basement and below sure hes ultra talented and im sure he set out for the creepy vibe but who would have thought how perfectly it would set the mood for the game for me the music would actually trigger an emotion to what i was seeingthinking about these poor kids down there having to live in their own feces getting sick forming growths and turning into monsters it actually made me feel a bit ill and disturbed im not sure if thats good or bad but its certainly rare in both games and film to accomplish that basically i think if it wasnt for the original ost people would be amazed with the new one its awesome but you cant recapture completely what the first one did it comes damn close though,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,after 50 hours of this game i have to come to a conclusion that this game is amazing pros amazing soundtrack tons of new items new characters new bosses new enemies great playback experience long game cons luck few bugs i would say this is a must get game if you are looking for an endless fun indie game,1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,killed mega satan with chocolate milk 1110 would be an abused child again,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,isaac has some problems in his family his mother watching a religious tv program decided to kill her son in sacrifice to god the kid managed to jump into the basement a network of catacombs densely populated by a huge amount of monsters and the only weapon he has are his tears in the binding of isaac rebirth you clean room by room collect bonuses find hidden places and shops and then defeat the boss and jump into the next door in the floor a new level begins and it gets harder and harder you do so a few times before meeting his mother then satan himself or someone else the binding of isaac is challenging really difficult the farther you get the easier it is to die and then you have to start from the very beginning but there are many items which help you to become stronger so many that i even used the isaac wiki to get the full understanding of every item and situation in the game it really helps one item teaches isaac to jump finally other causes tears or enemies to explode and hurt everyone around you can upgrade your max hp hearts the devil will sometimes reward you with the power of the dark side wings and other strong abilities for some of your hearts the style of play often changes radically in the middle of the race you just scribbled tears in different directions hardly finishing even the smallest creep and then you suddenly get a powerup that changes your whole gameplay and you kill even the hardest boss without any problems but the thing is it can be the other way round too it is also always interesting to see how every item affects isaac because every item changes his appearance so each time he looks different he acquires tumors horns or a bloody grin pulls moms bra on his head or something else failure is a part of the process play die start again play die again but every time we get something new achievements open new items so you do not want to stop completely rebirth added a lot of new enemies bosses items and secrets if you compare it with the original game and this is good edmund mcmillen and his colleagues made an excellent job a game full of the most horrible fears bitter tears of childhood and exciting ideas you can also play it with you friend locally but its not the local multiplayer youd expect instead of a full second hero your partner takes control of a little ghost accompanying isaac it cant go through doors or pick up items it can only help to do more dmg i would like more although it is not clear how anything else would fit into the current mechanics so all in all this game is really fantastic 1010 ps there will be a new dlc soon im definitely waiting for it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,1 start a new run 2 restart until the treasure room is next to your spawn 3 take a look inside the treasure room 4 if item good playercontinueplaying else playerrestart,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,its literally the poopiest game ever native controller support nice graphic huge amount of new items to find i shed so many tears 60fps edit it deserves a steam award,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this remake is a complete master piece enjoyable challenging and most importantly loads of easter eggs,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,so the new isaac reboot is up and running and im enjoying it so far im still learning a lot but i guess imma leave my early impressions here and ill generally just review the binding of isaac as a whole scratch that i got real plat god and i think its time for me to update this small list a little bit the good high ammount of fun items and combinations great soundtrack dark undertone that manages to also keep a sense of humor hours of play solid combat amp gameplay in general overall endless variety that isnt so present in most randomly generated games the bad flash filter doesnt do the trick of making the game look like flash rng can make it really hard to unlock or get certain items see lvl 4 meatboy a ridiculously and artifial ammount of stuff required to 100 the game see the lost some room layouts are designed to you off things that can be considered both good or bad depending on opinions rougelike a lot of luck comes into play randomly generated better pray to rngesus toilet humour sometimes doesnt tell you stuff what to do what an item does etc so thats what im thinking of rebirth so far if you like a game about luck and charm and just generally want to kill disgusting abominations with your tears on a fecesriddled basement or you like rougelikes or you liked the dungeons in the orignal zelda game or if you just want a darn fun and unique game then oh boy is the binding of isaac rebirth a good choice for you otherwise dont bother,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,call of duty basement warfare is a masterfully crafted commentary on the degradation of societys morals the main character captain soap price callsign isaac is on a mission to tackle the deeprooted fears that all humans have of ungodly things such as poop and basements taking a bold step away from a tried and true formula codbw is no longer a first person shooter players do not play as a badass soldier anymore either in order to connect with the fanbase on a more personal level the head of nintendo decided that codbw would place players in the shoes of the average call of duty player a naked child who hates their mother but s mine all the time apparently however what is most surprising about this cod is the lovely message that the campaign has by tackling his fears head on he dies meaning he cant be afraid anymorethats some a ernest hemingway right there folks thanks to isaac being a mix of wolverine and dr evil however he can try to kill his mother over and over until he succeeds and gets her to listen to his mixtape this has the notsounexpected result of killing his mom again seriously off with your mixtapes as you can tell by the pros and cons that ive listed above this game should be goty 20152020 remember kids if you throw poop and shoot eyeball sperm at your own mother the devil spits in gods face,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,i loved the original so of course i love rebirth it adds so much content to the game theres a lot of rng but there are quite a few things you can use to your advantage in order to turn a bad run around in your favor i also appreciate the relatively short amount of time it takes to complete or fail a run some roguelikes can take hours which makes failing so much more frustrating my complete isaac runs average around 4050 minutes a piece,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,word of advice kids if you find pills in your basement go ahead and take them they might make you cry faster domestic abuse 10,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,even someone with a little exposure to the old testament should recognize this tale of the same name in the biblical tale of binding of isaac god tests abraham by commanding him to prove his devotion to him to do this he must sacrifice his son isaac just as abraham is about to end isaacs life god demands for abraham to stop and let his son live sacrificing a lamb instead christian religious symbols items and connotations saturate the binding of isaac game and yet the handling of such sensitive material is not mocking towards its inspiration and its not reverent instead its a fine line and one balanced masterfully only the most cynical christians and nonchristians will find anything to take offense over edmund mcmillen the up and coming indie superstar behind the rage inducing super meat boy has released his most fun and inspired game yet being the best topdown shooter doesnt hurt eitherbut im getting ahead of myself steam users most likely already know the sheer awesomeness that is the binding of isaac but who knew that was just a taste of what mr mcmillen had brewing up in his devilish head next to a slab of meat and bandages the binding of isaac rebirth feels like a remastered version of the original isaac with all of the content quadrupled like a triple fudge cake with chocolate frosting and a chocolate core made of chocolate icecreamat least i think its chocolate for those new to the game isaac at its heart is a topdown shooter that has borrowed so much from the 8bit zelda i get the feeling a nintendo lawsuit could be on its way at any moment for example keys drop from enemies to unlock doors and chests bombs are used to remove rocks and you gain more hearts as you progress through the stages in the basement with isaac are a motley crew of deformed monsters who look like they were torn from a childs nightmare and are now dragging the floor with their ripped tendons and ligaments isaac keeps the fiends at bay by flinging tears like spears even horribly deformed monsters dont like being exposed to ebola and other diseases by having bodily fluids flung at them and to top it off a massive boss resides at the end of the stage guarding its domain with a fierce tenacity isaac must maim and kill the beast so he can pass through to the next stage unmolested dont think tboi is just a crying simulator like dark souls isaac features roguelike elements which add random items which change nearly any and every game mechanic in some twisted incredible way the dungeons are different every trip through their dreary halls these stages will be braved many times and the variety keeps things fresh and challenging like a room with trip lasers and machinegun mounted turrents that change places every time you move out of their range the game mechanics are perfectly balanced adding to the fun of the game do you use your last precious bomb to free a key which will open the item room is that prized key worth the extra heart which may keep you alive during the next boss fight balanced risk reward scenarios such as these are what makes the game such a joy to play now lets talk about the elephant in the room or more accurately the elephant poo in the room look i dont know what edmund mcmillen was going through when developing isaac and im pretty sure i dont want to know for the fear of becoming psychologically scarred but there are a lota lot of piles of crap everywhere in nearly every room of every stage throughout the entire game there are poo monsters poo bosses poo powerups and even special piles of poo with unique properties its one thing to see isaac murder an enemy pull its heart out and devour it like jeffrey dahmer but its totally another to see him pull a heart out of a pile of poo and pop it in his mouth those are the kinds of things you dont want to see because the nightmares wont stop even after chats with your psychologist not all items are powerups though some will grab your balls wrap them around your neck and force you to finish the game that way its a gamble picking up an item you dont recognize which will happen often as there are more items in the game than pitfall deaths in super mario its like bobbing for apples in a tank filled with chocolate eggs apples and dead fish items themselves are like little people some will instantly tell you who they are and what they do but others will require you to notice whats changed or missing when you review your security footage its an homage to older games when the developers didnt explain anything about their little cartridge of frustration and expected gamers to figure things out on their own half the fun of isaac comes from discovering an innocent item hidden away only to find out later that it eats feces and likes to mouthkiss tboi is sort of like doing drugs at first youre just casually smoking a joint on the weekend with friends but before the moon passes many times youre laying in a buildings doorway begging for money and stealing from your family just to feed your fix once morealone and desperate with isaac playing a casual game here and there will do just fine after all you just want to beat the game but then it creeps up on you youll come so close just to have tboi laugh at your feeble attempts not to spoil too much but you cant just stop after the credits play it more let it fill your veins satisfying your cravings and curiosity if limitless playtime isnt enough there are bonus challenge levels which give you either a fun or debilitating set of items and task you with beating the game one may require you with beat the game in near total darkness except for a tiny light around your character others will give you a laser which kills everything in range like a mothers angry looks only the most skilled of the elite players will be able to complete everything here and are really a wellthought out and fun bonus in a game already packed full of content i dont mean to read too much into the meaning of the game but it seems to mirror the story of life youll have some good things and bad things happening to us but in the end youll go through a lot of for the first time ive not had real negative quibbles problems and complaints with a game even after looking under every rock and corpse thats as rare as finding a platinum cheerio in your cocoa puffs if you dont already own this game purchase it immediately before the bad sense police find you and toss you into a poofilled prison either way youre ending up in a poofilled prison might as well make it this

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,one of the best games around especially for the price the gameplay is like the dungeons in the original legend of zelda for the nes but its a good bit harder and you only have one life to do it all in if you die you start at the very beginning pretty much empty handed the levels and pickups are randomly generated so its a different game every time you play it even the bosses are randomly picked from a pool of possibilities and each boss has several different versions that range from easy to very tough theres a lot of variety here even though the game itself is simple and straightforward youll get many many quality hours out of this thing even if you already have the original this one improves almost everything its smoother prettier harder and theres a lot of new enemies and items that change the gameplay in significant ways the only thing i really miss about the original game is the soundtrack the new music is fine but i prefer the original score other than that this is one of my favorite games ever and ive played a whole lot of them,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,good for the casual player with not much time to devote to it,1,1
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebirth is a remake of the original binding of isaac the main difference with this version is the lack of mouse controls there are also an added 3 final bosses and 17 new normal bosses rebirth is a top down 2d dungeon crawler where the player controls isaac you venture through your mothers basement and then moving onto necropolis catacombs and even your mothers own womb rebirth also introduces local coop which is something i always like to see in games the dungeons look similar to that of legend of zelda and the procedurally generated levels means you will never have the same run twice in each dungeon room you must eliminate all of the enemies before being allowed to move onto the next room along the way players will collect money to buy equipment find keys which unlock treasure chests and find power ups and weapons to increase isaacss power once you reach the latter stages of rebirth the difficulty really ramps up and you will find yourself becoming very annoyed at yourself but somehow you cannot stop yourself from playing because isaac is such an addictive game you can complete a full run in isaac in about 45 minutes give or take a little so ive finished roughly 5 or 6 runs throughout my seven hours of playing and each run i am still unlocking new power ups characters and weapons to use in future runs basically if you dont have any binding of isaac games you need to pick up rebirth its everything the original game had but done a lot better this type of game you can pick up and play with ease do a quick run here and there and youll still have new things to find and explore if you found this review helpful please consider giving it a thumbs up you can also find more reviews over at httpwwwcompletingthebackloggroupcom httpstoresteampoweredcomapp250900,1,1

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,the binding of isaac rebirth or sometimes just called rebirth which i shall call it for this review is a rogue like rpg made by nicalis who made cave story remakes and a vvvvvv port under the supervision of edmund mcmillen that is a sequel to the 2011 game the binding of isaac made by edmund mcmillen and florian himsl rebirth unlike the original has much more content and much more replayability than the first game adding new enemies bosses items and characters for you to play with thanks to rebirth being made on a nonflash engine basically it is the original binding of isaac along with the dlc wrath of the lamb with much more smoother gameplay added features and even more things to find and experiment with the story is the same as in the original isaac and his mother are living alone in a house isaac playing with his toys like a normal kid would and his mother listening to christian broadcasts on the television however isaacs life takes a sudden turn for the worse when his mother starts hearing the voice of god himself saying that her son has been corrupted his mother who wants to cleanse isaac of all his sin takes all of isaacs belongings even the clothing on his back and locks him in his room shutting him out from the outside world however god wants isaacs mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing isaac so his mother grabs a kitchen knife and starts walking to isaacs room isaac in a state of panic starts to search around his room for a way out which he finds as a door to the basement just as isaacs mother bursts into the room isaac jumps into the dark abyss and that is where your game begins first off the graphics in rebirth are largely improved from the original having 16bit like graphics that make rebirth look more retro than a sequel although it looks 16bit once the player starts to move around and get into the game the game actually looks very smooth being made on a nonflash engine rebirth also runs very very smoothly even when there is a ton of enemies or items on the screen unlike in the original where having too many items on the screen would cause the game to lag or even crash all together gameplay wise rebirth plays very similarly to the original go around rooms kill enemies that spawn in the rooms pick up items upgrade your character and fight the boss on the floor then go to the next floor occasionally after beating a floor the player may find a new room before they go to the next floor that contains either a devil room or a angel room the devil room allows players to permenantly trade in their health containers for various items while the angel room gives the player a item for free however this game is not very forgiving so expect to die a lot not as much as dark souls but a pretty decent amount there are a ton of new items in the game that have many different effects as well as items from the original as you fight your way through your foes you may find money keys bombs health chests cards trinkets or even upgrade or reusable items for example one of the newer items chocolate milk allows you to charge up shots before releasing the direction you wish to fire your shot increasing its attack and shot size these items can actually synergize with one another causing very deadly combos that can make your run to defeat mom much more easier for example polyphemus which makes your shots much more damaging larger and be able to pass through enemies if the shot kills them in one hit if your damage rating is higher while reducing the fire rate of your tears combined with chocolate milk can make a incredibly large and much much more damaging much like the original every time you start up a new game all the items enemies and upgrades will be different it literally cannot be the same game twice however thanks to the new seed mode you can write down the seed of a run you have been doing input it when you start a new game and the map and all the upgrade room items will stay the same however doing this will disable any achievements you can earn for that run which unlocks more items for you to find the sound has also been redone and the music is pretty upbeat from the start of your adventures in basment 1 to the retro beats of the arcade to the intense boss battle music it makes you feel like you can actually make it to the end and beat mom enemies also have some new sounds as well as some more damage sounds when you get hurt overall binding of isaac rebirth is a major major improvement to the original and is worth every penny if you managed to read this far i highly suggest you play the game yourself and experience the struggles that is isaacs escape against mom,1,0
250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,game is very addictive gameplay and graphics already surpass the original issac by far i think the soundtrack from the original is better though overall though this may be goty material im also hoping that they make dlc for this game as well edit nevermind about the achievements there are actually a lot more achievements than the first game around 174 honestly i cant think of a better roguelike than this if you guys can really think of a better one then comment,1,0

252950,Rocket League,rocket league has one of the best progression systems ive ever seen in a video game before rookie you cant hit you are a disgrace to your team and the game semi pro you can now sometimes hit the ball dont even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning youre only semi pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball you also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah youre still pro you have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground youre the best late into pro level you would have likely looked up advanced tips for rocket league worst mistake of your life you now know what aerials are you think you can fly the ball comes up high and you go for an aerial once you jump you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back what the happened there oh youre using keyboard yeah nah time to get a controller head veteran you now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials you think youre good you can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team congratulations expert you can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height this game is now your life you can also score off a wall every now and then good times master you are now a god to every level lower than you you have perfected the art of wall shots you are an extremely cool person a nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of pro will now spam sorry every time they do something wrong to you legend the most badasslooking title you can have rocketeer you probably now have an extreme case of false confidence once you get used to the badass title youll wreck anything and anyone with ease you can also pull off freestyles consistently nice job also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of youre not good enough for legend rocketeer you can now 720freestylebackflipreversebackwardsaerialair dribble off a wall with ease you probably boosted for that rocketeer tag but if you didnt still prepare for another endless stream of youre not good enough for rocketeer but in all seriousness i absolutely love this game and im sure anyone will ive literally never seen someone dislike this game after theyve played 10 hours rocket league moves onto a wholenother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly if youre still contemplating buying this game after reading this review just trust me when i say it is one of the most fun and addictive games ive ever played more gripping than skyrim and gta think about it this way you wouldnt have made it this far through the review if you didnt secretly want this game ignore the childishlooking pictures on the store page just get this game this is the one edit 2132016,1,0

252950,Rocket League,hate football games hate car games love car football game i dont get it either,1,0
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is a perfect game for short breaks 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars then i can continue doing whatever i was doing before to be honest it usually ends up in one more match multiple times thats how its good the game is easy to learn and just fun to play making the perfect aerial shot passing to a goal saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment failing hard and scoring an own goal these are all moments you will see in rocket league are you in a mood for tactical game play 2v2 do you want chaos play 4v4 i love car customization who doesnt want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid479653619,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is less of a sports game and more of an actual sport in fifa or madden you have a pass button but to make a pass in rocket league you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going you have to create the pass yourself and it can be anything from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender passing shooting dribbling tackles jukes theyre all in the game but you have to make them happen yourself not just press the right button at first just driving car to ball is a challenge but as your skill grows the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything youll find in a sports game together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball youll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense there are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours that can keep challenging you as you improve and improve and improve beyond what you ever imagined youd be capable of in fact this is the only one i know best game ever,1,1
252950,Rocket League,why is rocket league a great game for you pro great gameplay very competitive matchmaking 1vs12vs23vs3 easy to pick up and a hard way to master good graphics cool dlcs con sometimes a bad server connection i like rocket league and i highly recommend it i hope there add alot of free dlcs 1010,1,1

252950,Rocket League,edited as of 21st july 2015 0100 pros its a footballsoccer game that contains rocket powered cars added soccer because of americans it is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters in my experience my game seems to run at a stable 60fps after turning off the frame limiter graphics looking quite nice pc ps4 cross play is possible its easy to learn impossible to master ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match there are a lot of friendly players in the steam community save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor full xbox 360xbox one controller support cons ps4 pc cross parties are currently nonexistant you can unlock a lot of things in such a small time im level 2030 and i have 100 of the items some people have crashing issues mainly nvidia driver issues i run amd so i do not have these issues myself lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same you cannot communicate to ps4 players except for a small amount of predetermined chat commands voice codec is rather terrible so advice is to use out of game communication middle servers are pretty much sorted now the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though currently no spectator system no peer to peer so even private matches require servers to be up 4v4 is the limit some people see that as good some as bad any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executable that is as fair as i can be to it if i missed anything out tell me tldr i think its a good game from my experience d get the game here edit 1 thanks to everyone for voting this to be the most helpful review for rocket league to thank everyone have this as a reward reward wwwomfgdogscom have a great day guys d for those of you who asked for my pc specs they can be found here ukpcpartpickercom edit 2 last of all shameless plug for my rocket league group you should totally join if you own the game because why not lets play some games join here lets party boysgirls we got all night,1,1

252950,Rocket League,this is what you get when ea isnt involved in game developing,1,0
252950,Rocket League,if youre even just slightly interested in arcade racing games andor football then you should check this outwell actually even if youre not in rocket league youre playing football or soccer with cars with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump which can make for some great moves and aerial shots you can choose from 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 matches so its nowhere near as much players as in real football but thats actually a good thing even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaoticthen again that can be fun as well its rather easy to get into the game as you have tutorial for the basics like handling your booster doing aerial shots defense etc but that doesnt mean there is no challenge to do those insane aerial maneuvers youll need quite some training the main motivation comes from being a competitive game either via ranked games or normal matches against other players there is also a singleplayer mode but thats more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game you can also unlock stuff for your car like hats booster color tires and patterns to put onto your car ive never been a big fan of either genre yet rocket league manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play even if youre playing with random people its not that bad and you can have quite some fun though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun so hope to see some of you on the field,1,1
252950,Rocket League,500 hours in and still finding new things to learn easy game to pickup stupidly hard to master cant recomend this game enough nice shot what a save,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i received rocket league from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting following that i proceeded to play with him and some other friends but we suckedbad 600 logged hours later i am in the top 1 of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things or made a few different moves you could have done much much better it is a fast paced game where the idea of the game is simple the controls are exceptional for real the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should the skill cap is insanely high every single time the ball goes in the air you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of it rocket league is the type of game that i can pickup for a few games and put back down or i can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes i had last game psyonix the developer knows how to run this game they are constantly pushing out new updates patches and content most of which is free they allow you to customize your vehicles so no two are the same or you and some friends can team up create the exact same cars then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans psyonix really thought of everything with rocket league and they keep adding more and more great content allinall rocket league is a great game cannot recommend it enough and is totally worth even up to a price of 60 even though i got it for free so have fun in rocket league work your way to the top and calculated calculated calculated,1,1

252950,Rocket League,rocket league is an excellent game and one of my favourites its very easy to understand but hard to master optimisation is great and graphics also is fantastic the game also has full controller support but you can play with mouse and keyboard as well so its up to you how you want to play i more prefer the controller after the first launch of the game you will hear a fantastic music on the menu after that you can choose your car play tutorial and finally you will be able to play your first game on multiplayer in the game there are a lot of cars and you can also buy paid dlcs cars from dlcs are technically the same the only differences are hit boxes according to developers all of the cars have the same stats vehicles are customisable for example you can add an antenna change your wheels colour of the car etc like i wrote above rocket league is very easy to understand because in the main mode the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score to put it simply its just football with cars you can choose between 1vs1 2vs2 3vs3 and 4vs4 the main modes are playable on casual and competitive types of the game but there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey basketball and my personal favourite rumble in rumble rules are the same but here every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability for example grappling hook a tornado and a freezer weapon as i mentioned above here are competitive matches after ten games you will get your rank there are ranks like prospect i ii iii elite challenger i ii iii elite rising star allstar superstar champion the game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks like aerials bicycle hits etcetera the verdict rocket league is a unique game with simple rules if you havent bought this game do it you will not regret my final rating is 1010 if you found any mistakes something isnt right or you just dont like this review instead of giving me a thumbs down tell me what is wrong thank you,1,1
252950,Rocket League,very addictive and entertaining game rocket league is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored it is definitely a just 5 more minutes game but amazingly entertaining at the same time the trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished the car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations as you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know the competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play all in all id completely recommend this game to anyone whether youre a casual player or very competitive,1,1
252950,Rocket League,edit i wrote this prior to becoming an employee at psyonix let me start by saying that i have been playing the preview of this game since june 26th i also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas simply said this game is the most fun that may ever exist you find yourself constantly saying just one more game over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down its simple a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams but dont be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay what does this give us though let me tell you satisfyingly tight controls action packed multiplayer awe inspiring aerial goals sniper tactics competitive and casual matchmaking hours of laughing and enjoyment tons of explosions mr torgue aproved an incredibly balanced game all future maps will be free pc to ps4 crossplay over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations and over 10billion of said combinations i can really only say so much about the game itself partly because english was my worst course p but what i really cannot stress enough is that you wont be staying for just the game alone youll be seeing psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community the community of rocket league and sarpbc for that matter is probably the most open friendly and supportive community i have come accross of course this is being said before release and i really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn and general good sportsmanship if you find yourself running into a few bad apples dont worry about it as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players youll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least now i suppose i should say that within the last week ive apparently played nearly 90hrs and thats just playing private matches with the same people constantly some would think that id be bored after that but youd be so so wrong i can play all day get into bed and watch some rocket league videos and then immediately want to play more i may or may not be addictive but dont think youre immune anyways im going to play some more rocket league i hope to see you on the field and remember nice shpt and never let the ball touch the ground rule 1,1,1
252950,Rocket League,just so you know this the first review i spent time on pros many different car choices physics are prefect variety of different stadiums graphics are colourful and vibrant and in 1080p visual settings include anti aliasing msaa ao depth bloom lightslens shadows and blur cross platforming pc and ps4 endless customization decals boost trails tirerimsantennas hats paint finishes over 10 billion possible combinations 100 chance of reward when you finish a match team balance is mostly moderate server connection is fast with low latency only been in one bad server or two crowd react to ball placement cons you havent bought this game yet so scroll back up and buy this masterpiece,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is one of my favorite games why the games system is the best that i can imagine your advantage over other players isnt measured by how many hours you have how many dlcs you got or your level its measured by how much youve learned and perfected you start as a derp car that cant hit a ball 20ft above the ground then you keep playing against people of the same skill until you see someone who can do some coolprofunkyop stuff then you see his goals and you think wow look at that shot i must learn how to do it then in a matter of time you learn how to do it and even do better one step closer to become a rocketeer some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want the controls are great comfortable and very easy to learn if you use a controller you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and viceversa the graphics are nice you can play it with a microwave using low graphics or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps they could be better though the levels normally represent your skill very well if you arent a lot aboveaverage or belowaverage with a rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend the level pro is just wrong you probably arent pro yet if you are there the matchmaker does its job well rather than your level it takes your skill in consideration so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you this isnt bad it is actually very good for you to learn and get better can i say anything more no item in the game gives you advantage over other player all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox not a big deal when you learn the controls the dlcs dont make you better or anything too,1,1

252950,Rocket League,if you dont buy this game i will find you and i will score on you,1,0
252950,Rocket League,ok first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers they worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me so i played this game on beta on ps4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch it didnt disapoint i have it for free on ps4 and bought it on steam to play with friends the game is a ton of fun the gameplay is easy to learn hard to master graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options for free we can face ai opponents with diferente skill levels that can make a huge diference or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours there are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not its great to play with friends hard to quit playing even if youre really tired i seriously recomend using a controller i use my ds4 with bluetooth using inputmapper and it works perfectly for ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller a word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems keep up the good work great game one of the better for sure to release this year,1,1

252950,Rocket League,amazing game this game is so dynamic and energetic not a second is spent bored non stop action with your team always edging to get the game deciding nudge whether it be defense or attack you spend hours upon hours getting addicted and mastering your skills this game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues rocket league will improve once they get proper class ranks gained through playing ranked matches rocket league also features in depth customisation allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle this allows uniqueness and a great ton of laughter graphics of this game is amazing if your computer isnt the best then youll have to turn down the graphics a little but your pc doesnt need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics decent laptops can even play this game decently this game is honestly a 910 rocket league has the graphics the dynamic energetic gameplay the competitive experience in multiplayer and more,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is a footballsoccer inspired sports game made by psyonix in this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal pretty much footballsoccer with cars it might be the best game ive played this year so far there are a few different game modes including online exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship the game modes are fun but not very different from each other i do wish the season mode was more like a franchise mode in something like madden being able to control all the little things of your team and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better but its still worth a play or two the gameplay in this game is perfect once you figure out the flow to your car how to use boosting properly and how to track the ball youll realize just how addicing the game can be against bots or online the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of footballsoccer learning the game comes quick but mastering the techniques could easily take 3050 hours of gameplay you have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with the speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same so there isnt an optimal car to use which is a great thing all the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking im really happy they went this route because you dont feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame you can customize it however you like it besides the season mode being kind of lacking the only other complaint i hadnotice had was the online the first day i had it i couldnt play online at all it just didnt work and apparently until saturday the online was pretty much broken thankfully its been pretty much fixed but i thought it would be an important point to mention it is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem though rocket league is an amazing game with addictive gameplay i dont really get the people that say they dont like sports games a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great and this game is no exception if your looking for a game to play with friends or even by yourself that is very competitive based or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk 20 on give rocket league a shot its one of the best games to come out this year pros strong gameplay easy to learn hard to master plenty of car customization no car building meta you can customize without worry encoranges teamwork reasonable asking price20 cons lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control buy at full price,1,1
252950,Rocket League,when i looked at this game i tought mmmmm little pricey but hey i will try it and its worth it alot fun very addictive i plane to play this alot more pro runs very well alot of fun very addictive pretty good overall car selection online coop cons no current rehab program once your addicted happy with this purchase looking forwards to playing it more good to sit and relax and play or its good to get compeditive and rage quit rating out of 10 810 review date 10072015,1,1
252950,Rocket League,this isnt just a game this a lecture from psyonix a lecture on designing an extremelly fun and addicting game a lecture on building a high quality and very well optimized game a lecture on mantaining a multiplayer game running all around the world and working smoothly across differente platforms and more important though incredibly rare these days a lecture on charging the right price for the right amount of content with the right quality standard,1,1
252950,Rocket League,this game doesnt really need another thumbs up but i feel obligated to write a review since i spent 100 hours playing it by the way thats a lie i only played a couple of matches it doesnt matter if you are a racingfootball fan or not youll love it this game appeals to both casual and competitive players you will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible this is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master i am still horrible at it after 100 hours the good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning so is it a great game hell yes do i recommend it no unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devils child of a game i got it for free with steam hardware at this point i am ready to pay 20 just to get rid of it i am uninstalling it tonight i am just going to play one match real quick ok maybe two addiction level crack cocaine 10 update i now have 300 hours in this game please send help update 2 500 hours whatever keep my soul rocket league,1,1

252950,Rocket League,to give you an idea of how good this game is i currently have 511 games in my steam library and this is the only one ive gone out of my way to review sarpbc the ps3 predecessor to rocket league has been a favorite of my friends and i for years literally years weve put thousands of hours into it its one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because its always fun rocket league im happy to say is sarpbc with improved graphics and gameplay better accessibility for new players plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character its going to comfortably replace sarpbc in my top five games alltime across all genres its also replacing sarpbc as my absolute favorite multiplayer game online or local positive fun deep brilliantly fastpaced gameplay games are long enough to mean something but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating games are almost never over until the final buzzer results can turn on a dime and when they do its always because a player or team has stepped up rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself the learning curve is fairly smooth but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high despite the aforementioned years playing sarpbc i still see players in rocket league pulling off moves that i can only dream of theres massive flexibility in how you play more than any other game i know of offline with bots offline splitscreen online online splitscreen online splitscreen with bots 1 v 1 if you dont feel like playing on a team or 2 v 2 3 v 3 4 v 4 if you do and the game is just as suited to manoamano matches as it is to team play which is again a very very rare quality negative the one slightly disappointing thing ill mention is at launch the lack of variety in maps sarpbc had a bunch of quite inventive distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics rocket leagues maps are aesthetically different but structurally uniform luckily word is that some crazier maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free dlc im still thoroughly enjoying whats already there but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome conclusion if the idea of fastpaced soccer sans rules with cars even vaguely appeals to you get this game immediately its one i fully expect to still be playing and thoroughly enjoying years from now,1,1
252950,Rocket League,better than fifa and pes,1,1
252950,Rocket League,one of the best soccer simulation out there the game is crossplatform with ps4 servers so thats mean there are alot of player to play with actually 28k,1,1
252950,Rocket League,what can i say about rocket leauge i like basketball more than football is way better then nba and fifa and cheaper nba and fifa cost each year 4999 and fifa points cost about 14100 get rocket league for 20 or less and you save alot of money and 5 years warranty more than 5 more popular and competitive then fifa and nba 910,1,1
252950,Rocket League,this game is as addicting as fifa soccer is i do however recommend it with prudence this game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few ive played the game back in alpha and didnt much care for it i like it now more than previously which is an extremely good thing rocket league is a soccer game played with rc cars obviously the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game they can easily scale and drive on walls and even up side down on the roof for a period of time or longer with enough turbo boost or turbo is another feature in game to acquire turbo players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way boosts when timed correctly can produce a power hit on the ball some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed when going this fast and if a player is in your way you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent i am a huge fan of games which feature double jump and rocket league has it the first jump is a bit of a slow jump while the second provides for another boost upwards forwards to the side or in reverse while in the air the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about this trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle it can look pretty cool when done right there are no powerups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game this is only of course if you play competitive noncompetitive games feature powerups none the less the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging the matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local coop is an extremely appreciated feature matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available it will add two ais instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote again its not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with ais sometimes extremely annoying ais that score on themselves this however only applies in noncompetitive mode which for the most part is ok a neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen additionally there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball players can press y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball the player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short you can optimize for performance or quality whoot whoot there are different stages in the game but they are limited or i should say were limited a few more out of this world stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated the customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done from custom paint jobs custom wheels to even custom hats that for some weird reason keep your goal count my only complaint if i can have one is the dlc purchases for new car skins but hey who am i to judge the menus and the ui was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat the music and sounds in game have improved since its start i love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music this is really paying attention to detail the sound tracks in general are pretty catchy that could be part in fact ive also heard them numerous times the game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere its enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions for future rocket league dlcs or games it would be nice to see some minigames the main part of the game is excellent but imagine adding some modifications to it perhaps adding powerups could give an alternative to matchmaking overall good game and i would recommend it to most people there are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it but for the most part it has received positive reception dec 2016 update there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball i think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities they are not available in competitive mode but are still very fun to play youre essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish when you get the hang of flying this games opportunities start flying wide open very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal unlike fifa where you would get discouraged im sure youll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts rating 8110 gameplay a story campaign b visuals user interface b sounds music b replayability a overall a screenshots,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league gt league of legends,1,1
252950,Rocket League,who needs fifa if u can have this game,1,1
252950,Rocket League,amazingly fun great for couch coop runs well looks great is relatevely cheap and has no microtransactions,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i love this game soccerfootball in rc cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball the controls are tight the action intense and its a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose dont get me wrong just like with real soccerfootball its easy to play but difficult to play well but the training gives you the tools you just need to practice highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls how you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right get ready for that with jet cars,1,1
252950,Rocket League,the test of time award,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is a wellmade mix between racing and soccer genre if you are subscribed to any of gaming youtube channels or websites you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it and that hype is not unjustified if this review is too long for you i suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the games content and the final verdict at the end what is happening in the game,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i dont like soccer i dont like cars i love rocket league even with no interest whatsoever in the theme i find rocket league excellent as a game easy to learn hard to master it doesnt start dull it is fun right from the start as a beginner and it only gets better as you improve it involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities i dont mean variety as in different environments or doing different things rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically mechanical skills accuracy timing consistency and mentally spatial awareness intuition for the games physics like momentum or bounces team coordination pretty much like a real sport this makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play rocket league is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports it involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun absolutely recommended to everyone,1,1
252950,Rocket League,a game thats doing its job no microtransactions no crappy story no lags no bad port development i miss these kind of games so simple and so good 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,about the game rocket league is a soccer inspired sports game made by psyonix in this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal pretty much soccer with cars it might be the best game ive played this year so far pro great gameplay very competitive matchmaking easy to pick up and a hard way to master marvelous graphics tons of customization cool dlcs crossplatform save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor con you can unlock a lot of things in such a small time conclusion rocket league is an amazing game i highly recommend it 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league makes you forget that there are no actual rockets in the game 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i suck at soccer but at rocket league well i suck too but hey consistency is the key 100 fun guaranteed,1,1
252950,Rocket League,servers are better than eas although that isnt hard,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i recommend this game for everybody who hates racing and football,1,1
252950,Rocket League,its like football but not a complete waste of time,1,1
252950,Rocket League,its like skyrim but with plane cars and football but without skyrim 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,this is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend got game made party got into a casual 2v2 match 2 am window wide open forgot start match 30 minutes of ragejoyfunscreaming someone starts bashing on my front door figure its downstairs neighbour go silent ignore still bashing still silentignore almost breaks down my door have to open see who it is see cops jail imminent panic open door act nice cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed start tting him i say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops cop says it wasnt the downstairs neighbour who called but the one in the building across the street almost start laughing cop asks wtf was i doing start tting him again he asks why i have the window open say i totally forgot he asks what game are you playing he knows i ask is that a serious question he says dont t me ive been a gamer for 15 years what game i say rocket league he gives me a slight smilenod of approvalunderstanding he knows gives me back my id keep the noise down goodnight 91110 would be arrested again,1,1
252950,Rocket League,what i thought was the worst concept ever really football and cars together come on anyone ended up being one of the most addictive games ive come to cross around pros everyone is on the same page there is no difference in xp cars skins or anything skills are everything very fluid no bugs at least i havent found one multiplatform coop and local coop cons no offline lan that kind of sucks really this would be a reason to not recommend a good game but this game is pretty great so i still give it a recommend oh yeah i want to hear those brats from us and eu talk about how everyone got internet now and we dont need lan anymore and this is a stupid complain please go ahead servers give a connection problem all the time i asked a lot of people and i am getting the same answer from at least 40 of the people maybe is just here in south america and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200 the good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable especially for new not all that skilled players like myself d no the best match making system ever but this is not a con per say just not so great yet i think but really awesome game worth the full price tell your friends and rocket,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is a rare example where the execution of a simple absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesnt need a ton of extra features around it the rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicyclekick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just one more match even without meaningful progression systems rocket league is a great goofy easy to learn and difficult to master actionsports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds,1,1
252950,Rocket League,hey guys first this game is so so so much fun,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket leaguethe game that took the gaming scene by surprise personally i dont enjoy car games racing games or sports games especially not soccer then why does this game interest me so much i have no idea nevertheless i havent been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars youll start out jumpflipping into the ball and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal then youll experiment with boosting after you jumped i hit it you say finally you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground as you cascade to the field you realize that the deathdefying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball into your goal,1,1
252950,Rocket League,first youll blame yourself then youll blame your teammates,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i hate football i have no interest in cars but i actually really enjoy this awesome 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,played during alpha played during beta played an exclusive prerelease failed algorithms and graph theories in college 1110 would fail again,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i couldnt recommend this game any more if i tried buy this game right now you will never regret it this is one of the most entertaining fun and addictive games ive ever played just like its predecessor this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment the physics are superb the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master and it looks beautiful its a game that definitely gets better as you improve which makes it more and more fun as you play it theres something extremely addicitve about playing footballsoccer with cars and with the addition of boost acrobatics and flying it just never stops being fun its one of those games where you always say one more game over and over again theres plenty of different gamemodes to play including season mode drill training online ranked unranked private splitscreen splitscreen online and a bunch more pros the game looks beautiful the physics are spot on so the game relies entirely on your own skill with no automatic passing and shooting youre on your own which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying its so addictivelike really addictivelike oh my god is it 5am already addictive its incredibly well optimised as evident by the generous system requirements you dont need a fantastic pc to play this game on high settings but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with notasgood pcs there is a bunch of customisation features including body types skins hats boost trails tires and whatnot rankbased matchmaking so you actually play people of similar ability rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players theres crossplay with ps4 users its a fantastic party game to play with your friends on splitscreen or online the gameplay is flawless making it really easy for new players to pick up but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skills cons it will ruin other aspects of your life such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness score 1110,1,1
252950,Rocket League,everything is perfect about it i wouldnt change a thing about gameplay its that good amazingly fun game to play but even more fun to me is watching pros like dirkend law tree kronovi gibbs and sorry if i missed anyone that streamed betapreview and actually has shown what are the games possibilities with that being said i think and really hope that this game will become one of next esports big things it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience ill give it 1010 for the game rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot but hopefully that will get changed definitely recommending it,1,1
252950,Rocket League,rocket league is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers you will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that with an amazing multiplayer mode that includes split screen something sorely missing from too many games today that you can take online great controls superb physics and an additive season mode this game is well worth the 20 1010,1,1
252950,Rocket League,cars playing soccerfootball,1,1
252950,Rocket League,you never know how much fun a game can be until you actually try it yeah you hear all the glowing reviews but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself so i bought the game on sale for 1120 usd and was able to quickly find a friend to play with the first thing i did was try the tutorial which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are that was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary next we jumped into an match with easy bots and i scored a goal in the first 4 seconds ok i was not expecting that to feel so satisfying that was the exact point that the hook was set it is not easy to score goals you wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player you circle back and try to attack again and again time goes by and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it the feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face i am not even 2 hours in at this point and i already see the promise this game holds the potential for great fun with friends is there and thats the key i find myself looking forward to my next match i cant wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall,1,1
252950,Rocket League,i decided to give this game a try last night 5 hours later i was telling myself just 1 more game needless to say im hooked its great fun when youre on a roll but when you go up against a team of semipros it can be both frustrating and depressing but i suppose that can go for any competitive game,1,1
252950,Rocket League,you have to play this game srsly you cant judge it by just watching the screenshots or even videos you have to feel it the game is mad fun gaming at its best and its surprisingly deep too its easy to pick up but to really mastering it it will keep you busy for a long time and the devs are the best,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,this is an outstanding game this is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game in a genre that for too long has been deeply troubled with overcasualization poor optimization illthought out concepts microtransactions and general publisher shenangans highs excellent performance i find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows i have not really noticed any dips in performance the game seamlessly transitions between following an entity and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network intuitive game mechanics i was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense and those were reflected in the game as an example i assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work hop on the metro then take a bus when i tracked people they would do this full simulation things just make sense you build a dam the water level raises people go to the store people go to work the water gets dirty from pollution i get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity it gives me context to the experience free focused construction you place roads and zones freely focused around the placement of the roads the zones are indelibly linked to this it was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction it also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game lows the listed city population seems much lower than it should be my city looks like it should be about 100000 people but the listed population is only 30000 not enough snapping options this makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary ocd about this kind of thing its almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly the metro bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done i feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this at least at the start over time i might grow to understand this more also the numbers dont often line up well my metro station might say 100 per week but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro verdict if you like citybuilders buy this game not since simcity 4 rush hour have i enjoyed an experience this much i find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept i strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre and this is not one of those yet i also think it makes the genre more accessible,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,in 2013 after 10 years of waiting the sim city community of modders fans and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of sim city ten years is a long time to wait for a game but people had a lot of faith in maxis when they announced the title long story short it was a massive dissapointment maxis and ea crippled sim city 5 with drm always on apm tiny maps forced origin installation lacking mod support no steam support and a forced multiplayer aspect i decided to not purchase the title so it may have been a decent game but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible everything the mod community did that kept sim city 4 on the shelves in wallmarts across america for an entire decade was ignored maxis and to a lesser extent ea ignored the fans and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game and for that maxis is now out of business they will never make another game and it is no ones fault but theirs now pretend none of that happened its 2013 again and here it is people sim city 5 the game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre but the potential map size is enourmous and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time the game runs so smoothly with so much going on it really shows how lazy maxis was with their approach the glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it there are dynamic shadows zoning is back and it is not dumbed down a single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in sim city and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand the map editor is awesome the community is thriving there are mods to do anything you want and this is the city building game weve all been waiting for i can not possibly reccomend this more,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is the sim city we deserved but never got,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,let me give you a history lesson in 1989 simcity was relased and it was great in 1994 simcity 2000 was released and it was great in 1999 sc3k was released and it was also great are you seeing a theme here in 2003 simcity 4 was released and it was perfection now it gets sad 2007 brought us simcity socities which was a thing and in 2013 brought us sim city and im sure you know what its miraid of problems was now finally 12 years after the last great city building game comes skylines by not trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles collossal order has hit one out of the park runs great on older machines looks great and has great mod support in all honesty while writing the introduction i was trying to think of a negative element that came up still dont have one buy this game,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,so i made my first city getting it from zero to eight thousand when i finally unlocked dams at this point i was doing terrible with electricity because i really didnt want to make many coal plants so the second i saw dams unlocked i saved to make one i found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever and placed the dam as i clicked i knew i made a terrible mistake i made the dam directly beside the densest part of my residential district water poured over the side of the dam and into the city drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings when the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city halfway in residential halfway in commercial in an attempt to fix this i started pumping the water out which actually seems to have worked but i put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps and while i was only pumping plain water out of my city the game counted it as waste water i was feeding my citizens fresh water poop so while water was killing the center of my city poop water was killing the rest the surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection so i got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers overflowing garbage and overflowing sickness all in all an absolutely hilarious experiance great game,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,modding from day one every citizen simulated agent system works on launch no external drm you know except for steam no always online no forced multiplayer aspect not published by ea published by paradox better than simcity half the price then simcity when you compare them at launch price actually fun see ea this is how you make a city builder rip maxis emeryville but dont worry the genre is in safe hands colossal orders hands,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,pros game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder built in modding tools beautiful graphics its challanging learning curve no lag and i have a computer that doesnt meet the requirements lots of replayability cons takes over your life specs that are below the minimum requirements 28ghz 30 is the minimum amd radeon hd 8400 video card nvidia geforce gtx 260 512 mb or ati radeon hd 5670 512 mb is the minimum everything else is above the minimum required,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,saw this game on the front page never knew about it as of writing this review ive only played for six hours and ive already restarted four times because the streets werent straight enough and i went into debt rebuilding them pros no ea no ea origin did i mention no ea involved also no ea new land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand not just confining them to a small square of limited development road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city upgrading also made easy as well simcity 2013s upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere completely negating the point being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building still has wellworking fluid and sewage dynamics taking what simcity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space cough cough simcity 2013 even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam a feat previously impossible in simcity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in simcity 4 the only thing i dont like about this game so far developers the twitterlike announcements and the constant usage of hashtags i get the point but i feel like my city is composed of preteens so far and still hours later 1010 edit 5232015 ive found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at rcitiesskylines and actually listen to their users developers also cranked out free and welldone dlc like its supposed to be game still kicks,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,things i can do in cities skylines that i couldnt do in simcity 5 play without an internet connection name my city something rude like pantyflash edit terrain in a nice map editor play without logging into origin actually have simulated people whose actions make sense every person has their own name and a constant house where they live manage traffic properly have fun i have been a big simcity fan for many years ive collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most simcity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy when simcity societies came out i received it for free with another game i had purchased i must admit it was one of the weakest simcity games i had played but i still put some time into it because i appreciated that the maxis team had tried something different then simcity 5 happened i was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released heck i had been waiting for about 10 years and when i spent what is roughly 45 dollars i thought it was worth it because this is simcity i played the game for about a week and then went played simcity 2000 instead yes thats right i would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013 and when simcity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release i was done done with simcity a game that i have played and loved my entire life the first pc game i owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with microsoft so long live cities skylines long live collosal order 910 ps found a link earlier this week about maxis and ea apparently ea is closing maxis down give it a read httpwwwrockpapershotguncom20150304itsasimeaclosessimssimcitydevelopermaxis what do you guys think about this feel free to comment also please keep in mind that the comments made on simcity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,tldr buy this game if you enjoy the genre and felt like sc5 was a piece of crap pros day one mod support amazing no ea no always online t no origin big city limits suck it sc5 graphics very detailed city simulation down to individual citizens water simulation finnish game studio friend works in the company no ea cons public transportation lines are difficult to edit afterwards when you got many of them and some overlapping would be very helpful to be able to isolate them for easier editing tree placing should be a brush theres a nice mod that fixes this no autosaving theres a mod that fixes this no disasters no time of day different weather effects and seasons,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,finally the city builder everyone was expecting and still wanted devs who listen and care map sizes clean graphics chirpy insane modding community no seriously the workshop for this game is bat crazy i just flew a plane through my city these mods are ridiculous no daynight cycle or online mutiplayer edit after dark daynight cycle added for free who cares though the rest of the game is more than enough and then some id also like to mention rip maxis there should be an ingame memorial park in their honor for cims to pay homage to and an ea park in which homeless vagrants can do what homeless vagrants do this is how you give a gaming community what it wants and how youre paid in return by asking what it wants and listening to what it asks for not telling it what it needs instead take notes ea 1010,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,without a doubt one of the best city builders of all time the price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the steam workshop im so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game the developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players thanks co,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,my first city went bankrupt the second was washed away by flood dont ask third drowned in sewage my fourth and current city as of this writing is doing fine but city layout is horrible traffic jams everywhere this game refuses to hold my hand as it should played for 12 hours straight reluctant to leave my computer to shower eat and go to the bathroom basic needs are for losers,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,this is definitely the simcity successor cities skylines is what simcity 2013 should be although the graphic is nice and the city scaling up through playing the performance is still good and not laggy at all cities skylines features lots of system such and pollution traffic water power etc and large maps you may expand your city by buying the lands and lots of building options creating tons of fun while running a city rich game contents tons of city systems including transport pollution water power entertainment public service etc 6 types of zoning such as residential commercial industrial office etc district planning tool allow you to apply policies base on districts or citywide 5 different industry types generic forest farming oil ore buildings will level up with time lots of traffic options numerous types of road public transport cargo ships trains airplane etc 6 road level to build you may create high complex road design even helixshaped road and more environmental effect pollution flow with river the dam will affect the water level polluted water will make citizens sick etc superb finance and tax system no laggy even with a huge city you can still smoothly run your city cinema camera mode hide all ui and allow you to take splendid screenshots offline gameplay no need to connect to online server to build your cities highly mod support through steam workshop infinite gameplay possibility and extended experience no autosave but theres a mod to do this edit 20150902 we have this option built ingame now no daynight cycle but theres a mod to do this edit 20150902 theres a dlc to patch this on 24th sep 2015 no firstperson camera but theres a mod to do this no random map but there are tons of awesome maps in steam workshop if you were a fan of simcity you must try cities skylines this is the city simulation game youre dreaming of highly recommended cities skylines 2013 simcity lag cities skylines 6 5 6 lag steam 20150902 20150902 24dlc steam cities skylines,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,this really is the greatest city simulator there is and will be for quite a long time im having trouble finding anything wrong with this game ive played most simcitys anno 2070 cities xl and almost fell for the cities xxl nonsense then i found this game and my life is complete some of the things worth noting the ui is simple but intuitive it doesnt have that featureless feeling some of the plainer uis have the game itself runs incredibly well however you do need a good processor and a few gb of ram to play it idealy gameplay is silky smooth and addicting no glitches or anything theres even a little inengine physics to things like cars rivers and trees road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100 accurate unlike 2013s simcity full workshop and ingame modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from copper creek on the workshop is my favorite this list just goes on and on the only thing i can really notice being undesirable to a small extent its not really a big deal are things like garbage and deathcare they tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them when your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing id recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lowerraise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly just a fair little heads up to newcomers your citizens in this game are born age and die eventually dont worry though theyll be replaced by their children for the largest part but there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and its a little scary this is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old if you know what i mean be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen i am not completely certtain if its just that playrhrough of mine of if its actually a phenomenon within the game p to sum it up and make it nice and short for you this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly coming from someone whos a dear citybuilder fan steps on all the other titles and i mean all of them youll love it find my review helpful have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give no problem let me know,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is a city buildersimulation game and its fantastic cities skylines absolutely destroys ea and maxis 2013 effort sim city in every conceivable way where maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented colossal games and paradox interactive have treated maxis effort as a treatise on what not to do this is without a doubt the game sim city 2013 should have been first up the graphics skylines is very well optimized with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems the game looks great with lots of detail buildings grow and level up as you watch changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses you can easily identify different areas and specialties as well as transport power and sewerage systems by colour using the mostly intuitive ui clicking on people houses and buildings will give you more details and identifying problems or successes is made very easy the gameplay is where skylines shines however youll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water power efficient transportation entertainment and medicine to name just a few youll have to control pollution both physical and noise crime and disease there are a variety of ways to do this how you go about it is up to you youll start by placing roads then zone areas off the roads into a category residential industrial retail and office then set up a functioning power grid and clean waterwaste water sewerage system after that its all about placing public services to attract more people and expanding your city across the map and what a map you initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map that said it is trivial to mod out the limitation and if your computer can handle it you absolutely can build on the entire map as a bonus if you dont like any of the premade maps the game ships with you can easily use the ingame map editor to create or recreate your own map to play on there is even an asset editor too so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences the game systems make sense and work how youd expect them to this is a simulation game after all after youve finished zoning your city you can then create districts which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas make the cbd have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic industries will make you money but require careful planning take advantage of natural oil reserves mine ore farm cut down your forests or simply go for generic where youll be making random stuff the finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb the game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing skylines to that end youre given plenty of options such as numerous road types public transport cargo ships trains and aeroplanes surprisingly the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map and pollution will be carried downstream with currents the icing on the cake for cities skylines is the fact that skylines is 100 mod friendly with integrated steam workshop support people have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop as well as gameplay tweaks and its pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop now youve heard me gush over how great this game is what are the cons the game doesnt autosave this is a real pain if you mess up but there is a mod for that there is no daynight cycle which would have been nice but there is a mod for that the camera doesnt let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close but there is a mod for that there is another one that enables a first person view from and person you click on in the street not a lot of maps to choose to play on but the workshop has hundreds available downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click there is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in first person online using the in game people as avatars why who knows but its possible in conclusion if you like city builders or simulation games you cannot go wrong with cities skylines it is everything you could want out of this genre sim city eat your heart out,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,for 2 weeks i debated purchasing cities skylines im sure i annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them eventually i said screw it and made the purchase i have not regretted it since in a nut shell cities skylines is your basic city simulator you start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side of which is the key to growing your sprawling city sounds very simple yes well not quite cities skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together youre required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise dissiptating clogged roadways providing entertainment and so much more essentially this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,lets start with this it is an amazing city building game its the best in generations but like any other game it has its downfalls too map size 1010 the city size is huge at first you start out in a 2kmx2km area but you can expand to a total of 9 of them for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles for a 50x50 km area 2500 km or 1553 mi area the size of this doesnt make your computer lag either unless you dont meet the minimum requirements for the game ai 710 they all have diverse personalities and you can explore the lives of each of them the only problem is the traffic its terrible if there all 6 lanes available they will all go in one lane genius interface 910 the interface is great it is just a little cluttered how it runs 1010 it runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have huge cities for an example watch this video youtube video 3 awesome cities in cities skylinesnbsp,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,i like this pros no ea good performance no always online t mod support launch price is like 5060 of normal full game price on launch game takes up little harddrive space about 24 gbs large build space composed of 2x2km squares that can be unlocked i have 8 at the moment not sure of limit mods to increase it further at cost of performance a few unique mechanics like districts as well as good mechanics youd expect cons easy lack of endgame content looks like a sim city clone yet the clone is gt2 times better tldr good get,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,my people complained because taxes were too high so i placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces within minutes 97 of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people i couldnt let that happen so i bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like while more and more people got sick the population continued to decrease by the thousands it took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead every citizen except for one while everyone else was in bed waiting to die there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country he pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses that man operating the garbage truck is a true hero even through the apocalypse he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived shortly after he drowned in his own rip in peace squidney saxton garbage man 20152015 on the bright side my traffic problem went away,1,0

255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is a city builder developed by colossal order the guys who were responsible for making the cities in motion series and published by paradox interactive and i have to say this is hands down the best city builder weve ever had on steam the size of the game is astonishing by default the game features a 36km2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map were given in simcity 2013 and with the help of mods from the steam workshop this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km2 even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps it is frankly not necessary with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool you can build multiple cities on a single map despite its humongous size the developers paid close attention to details in fact detail is the word ill use to describe this game from the entire traffic network down to individual citizens every aspect in cities skylines are properly simulated youll find lorries colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying delivering their cargoes to their designated factories citizen actually living in a permanent home and ambulances rushing to accident scenes then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher i also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience water has currents and flows so youll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end else youll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system you can even drain a lake dry completely or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam playing with water has never been so fun this is a city builder perfected and with the support of steam workshop further enriched by the endless creativity of the community cities skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,q what i think of this game a best city builder game i played ever period q what i dont like about it a traffic does need to be fine tuned and i feel mods are necessary to balance the game but its very tedious q what about user generated content a workshop community has been very impressive adding so many cool things to the game i am at a point where i feel i am missing out on amazing mods and content because there are so many to choose from and i cant invest the time to try them all but how can you really complain from having too much choice so forget i just said that q does it worth the price a price might seem a bit steep to some but for any fan of city builder games youll get your moneys worth in the first week and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time bottom line you will get a lot more then what you pay for so why wait q what i would love to see added to the game a i would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added milestones are great and sandbox opens so many possibilities yet still i would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives it would help me understand some parts of the game better and bring my game to another level q what are my advices when playing the game a the game expects you to be a pro at this youll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way its easy to cheat the game but it will not make it more fun watch tutorials to get some ideas use mods with caution they can improve the game but can also break it help rating user generated content rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work make suggestions colossal order and paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time q what would i like to say to paradox and colossal orders team a you have given me what i was waiting for thank you but you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already are you proud i am sure you are youve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback and all gamers will benefit from your work kudos to everyone q where am i going a sorry i have a city to build goodbye,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,hi guys this is pablo from simnation cities skylines goes back to the core city builder experience of simcity 2000 3000 4 and improves on it simulation is epic each citizen is simulated with own age workplace home household education level and happines they can even own cars and all of this is persistent all of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes traffic and public transportation is properly executed as well heck even water is simulated with the fluid simulation i think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction the economic system is awesome rci is meaningful commerces import goods from the exterior or local industries if available citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy and all of this is executed and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself building a city on cities skylines is this long epic journey where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly dealing with noise pollution dead body collection and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge from laying down the routes of buses or metros to defining districts and setting unique policies to change the way it behaves or help a sector get back on its feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game from user feedback to user interface and lack of content variety chirps buildings billboards you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right if you like city builders this is hands down a safe purchase a game that will most likely be supported for years with an insanely amount of mods and great deal of free patches to come which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,not owned by ea what more is there to say 1010 edit this is truly the best city simulation games no doubt but the most annoying problem is its traffic i guess sometimes they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams and also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once httpimgurcomgallery5xz1cya what happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city so you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once other than that it is a good game and i really enjoyed playing this some of the mods are fun and helpful and they are easy to configure if you are a new cities skyliner i will recommend you these mods httpswwwredditcomrcitiesskylinescomments3c5skubeenseeingquestionsfromnewusersonessential,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,it worked on day one 1010,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,i have lost control of my life but traffic is running smoothly through orion city 1110 would reccomend,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,this is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years a proper full 3d successor to simcity 4 it is incredibly fun insanely addictive and somewhat challenging although it has some minor drawbacks pros it is so addictive i spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after i got it transportation system is very detailed and agentbased simulation works very nicely with it zoning works very nicely with freeform roads the available territory is quite big up to 36 square kilometers in base game 9 tiles up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod 25 tiles and whopping 324 square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler unique and fully working fluid dynamics system districts and policies allow for fine control over your city globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities from building an ecofriendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime modding is quite encouraged the community is very active and the tools are easy to use by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the workshop dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback free patches significantly improve the game introducing great features like tunnels european themed buildings daynight cycle ingame terraforming canals and quays increased object limits and improved mod tools cons its not very challenging past the first 10k the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic but i cant vouch for their quality the amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small but bigger than on release so youll see a lot of repetition although it is remedied by mods and communitycreated assets you have to keep an eye on ram and vram consumption daynight cycle doesnt really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay again theres an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic rush hour all in all cities skylines is an amazing game thats certainly worth a purchase especially with its low price but you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to its roots avoiding the mistakes made by eas most recent sim city release skylines does without an always online connection supports large building areas and user created mods and while avoiding these pitfalls collosal order and paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game you can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down the ui is clear and easy to navigate building roads and designating zones for construction is simple yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the best city possible there are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime water quality power consumption etc economy isnt overtly deep simple sliders for taxes and options for different policies for those wanting to go deeper you can rename every citizen vehicle building create districts individually manage them alter bus routes and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game industry needs to move products emergency services need to get to calls and dead people need to be removed from their homes more so than pretty much anything you need to keep your eye on this this isnt surprsing given the developers history with cities in motion despite being a paradox game with a similiar name this isnt part of the cities xl series graphics look good for the genre dont expect gta v detailed cities and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing the sounds are what youd expect nothing really stands out and its not annoying fairly average while the variety of options in the game is plenty there are still some things im sure some people will miss from other city building games no day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night there could be a bit more variety in buildings and public services libraries museums prisons zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent im sure modders will fill in this gap given some time but i wouldnt mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future ps kill chirpy,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,a car was driving slowly in front of my firetruck heading for a fire at my favourite building the building burnt down so i found the car drivers house and bulldozed it screw you albert wilson from the anchor residence 1110 would bulldoze again,1,0

255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is a city building simulator build a city from the grounds up managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows this review takes into account the after dark dlc will update review as i acquire and play with further dlcs pros the game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous nighttime lighting effects the tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time these concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds which makes sense a 1000citizen town doesnt need a university or a subway line so you dont get city approval to build these until the population mendates it the developers experience with cities in motion shines through the complex but not complicated public transport system down to bus routes cab depots and international airports city budget is simple with scrollbars for taxes and service expense and various citywide or districtspecific policies ranging from smoking ban for a better city health to legalized marijuana for bonus tourism money is inflated just well enough as either somethings wrong with your city and youre losing a lot of money or you fixed whats wrong and youre making a lot of money preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time unlike some other city builder i know or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait statistics and graph tools are impeccable you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu and you get stats capacity street coverage and building needs right in the city view cons you are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land and while the concept makes sense in tycoonstyle games you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map there are some weird oversights in the graphics such as large ships that literally pass through bridges or trees that grew under water leaves and all building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy i regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves i mean im all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid but it should allow you to build straight when you want to ironically buildings and land tiles which you may want to customize actually are locked in a grid along the road even with a dozen alternate routes every single car including emergency vehicules use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams a problem that only gets worst as the city grows verdict play this now the cons may appear lengthy but its only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes cities skylines is the best city builder out there bringing everything that was fun about simcity 4 deluxe edition equaling or surpassing most innovations simcity 5 brought and adding so much of its own if you like city simulators at all this one is a must have i cant wait to experience the snowfall dlcs new weather conditions and city services as well as the upcoming natural disasters dlc thatll give it the only things left simfans can still brag about ps i havent mentioned the mods available through the steam workshop but i just have to point out bryan shannon a former maxis artist who does professionalquality building mods for cities skylines if you have any interest in downloading mods for this game you should browse his collection this was just my opinion if you found this review helpful please consider giving it a thumbs up and feel free to check out more of my purely opinionated reviews,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,hmm after 42 hrs i got onto this game i finnally reviewed this game 110 hrs learning about the game 2025 hrs learning about make profit in game 2530 hrs learning how to manage services stop area 3540 hrs learning how to manage dead people 40 now hrs still dunno how to manage dead people in right way 95 10 city builder simulator why 95 1 important point about city simulator is day night cycle its more live when this game have day night cycle,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,this is the city builder of my dreams,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,i started with city builders way back in 1996 with simcity 2000 beginning the construction of my capital of capitals i was nine i nerded out made it a capital of an empire i created for myself heh for the permanently angled view the constant reticulation of splines and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild sc3k and 3k unlimitedworld edition was the same basic idea with a lot more detail and sc4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger rush hour was a neat touch too because you could actually into the streets not quite like streets of simcity but close enough even societies which gets a bad rap because its not maxis among other reasons worked out great perhaps even better as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely i tended to build authoritarian cities heh heh then came simcity 2013 and it seemed like a good idea to start except for the constant online feature the drm controversies so onand the fact that the city sizes were fixed as opposed to the variouslysized tiles made available in sc4 it basically turned into another typical ea game buy more of this it will enhance the experience i was disappointedcities of tomorrow was an interesting touch but not enough to keep me going then i heard about cities skylines a number of people suggested the similaryetunrelated cities xl and various sequels to me in lieu of sc 13 and when this came out some pointed me here i got it during the last sale about a month ago and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitalsand for the first time in twenty years it felt like a real city with real needs i was used to the basic stuff mainstays of most citybuilders of this type needs power water garbage disposal police so on but in my first playthrough i looked in the healthcare tab and went waitcemeteries you have deathcare in this game which was kinda funny to me as in real life i like to explore historic cemeteriesthe thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities the unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch because theyre functional as well as decorative i have them all except for the fusion plant i need the observatory the weather is also nice i will have to get the snowfall pack to see how well i can build in the snowif its anything like new england winter probably not too well while there is still a size limit barring the use of mods for your city its a lot larger than in sc 13 and also has a lot more flexibility than sc 13or any other type of game like this ive played for that matter and the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city in short loads of fun and its induced me to commit heresy against the church of simcity by building hereany fans of the golden oldies please dont burn me at the stake,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,able to play on launch day 1010,1,0
255710,Cities: Skylines,the important thing to know about this game is that its not related to the cities xl franchise,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,this game is comparable to simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay a whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and drm pros realistic water simulation if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river youre gonna feed your citizens with poop water and dams will alter the flow of the river noise pollution is taken into consideration can be caused by traffic windmills industries etc district zoning allows you to micromanage your city easily policies can be introduced only to the specific districts for example in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city such as education crimes and so on natural resource exploitation for more income detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as simcity before you are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter this allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows makes it easy for new players to learn cons road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted this kinda irritate the ocd side of me the unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on and you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings i will continue to update my review as i put more hours into this game feel free to comment on your opinions,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,could play on launch day 1010,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,you can build an actual city 1010 ea sucks,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,colossal order paradox and steam workshop i want to thank you all for a fabulous game ive played simcity since its very first release and it was always up until its last disappointing release my all time favorite computer game now looking back its as if simcity is the game one plays in childhood even though i was very much an adult in 89 lol but as an adult you move up to the real thing which is clearly citiesskylines its a grand city building game to be sure and steam workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm this game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning urban renewal city design environmental impact traffic patterns and how people drive and why and im loving it every new chapter i read inspires me to revisit what ive already built in cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population and the tools i need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game im having so much fun d do i recommend this game d unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,bought it on release day within 1 hour i uninstalledsimcity 2013 simcity 4 and simcity societies simcity was the game growing up and now skylines has brought that back in tenfold skylines is missing three things that i would love to see disasters no not zombies or monster attacks disastersa weather dynamic system such as rain snow tornadoes hurricanes monsoons mudslides earthquakes tsunamis floods and volcanic eruptions also economic and human disasters would be awesomeie wwiii breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military base elections and council have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land major company hqs sporting eventsteams and world events let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hqs in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot let us bid for the olympics then have to build the buildings should we win the bid or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team world events such as a worlds fair or papal visit or other major world events thats my three wishes maybe a developer will see at least one,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,how do these pissants keep tweeting about my failures as a mayor after i shut down their electric supply those iphones have to run out of power eventually and if that fails i have a bulldozer to destroy their houses which lets be honest here theyre really my houses i built this town and if those worms dont like it then they can just pack their bags and leave tolaintopia i bet this is what being a third world dictator is like,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,sorry to inform you but were going to have to demolish your homes but why how many days do we have left and whats going to happen to us the destruction of your property will begin immediately find somewhere else to live why are you doing this our mayor decided to build roads that were too small and plans to replace them with 6 lane one way megahighways in the middle of the residential sector 1010 would go into financial crisis by forcibly relocating whole populations for the sake of road symmetry again,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,ill compare his to the latest sim city game cities skylines can feed citizens poop water can stalk citizens can bulldoze citizens homes you can drown entire cities you can create statues you can create shaped maps did i mention you can feed citizens poop water 33 sim city 2013 none of the above requires it that shall not be named starts with an o ea the s that kill puppys for fun cities the size of a baby koala 60 plus a 40 dlc do the math cities skylines is godlike compared to sim city buy cities skylines btw collosal orders is like what 12 people maxis was what 100 or so people and 12 people made a better game i hate my life,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is a brand new citybuilding game in the vein of simcity but built with modern sensibilities what is great about this game the citybuilding simulation is deep complex and incredibly satisfying to master the agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage a variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city the game looks and runs beautifully available areas for expansion are massive and truly huge with easy to acquire mods modding and steam workshop support is pervasive in the game and the modding community is prolific what is good about this game good use of steam features cloud saves trading cards achievements etc what is bad about this game some of the mechanics of the simulation eg freight train depots rci are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problems conclusion cities skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games this is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre and everyone should at least try it once 100 100,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,with after dark released i can finally make a legit review for cities skylines cities is the most polished realistic best city building game i have ever played coming from early simcity games and then to cities xl i can say that csl is a very very recommended game that i will always recommend to any person interested in these games i love city builders and csl was amazing from the start many features include budget management detailed transportation info and many options on roads and how you want to build your city you can expand your city limits and make your city thrive with very little bugs and massive modding support this game is the best of the best cities after dark has made it so much better with activity in your city slowing down which in turn makes your economy slow down at night adding a new challenge to the game as night progresses some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue taxi services train lines bus lines and subways are options for public transportation water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality i love cities skylines,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,when starting off cities skylines i thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it the game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre youtube video cities skyline review with kenutynbsp,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,do you like creation or city building if yes to either give this game a long look the two primary ways soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the disasters dlc youll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money or more vanilla which wont use mods what i love scale the maps are massive even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81 you have a massive space to develop decorate and grow as a point of reference sim city 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in cities skylines as a bonus there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city living cities the people and the traffic all have a life a destination theyre not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence you will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor civil engineer and accountant of your city cities traffic wars some love it some hate it i love traffic wars i love the problem solving the beautification designing of interchanges its a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully nothing wrong with that yes there is quirky behavior but it doesnt detract massively from the experience i have a couple tips leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving that goes a long way there are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as how to traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game workshop mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city mods provide powerful options to take control and build with massive freedom download responsibly and there will be minimal issues you arent limited to zoning and plopping you can create beautiful planned cities the only limitation is your imagination not so great dlc a bit pricey for what you get excluding after dark that dlc is excluded and i would definitely take no issue paying full price on very feature rich unfortunately the same level of praise is not really warranted for snowfall trams and snow maps are nice but i would not buy it full price vanilla gameplay as a first time experience to get achievements its fine in its own right but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods you can use building assets props etc in vanilla the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods difficulty this is a double edged sword lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building and city painting this is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla this will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in simcity fortunately for the challenge inclined you can make it much harder on yourself with mods and scenarios are coming out soon which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the disasters dlc it will be free tldr love building traffic wars the almost endless beautification options and i can be a major creep as i roleplay god with my topdown world view as i stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night he actually does live in that house glorious would i recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders absolutely,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,ive been completely consumed by cities skylines its everything that simcity should have been there are massive maps a simulation that appears to work very well a great interface lovely visuals an editor and the ability to really mod the game properly 910,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,whats good huge playable area versus simcity 2013 workshop endless modability even without buying the dlc you still get some stuff every dlc release whats not so good resource hog you need a nasa computer to run this on all high no disasters or random events traffic is at rush hour all day everyday without mods the last dlc snowfall includes some good stuff but the main crux is merely vanity and only useable in new games again without mods if you loved simcity 4 and are yearning for a modern remake thats not simcity 2013 this is a good attempt to revive the series beware that youll need a few of the modsworkshop to really make the game shine free badges,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,i had an ice factory catch on fire 6910 no but seriously i have played a lot of city sims in my day simcity tropico citiesxl etc and i can say this is the best i have played while the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first the game does a poor job introducing you and there doesnt seem to be any real tutorial once you start learning how to create your districts city blocks highway systems services mass transit etc the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope the maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city its a far cry from the tiny districts from the latest simcity the mechanics such as placing buildings and infrastructure are intuitive and easy to use for the most part the transit lines could use a bit of work and rarely did i have to wonder why cant i place this here or why isnt this working the amount of ingame content for your city is also quite robust and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more this is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own 910,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,dear maxis if you had done sim city 5 like that youd still exist today dear focus home interactive this is actually how you do a city simulator then again you basically bought cities xlxxl from monte cristo before they tanked and rerelease it every year by adding an x to the title so its not like you ever tried anyway,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,the s very detailed buildings roads cars down to the physics in the water huge areas of land multiple landscapes to pick from ton of premade worlds to get started in trains boats airplanes subway hearses trash trucks fire engine police car ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles every person is doing something in the city with cool activities like a ton of different style parks and hey actually animate them doing it create a bus route and dont enough stops hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery steam workshop easy ui progressing with milestones feels rewarding wind turbines turn against wind i thought this was really cool now there is a ton more s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight so heres the s pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad not really many events other than random fires which dont spread yes there is a mod for this still should be done natively road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets no auto save feature yes there is a mod for this still should be done natively no cycle of day and night yes there is a mod for this still should be done natively sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace thats not desirable usually people like to speed it up but if you have a decent city the demand for structures will never stop or slow down can pause but a slow down option wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that way things i would like in the game riots maybe a military base with units or swat team that could stop riots more events spreading fire natively i am not sure if it exists outside of a mod but snow more things for people to do other than parks and plazas baseball park football stadium etc i know the workshop will have tons of this stuff but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool seasons that change on time of year night mode with lighted sky scrapers and other models i highly recommend this game although its more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations at the time being at least 30 dollars is a great steal if you are affraid of dlc the workshop should ease that a but with over 20000 items and growing,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is said to be a modern take on the classic city simulation and after playing around for many hours it is on that path and its the best we have of a new modern city building simulator and its the best we will probably have for a while this is to an extent the city building game weve been waiting for at least the best one were going to get thats is satisfying not buggy not overly restricting but one thats made with care thats free from tiny shackles with freedom and space to have creativity built in it and one thats design nicely combined with support for community support youtube video cities skylines gameplay previewnbsp,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,i bought this game 2 days before it went on sale for 75 other then an overwhelming sense of poor timing i like this game,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,gthave entire city running on solar power gtbuys after dark gtentire city blacks out 1010,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,to me this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game its a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to its roots clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of maxis and ea with simcity everywhere it failed to deliver this game has got it with a focus on things like steam workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasnt been made to become a dlc machine youtube video cities skylines first look gameplaynbsp,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,full disclosure review copy provided by developerpublisher i come from a long proud line of urban planners my father is an urban planner as was his father and his father before him his fathers fathers father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation but the fast carsmoneywomengoats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me much to my familys chagrin i pursued writing and they were and continue to be devastated before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play cities skylines this is in your blood son he smiled weary from a hard day of urban planning please for me for the family so i started to build my first city across from a scenic river and i dont know i dont know how to explain it it just clicked i stretched roads in a grid and began zoning visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights further still they would find themselves in our residential district with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore but to build a city you have to do more than just plan you have to create i built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out satisfied i unpaused the game and watched slowly skeletal structures emerged from the earth supports were raised and lowered and buildings became occupied little storefronts popped up factories rose up and dream homes were built cars flooded my little two lane streets full of wideeyed country bumpkins presumably and things were good for a time i sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro traffic ebb and flow and more buildings appear from empty lots perhaps my father had a point oh an achievement unlocked bad mayor have 15 happiness i guess i wasnt paying close enough attention wait what do you mean sewage is bubbling up and so my city 420blazeit360noscope drowned in a sea of human waste langston hughes a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat for the record it was also crusty cities skylines is the sleekest smartest and most potentialicious city builder available currently and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated dedicated modding support youll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp to get your city off the ground youll do what i mentioned previously sans massive sewage backup youll zone districts set up the water and electricity and watch your little hamlet bustle as your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities youll have to build accessible clinics police stations schools and fire stations youll have to keep pollution sound ground and water in check districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region or banning smoking in a residential area prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand buildings are abandoned taxes are too high etc in addition chirper the games twitter feed thingy will tweet pertinent if sometimes repetitive and annoying information with every addition and upgrade youll have to expand further and further balancing the budget happiness and health of your city along the way eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles upgrading rebuilding rezoning public transit shipping the scope of it is a little overwhelming old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis in no time for the uninitiated id recommend watching the frequent twitch streams and youtube lps mastering cs requires a great deal of foresight sure you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread build the more expensive green energy alternatives and youll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire and fire crime arson sounds much to pedestrian when you have a breather however its one of the most relaxing satisfying games ive ever played watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing people walk their dogs firetrucks blare by garbage trucks make their rounds it feels alive despite some technical glitches trains jumping tracks cars driving into burning buildings little oversights with no bearing that should be patched early into release i dont really have any complaints yes seasons and a night cycle would have been nice more aesthetic flavors for buildings and locations would keep things fresh and more disasters to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with natural human seasonal or just plain silly while the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours there are already mods new assets and maps to spice things up just like a real city a real community this games replayability will be dependent upon community involvement and i predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come theres something really special about cs and i cant quite put my finger on it its like waking up on designated applicable holiday morning to a big present and you unwrap it and its one of those farm playsets or when youre zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum and then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is the city builder ive been waiting for since 2004 it is intuitive has actual working citizen travel flowing water mostly realistic travel and looks beautiful it is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release and no forced online or tiny city sizes even without mods you can built a huge metropolis in this game downsides traffic isnt perfect so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns the devs are working on this though music is forgettable nothing like the excellent simcity series and it is extremely addictive this game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day tdlr best city builder in over a decade buy it today,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is a wonderful city builder it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive pros beautiful camera controls are nice crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name house and job to street light flickering before they change a nice selection of maps to choose from has that nice classic city builder feel to it looks very modern day 1 mod support easy to use level editor building creator thing lots of options for obtaining resourses developers seem to be active and nice sounds are nice rewards you for milestones has actual water physics which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature cons people are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere some people wont be educated even though there is a school next to them some of the random tweets get repetitive dosent have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before because there is no tutorial i have no way or preplanning anything thats about to come my way and i end up not being able to build things i need citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didnt build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb vehicles sometimes dissapear bus metro trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial sometimes the game wont let you build a roadbuild ext because there is something in the way but there isnt overall i rate this game a 910 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,cities skylines is the unofficial simcity sequel we deserve from the very beginning the game feels much closer to simcity 4 than the most recent iteration of simcity the game embraces steam workshop and the amount of custom content already is outstanding i have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and i wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence pros steam workshop integration massive cities enjoyable challenge cities feel alive hours and hours of content great price for launch allows for cities of all shapes and sizes cons traffic needs some balancing lots of repeated buildings custom content helps trash and death can get out of hand due to traffic all in all i recommend cities skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre the game is addictive and provides hours of fun i am 15 hours in and i only have 50000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow the 30 is fair but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,that feeling when you buy a plot of land equal in size to that of sim city 2013and there are dozens more to buy,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,woke up early started playing realised it was way past dinner time havent eaten all day should cook something what sc2013 should have been 1010,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,i used to play and enjoy simcity but i was sometimes disappointed especially with the traffic simulation then a friend recommended me to try cities skylines at first i thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to simcity but after a while it became easy to play and i started enjoying it i am impressed with the traffic simulation it is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads of course simcity has advantages in other ways but i am pleasantly surprised by cities skylines and i can definitely recommend it ps you end up being addicted to the game d,1,1
255710,Cities: Skylines,the new city building game standard future city building games should look at cities skylines as guidance and noless than this this game has its own uniqueness with solid gameplay like sc4 graphic is goodlooking not the best but its more than enough sounds is okay for me not really special tbh gameplay is awesome this is what ive been waiting for since sc4 no mp for me its not a big deal i only want a solid singleplayer city building game,1,1

255710,Cities: Skylines,so good that maxis employees resigned just to play this game,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,to anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negative you need to know one thing darkest dungeon is an emotional game to people just starting out it can seem baffling unfair and deliberately obscure to people who have been playing since early access and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete the steam reviews page is more of an extension of reddit than anything else a place to air grievances legitimate or otherwise over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to what a lot of these reviews miss out is yknow the actual review part on that front i would say the following the core gameplay is rock solid at its heart darkest dungeon has taken a minimalist turnbased fourman combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair figuring out the best role for each of your heroes chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying unlike a lot of games it doesnt feel like there is a a ringfenced area of correct vanilla play that only the very highlevel players can get past instead you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go the central combat system is smart it pushes you to experiment and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own unique creation however if thats all darkest dungeon was it would be a neat tabletbased distraction but ultimately sterile it is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue and also the source of a lot of the frustration youll see directed at it as a typical rpg player you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your characters and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure dd refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine and a massive enemy critical attack an ambush in pitchdark while camping or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seeminglyunassailable position to a very desperate one the potential for a failcascade is what turns off many new players and even drives experienced ones to the occasional ragereview but it is also vital to the fundamental riskreward balance of the game which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part as you progress through a dungeon you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light food sanity and health although they can be restored in some ways while also trying to complete objectives and collect muchneeded loot with limited backpack space usually this is the sort of gameplay i dislike feeling that there is a timelimit that i cant plough through something at my own speed in relative safety is an uncomfortable experience after most games however the actual result is some very effective tension in a normal rpg say diablo the steady drip of everincreasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way but in dd the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a moment rather than just a nice bonus it can initially feel punishing and unfair since most gamers are hardwired to see a hero death which is permanent a catastrophic turnaround or a tactical retreat as a failure likewise the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded like youre just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no god or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong it takes time to realise that you were never meant to have it easy that its always been a gamble and you cant expect a perfect s ranking all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have it takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game rather than a failure even i rage quit every now and then but i always come back because as i said darkest dungeon is an emotional game you invest real time and fake money in your group of heroes the odds are massively stacked in the houses favour none of your guys is going to come out unscarred you are going to face some serious setbacks but you return because actually making it actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment realising youve scraped through again is always a surprise and an amazing one at that,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i feel like i have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are predecember site problems that have been addressed red hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics like the stress for delaying a fight can just turn them off red hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base the problem is that the player base is greatly divided there is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful while i dont want to get into that if you want you can absolutely find information about it now that the game is released you may have seen a certain top review i urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks which includes the time since the game was actually released and notice that he has not played the game since the release which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved he has been attacking the game for months and was as far as i can tell initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision please keep this in mind when considering your purchase this game is amazing and ive been playing since early summer it has come incredibly far and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements or flat out lying darkest dungeon has xcom levels of difficulty it has xcom level wtf moments occasionally you will miss 99 chance to hit attacks and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings but just like xcom through base building and experience you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with this game is challenging but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe most of them say things like the devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy or the game is antifun now but in reality i havent met any players new to the game that have problems with it this leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game players found certain strategies that were drastically overpowered which is why in the discussion boards there are players that rant about the game being too easy and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies which in any other game would be considered a balance patch but apparently in this game people think it is intended to be funkilling one of these strategies early on was to get 4 of the same class and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything this is no longer possible this seems like a reasonable balance patch to me im really disappointed that i have to write this review in this fashion there is no reason i should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews this is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy andor lovecraft i have 300 hours for a reason you might not get that much time out of it but for context out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons i didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours i really hope you give this game a chance edit due to some feedback i would like to make something clear this game is not xcom it does not have xcoms production value or quality and it is not worth 60 dollars it is certainly worth its current price tag and buying it on sale is a no brainer release edit now that the game is out i can say that the devs really came through they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release i recommend this game 100 and it will only get better from here as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,heres why people are giving negative reviews because they want everyone to be alive in their roster because they spent so much gold removing negative quirks and whatnot you will die in this game whether you like it or not confident that your party is able to take on a particular dungeon because they are now higher level nope not happening random collector spawns and kicks your partys this is not about rng its about complacency if you go into this game thinking that you want all your characters to be perfect and nice rainbows and glitters everywhere then this is not the game for you if your party makes it through alive at the end you should thank your ancestors if you are a perfectionist this will be a very hard game for you your characters are essentially cannon fodder disposable like daily contact lenses occasionally you buy monthly ones but you dont use them forever they all have a shelf life at some point they will become redundant or die nothing lasts forever,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,after a successful battle the haunting voice of the narrator of darkest dungeon speaks to me stating that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer before i might have shrugged this off assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone but ive played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line its a warning darkest dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game ive ever seen before the gothicinspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices ive ever heard in a game beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting the premise of the game is simple you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land in order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons four at a time to complete various tasks achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on this includes your heroes their mental and physical wellbeing their equipment and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive there are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemys line you must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon andor boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered perhaps the most important aspect of darkest dungeon is the affliction system which dictates the psychological state of your heroes every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level if their stress level gets too high they will respond physically to their emotional state in rare cases this might actually give them a bonus but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive the stress system is not something to be ignored and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes before even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon it is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage by paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold it is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon this might be an annoyance to some but i think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money with the game saving automatically as you go along theres no ability to fall back on savescumming to avoid disastrous situations a mistake in planning can prove to be fatal causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with in order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that i believe only comes with games that actually challenge you i truly love this game and cant recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,tldr community outrage simulator masquerading as brutal dungeon crawl 1010 would read a thousand angry formerlypositive reviews about corrupt devs instead of playing a great game again i picked up dd over the summer drawn in by a sociological interest in certain members of the communitys outrageously toxic backlash to the implementation of corpses and some other changes obviously i was familiar with and intruiged by dd for its excellent art style already but generally i am the type to wait for something to be complete before i give it a shot however the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe youd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them so thank you dear angry entitled imo wrongheaded but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion which you most certainly do oh yes you do players for without your concentrated delerious ire i may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last and now this year for me everything about this game is a win the art animation music sound design narration and general presentation are all topnotch the prose itself is a particular highlight as is the tongueincheek brutality and general tone to me they really nail it its hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be dd is a procedurallygenerated turnbased dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty with reference to dark souls and light rpg elements and squadmanagement with reference to modern xcom i concede that this can be considered grindy dungeon crawlers are generally grindy even great ones like dungeon of the endless or legend of grimrock the distillation of the various aspects of the form the massive selection of character classes buffs debuffs monsters the writing the aesthetic these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts however if you dont enjoy that core to some degree or other i dont know why youd be considering this anyway personally i never had a problem with corpses because i never played the game without them over 50 hours i managed to beat a number of the bosses level characters up to the top tiers etc ect and only stopped because i felt like i had gotten far enough where i was ready to play the game in a finished state and didnt want to master too much i also died a lot then i died some more and it was fun the whole time as the year went on and waves of negative steam comments continued to roll in i felt like i was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players as they railed against it getting harder and harder for example i found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier i certainly wasnt dying as much maybe i was just somehow very good at it i dont know i still die all the time in xcom i dont think of myself as a master gamer or tactician the other critique i saw a lot which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it is that the devs somehow didnt care about the criticisms that they dont listen or that they were corrupt or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the early access community that this game was somehow some kind of scam thats just ridiculous there were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year which added all kinds of content in various ways they were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked they were communicative and they were clearly listening and being involved and also making the game for goodness sake cmon getting back briefly to the great corpse outrage 2k15 for example corpses were made a voluntary optout in the options menu pretty much from backlash ground zero not that a developer has any reason to do something like that but to then deny that it happened or to say that they dont listen that theyre somehow scamming you that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical petulent garbage argument i cant understand what this aspect of the community actually wants for the life of me if the game isnt for you you certainly dont have to play it but a certain amount of the negativity which borders on outright hostility strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasnt cooked to his liking still you have to admire if not boggle at their conviction and their sheer verbosity of it all for me this game actually sold me on the idea that early access could be an enjoyable worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and i couldnt be happier with my decision to do so and i look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that theres a worthy enjoyable wonderfullycrafted experience at the center of everyones opining,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,with all the negative reviews lamenting the changes made since the game was originally put on early access i feel like i need to throw some positivity into the mix because this game is amazing ive been playing on and off since it was first put on steam and am aware of the various changes which have been made throught each iteration of the game to summarize darkest dungeon used to be significantly easier before the devs bumped up the difficulty i only had a handful of characters die and i knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death the changes the devs made are not unfair new mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original visionyour characters are not heroes no matter how powerful they become being hurt is always something you want to avoid overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle back before the changes dungeon runs required significantly less forethought and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a final fantasy now each fight is a struggle for your life and while this certainly makes the game more challenging that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning no doubt ill get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other but oh well tldr the game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits its a very challenging game and rng can kick your butt but you can always avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission you are in control greed and overconfidence will be your downfall as for an actual review ill be brief the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward success is shortlived and defeat is painful but the journey is fantastic classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique bosses will push you to your limits there is some aspect of grind and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming but i enjoyed myself the whole time if youre on the fence with the one the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy its not for everyone and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if youre not into that sort of thing still i recommend this game to everyone i know and it gets a big thumbs up here,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,people complain about the rng but they dont understand that the game isnt supposed to be fair this game is about making the most out of bad decisionscircumstances which is exactly what makes this game great,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,nominated for an award i thougt it was cool before it got an note this is quite a long review and if youre thinking about buying the game its well worth your reading darkest review,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,my hours in this game should accurately reflect my love for it however it is not for everyone if you are looking at the title then ill make a few assumptions you like dungeon crawlers leveling up classes loots which you will certainly find here a few reasons ive spent nearly 300 hours on this game and not others should be what draws you in or dissuades you from purchasing difficulty listed 1st for a reason that some gamers dont enjoy a game that constantly and regularly challenges you and would appreciate a more liesure gaming experience understandable but that is not this title my experience in tough games and many hours in this one and i still have points sometimes often that i need to retreat style heavyinky style gives it a dark world that perfectly fits the narrative and story it should be said the story is not something that explains itself very clearly that being said the finer details in journals that you will find as well as the only voice in the game are done flawlessly i could listen to this guy read a phone book and be enthralled replayability some may find the scope of the game rather small and they wouldnt be necessarly wrong it isnt the completion of the game that wasis my goal i actually was reluctant to finish it because i was worried i would lose interest they do offer a ng new game plus mode after completion which adds a couple challenging hurdles for revisiting the estate but the completion isnt the goal doing things better differently and getting wiser was the carrot to lure me in to the long haul,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,laughing at the people calling the game too hard like friend its the point you know what this game was designed to do crush you break you but the real joy comes from spitting in the games eye telling it no you getting back up every time youre knocked to the ground yeah the rng can easily ruin your day your party your hero that you built up but you know what sometimes life deals you a bad hand what matters is how you handle it how you adapt to the way life ed you this is not a game thats supposed to make you feel good or like youre good at video games or that everything will be alright as long as you believe in the power of friendship its a game that makes you feel like you can take whatever life throws at you no matter how much it sucks in the moment because you know how to cope with unfair t bring it life,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler game developed by red hook studios the game was initially released in early access in january 2015 before leaving early access in january 2016 gameplay in darkest dungeon leaves you in control of a roster of heroes you control almost every aspect of your heros journey throughout the game initially you start out with two heroes from the tutorial and you can expand your roster by visiting the stage coach in the main game hub here you can select from at least two heroes and have them join your group the central hub of the game also includes various other useful locations too such as an armour smith weapon smith a tavern hospital and many more each of these locations becomes key to the progression in darkest dungeon the dungeon crawling side of the game is done from a side scrolling perspective as you explore randomly generated dungeons in search for loot and treasure the combat in this game is turn based and very tactical each of your party of 5 heroes will have their own preferred location in your group and will only be able to use certain attacks based on their location too each of your characters has 4 active abilities they can use in a dungeon you can swap and change them as you please in the main hub provided you have learned the skill beforehand your party will also contract diseases afflictions blights and wounds throughout their journey and most will probably even die or become useless you can cure these by visiting the hospital in the hub but some may render your character pointless to have around like the game says at the very start you really have to make the best out of a bad situation most of the time graphically it isnt very intense however the art style which is presented is just wonderful the art style is really important to this game as it shows the essence and feel of the game perfectly the hand drawn look to the game is one of my favourite styles in gaming at the moment and darkest dungeon wets my appetite beautifully there what is really important here though would be the games user interface as there is a lot of information needed to be able to progress successfully through the game you are obviously going to need a clean and clear interface to show that information the games tutorial at the start of the game explains a lot of it quite nicely however a lot of the information is left for you to find out for yourself all of your characters information stats and equipment are all a click away as well as your map and inventory screen i was really happy with the interface a few changes i would of made is to add a lot of information to show right on the screen straight away rather than having to hover over the item or bar it just felt like an unneeded hoop to jump through to get the information i wanted the ordering of the turns can be quite difficult to keep track of as well i still have no idea how it is worked out but i would of liked to have seen maybe a time line of the battle somewhere on the screen to make it a little easier for you to plan your attacks maybe this was considered already but was specifically not added so the game is all that much harder that to me is the only logical reason for not having something like that included the audio in darkest dungeon is also spot on as well first of all the narrator is just plain awesome his rusty voice sent shivers down my spine at times it is very much on par with other great narrations like bastion and transistor sound effects are all really nicely designed too the attack noises and monster sound effects are very nice and add an extra level of immersion to your game play this may be the hardest video game i have ever played the game is so unforgiving and you will get screwed over and you will probably die from your own stupid mistakes over and over again but that is the whole point of this game the aim to finish the game is very hard to hit and when you do hit it you will be able to give yourself a very well earned pat on the back because you will have just completed a monster difficulty game i have never actually completed lost all of my party members there seems to be an endless supply of them in the games hub so you will never lose the game so to speak you can just keep retrying all be it with lower level characters this is one of those games where i had to spend a sufficient amount of time outside of the game in the wiki and on forums just to give me that little extra edge over the unforgiving game play i am not ashamed to admit and you shouldnt be too if you have to check little bits of information out due to playing the game a lot offline this week due to pc problems a lot of my time has not been tracked but i have put in roughly 30 hours of gameplay i have still not finished the game i have managed to hit max level with about 6 of my characters but i have been spending quite a while farming and grinding money for me to upgrade them more before taking on the final stages of the game due to the games randomness the replay ability is extremely high even when you manage to finish it the once this is a game you can easily get at least 100 hours out of without growing bored of it technically i had no issues what so ever it is definitely a game you have to use a keyboard and mouse on just because of the amount of information you require access to there arent any graphical options available sadly but it should run on just about anything as it isnt graphically intensive although it isnt exactly a technical talking point but a nice added feature here was that you can actually turn off some of the game mechanics right out of an options menu yes this may make the gam experience differ and may even decrease the difficulty but i personally dont see this as a real issue in a single player game my conclusion on darkest dungeon is that it is one of the best games to come out via the early access system even when it was first released it was a better game than most but now it has been fully released this year it is an absolute must play title all other devs looking to release a game into early access really need to pay attention to these guys as it was done so perfectly and hassle free i can easily say that it is my up most favourite roguelike game ever the games regular price on steam for 18 99 is a good price point there is tons of content and extremely high production values put into this game do not hesitate for a second more and pick this game up toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6 this is a must play if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up if you would also like to follow my

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,ive had darkest dungeon for a while now and im pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it dd has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with rng especially as you frist start out many people say that there is no fail state but you feel like a failure when you lose about 1020 hours of progress per character you lose there have been ways to be careful risky and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible rng however the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die but also introduce new facets that screw you over more the reason i dont recommend this game is because i feel like the developers are heavyhanded with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that arent working properly several trinkets simply dont work several skills dont work as intended looking at you man at arms with guard thanks for getting my arbalest one shot several of the buffs and debuffs dont work as intended and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken since the patch ive had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies the limitations on items you can bring for instance there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the cove and since i was on a scouting mission i ran out of shovels and couldnt complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious i saw in short the game has always been hard the game has always been out to get you and set you back on time youve spent playing it by getting your hardearned heroes killed with crits just like the intro says dd is about making the best out of difficult situations the game in its current state and with the way the developers have been taking it is pure masochism im not sure if the developers playtest their game because if i were them i sure as hell wouldnt want to if youve made it through this wall of text to this far please excuse me if i seem like im ing i actually like roguelikes and im familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently nobody likes being treated unfairly and it feels like the game is a chore if the idea was to make it stressful its just annoying on the plus side the developers are active and do create new content frequently but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid all in all if youre thinking of purchasing this game it might be a good idea to wait until its finished edit for clarity after seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics i figured id approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews since i do understand the mechanics the trinkets i feel like they simply arent balanced most of the ancestral legendary trinkets hurt more than they help for instance one gives 5 increased crit to melee but adds 5 stress damage to your characters that character will be targeted by stress attacks by the ai if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5 increased crit on the plus side at least this trinket works as intended the increased prices most people arent complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game harder it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the also the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher has this specific issue bugged me no not really curios honestly theyre not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now when you have a bank you want to overprepare now you cant you can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios healing the devs dont want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking but they also dont want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets so they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns then they add stress damage then they add increased stress damage for stalling then they add monster reinforcements has this ever affected me personally no because for the most part i manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons do i find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who already take a tedious and careful approach gut it and make the game even more tedious and punishing yeah but for for the most part this facet also hasnt really affected me facerolling do you have legendary heroes with max equipment and skills did they ever completely faceroll everything or do you still get your occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant yeah same here the game has never been too easy or too hard but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party one bad move one bad stress hit crit one bad bleed stack one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in a single battle the recent patches have made even nonroom battles more deadly class choices lets face it some classes are just underpowered i use the grave robber just because shes one of my favorites and shes a great support unit depending on where you are you can remove blight and bleed make her a dodge tank or turn her into a crit monster the jester and the man at arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her but her low health has always made her vulnerable guarantee shes going to hit deaths door at least once maybe three or four times if youre taking her to a boss battle i use her not always because shes the optimal choice but i like the concept with the new patch i pretty much only want to use bounty hunter for my scouter the houndmaster is pretty cool but again hes pretty underpowered as well weak 12 damage aoe hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight and thats the formless flesh in other words theres cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only one portion of the game also looking at you man at arms skill guard which doesnt always work by the way especially against the prophet in a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to faceroll things and do large amounts of damage the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched if anything it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon but compeltely acceptable for the games creators for the most part i tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game havent played it but for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop qqing there are legimate reasons why people dont like dd ive loved this game since the beginning but l dont like the direction the developers are taking it if you enjoy the game as it is please direct your butthurt elsewhere by the way nice job posting my review at the top of rdarkestdungeon and vote brigading the thumbs downs reddit,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,edit there has been some misunderstanding stemming from my opening lines the key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes darkest dungeon unique and rewarding to play darkest dungeon isnt just another rpg and i dont blame anyone for approaching it like one there are plenty of onscreen cues and tips that guide the player but for players who have played since the beginnings of early access its easy to overlook them and not start from square one players who are completely new to darkest dungeon are likely to heed these ingame suggestions and warnings at face value and may have a better experience as a result i do not think the game is perfect but its pretty great and worth your time and money to experience there are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played and i want to shed some light on why this game is actually amazing and has changed over time to become better there arent going to be any story spoilers here just basic mechanicsmore or less just the hamlets features and how they interact with the core gameplay it is a difficult game and it is an rpg when the going gets tough in a traditional rpg theres usually a couple ways to deal with that grinding monsters for money gear and experience completing sidequests and so on in darkest dungeon you have a variety of resources at your disposal you have heirlooms used to upgrade your hamlet facilities you have gold required to use your hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition you have trinketsa way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities and you have the heroes themselvesa renewable resource each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes resolve level sanity quirks disease equipment and spells heres the part where people go wrong they try to minmax they try to save their heroes theyll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out this game restricts your resources far too hard for that and makes your gains from doing so minisculeyou do make a profit but its tiny and takes a long time the profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost nonexistent and players see this as being the grindfest as they slowly approach the endgame often trying to circumvent this games difficult mechanics popular steam guides are guilty of this by grinding it out using strategies such as suicidegold runs which are a time sink in and of themselves adding to the grind illusion those narrow margins of profit the seemingly unending grind its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play and those players arent adjusting their gameplay progression through this games intense difficulty isnt made by grinding out the perfect heroes its by taking what you have and going for it youre going to fail youre going to lose heroes youre going to hit brickwalls but youre going to learn the absolute limits of every hero the absolute limits of your style of play and youll push those limits your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down bruteforcing a grind through the game is technically possible but you shouldnt do it this game wants you to face its depths headon and as soon as you do it drags you further down and constricts you even more when you finally get it thoughwhen you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the gamethere is very little more rewarding it doesnt happen because you grind it doesnt happen because you followed a strategyit happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this game rewards the chickenhearted stubbornly trying to finish a dungeon thats gone badly from the start leads to a deathmarch this game rewards the detailminded did you remember to unequip your trinkets did you reequip them did you check to see if that monster is going to easily resist that attack dude did you even make a provisions checklist this game rewards the heartless sometimes the best thing to do with a syphilic boozedup hero with a bad case of nerves is to fire her sometimes deciding to let her die of a heart attack gets you a shiny this game rewards the persistent not giving up after a humiliating party wipe is more of a key to success than flashes of tactical brilliance completing the game in less than 99 weeks each week is a dungeon run that takes up to half an hour is considered fast and gets you an achievement this game rewards the flexible sometimes you dont have a lot of choices your healers are all too diseased and crazy this week your tank went awol and your barbarian needs to have a pesky trait removed can you scrape together a viable party or maybe your tactics went well only up to a point will you come up with new ones or will you pack it in mumbling bitterly about the unfairness of it all its not for everybody,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,a truly fantastic game with a criminally low review rating this stems from the game having changed a fair bit since early access but all the changes have been positive making the game less exploitable is a good thing people the other complaints i hear are usually the rng is too severe no skill which is entirely untrue all rng in darkest dungeon can be avoided by careful planning and thought on my second run through the game i survived 100 weeks without a single death or a single quest failure and with only one resolve check encountered edit ive now finished the game twice consecutively with no deaths pros highly addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back for more tons of replayability as no run through the game is the same very strategic combat party compositions trinket speccing synergies the list goes on beautiful in every sense stunning artstyle effective animation fantastic soundtrack diverse and varied characters make for a lot of experimentation and fun fair difficulty curve challenging the whole way with difficult but achieveable boss fights at the end lots of content for the price unique regions to explore with thematic enemies and procedurally generated dungeons perfectly managed stress and health systems with intriguing deaths door and resolve check mechanics to keep you on your toes in and out of combat wayne junes narration is golden it sets the lovecraftian atmosphere perfectly and oozes quality with such sophisticated verbose vocabulary town events make things more varied in the hamlet for better and occasionally for worse somewhat frequent updates with new heroes new content bugfixes and finetuned mechanics cons a little beginner unfriendly in some places like cluttered tooltips lack of gamemechanic introduction etc the fact its not in your game library absolutely criminal theres plenty more praise i could sing this game but i should stop now this game captivated me and i fell deeply in love with it i hope other people do too after reading this review,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,not enough stress at home or work play this game and youll never be happy again,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,you should already know its a roguelike dungeon crawler with classes you recruit and send on dungeon crawls now that the game is officially released and postreleasepatched here is a new review the game is fantastic the different classes and abilities mean you can play two runs in a row with totally different battle play styles the narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton the concept works really well rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits money run or artifact run into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression the balance is imo really good you are low on things and people for a long time by design your dungeon crawlers die a lot by design but its all in service of the theme and as you rebuild and get better everything else gets better too also importantly they have added a lot of options to change the gameplay to make it easier by toning down or eliminating various types of difficulty i find the default difficulty fantastic but im also a big believer in letting people choose to turn off things they dislike i paid 20 for this the first week it was on steam and played it for over 100 hours while it was still in early access now that the final game is out and there are new classes and areas and story content that ive never seen i feel confidant that i will get another 100 hours as some one who never pays full price for a game this is a game i bought at full price and im glad i did,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,tldr see conclusion,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,if you were my friend on a budget and asking for my darkest dungeon review i would say dont buy this game it took me a while 30hrs to decide how i really and truly felt about darkest dungeon if you are looking to buy this game then you are probably like me a fan of difficult games dark souls comes to mind let me go ahead and give you the warning that i feel i didnt get from looking at reviewsthis game is not difficult in a way that is remotely satsifying when i play a difficult game i want to feel something after a tough battle i want to feel like i really earned my sword my armor my loot my gold i want to feel like all the progress ive made is deserved because i learned from my mistakes and overcame my ignorance of the worlds mechanics at some point i want to feel successful and look down upon this horrific world that ive made my way in and say heck yeah this place is scary but i have at last become one of those scary things in it darkest dungeon is not that game spoilers 1a stress damage too high stress damage sounds cool right very lovecraftian but the problem here is that you are already walking such a razor thin margin of success that all you need is for your main damage dealer to go insane to wipe the party each character has about 100pts of stress they can take before giving in to madnesswhich really isnt much when enemies do anywhere from 1520pts of stress damage per attack 1b immersion breaking there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of logic to what causes stress or how much you take seeing a reanimated corpse shambling towards me would stress me out more than getting splashed with a cup full of bloodespecially if i am a crusader leper or highwayman who isprobably used to being splashed with blood 2a trinkets i want to say that the items you use to boost your characters stats are worthless that isnt true its just that they are nearly worthless yes you can find the rares and you can get the ancients but the drawbacks are so significant that i almost never wanted to equip them a bracer that gives 25 damage yes please but it also gives 20 stress damagewhen im already taking 20 stress a hit 2b after playing darkest dungeon for 30hrs i have yet to find a single piece of loot that made me happy not a single one and for the life of me i cant understand why the developers went with such a harsh catch22 for all these items if i dont care about finding gear to boost up my characters then why am i even delving into these dungeons 3a the story 30hrs in and i am tired of hearing the narrator as he constantly sputter 12letter words ripped directly from the pages of your favorite lovecraftian horror story excusing that my problem with the story is that the narrator explains everything in the intro scene quite literally as you delve through the dungeon and find notebook pages you slowly come to the realization that they do not reveal anything new 3b immersion breaking i start to ask myselfwhat in the world am i doing down here maggots can apparently appear from thin air so its not like im going to live in this hellhole after i clear all the monsters and bandits out my ancestor is hecka dead soim not here to save anyone why am i sending all these people to die again i meanits not for money only people making money in this game are my vassals tavern owner abbey guild blacksmith who setting aside the fact that they are charging me straight out the nose for things apparently require i give them dozens of family portraits and land deeds in order to fulfill the orders that i just paid and continue to pay them for 4a the bosses back to dark souls 2 for a second one of the most frustrating fights for me was the gargoyles in the belltower more than almost any other fight it felt unfair as you get swamped from every direction skewered and suffer multiple deaths but eventually you get it you learn the pattern match it to your fighting style and succeed there is none of that here what seemed interesting and innovative to me in darkest dungeon was the number of classes and the combination of parties you could make but gradually you realize that some of the classes are truly worthless antiquarian comes to mind and even worse that the game requires that you bring certain classes to certain dungeons it curtails the way that you play and i am not at all a fan of paying money for a game only to have it pretty much micromanage my fun 4b immersion breaking the wizened hag after fighting six different room battles i finally come upon the hag only to discovershe sits in the back row behind an unbreakable cooking pot and cannot be moved literallycannot be moved so why in the world would you give me so many characters and abilites that change the enemies battle positions why give me a power and then say no not here where it might be used best after the wizened hag fight which i narrowly won thanks to a crusader with spear of light i looked up tactics for every single boss on the wiki something i would normally be ashamed to do on my first playthrough of any game why because im not about to lose 4 to 5 hours of gameplay and grinding because darkest dungeon in unfair not difficult but actually just unfair 5a darkest dungeon is simply unfair not in a sense of its okay i can still get through this limping through the dungeon kind of unfair but in a hey your characters are going to die today and thats all there is to it kind of unfair i have had a geared up team stunlocked to death by spiders in a hallway i sat for four turns all the spiders go all my team recovers from stun 1 turn while the spiders stunned marked and killed my team i have had enemies focus down my team one by one from the healer in postion 4 to the tank in postion 1 not with damage but with stress so that my characters pass instead of taking their turns and get picked apart i have walked into a hallway and gotten surprised at 90 light then walked into a room and gotten surprised at 80 light and then gotten surprised leaving that room into another hallway at 76 light i have watched as characters on my team repeatedly miss hitting the enemy 3 times in a row despite having no debuffs at all and then watched as enemies debuffed to detract from accuracy speed and damage proceed to get a critical hit every hit that takes my characters to deaths door and then the grave 6a these situations are common which brings me to my last point the game is unfair so there isnt a real reason to get attached to your characters so if you arent here to take your home back and you arent here to save your ancestor and you arent here to become fabulously wealthy and you arent here to lead a team of chosen warriors through hell and backwhat is the point of playing darkest dungeon i ask this knowing that there isnt one edit 5212016 at this point in time only 09 of people who have purchased darkest dungeon have beaten the game on normal 09 is from the global achievement stats which lists by percentage of all players,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,tl dr a fascinating game turns into a boring grindfest skip or wait for rebalance patch and its a pity cause i really like this game the combat is awesome and diverse the dark atmosphere is perfect the random nature of the game makes the dungeon runs very fun every single time overall this is a great game let down by two major factors 1 the catch22 equipment upgrades caused by the fact that your characters level far faster than you generate the necessary money for their upgrades so lets say youve leveled four of your characters from level four to level five theres a game mechanic where high level characters will refuse to go to low level dungeons which are beneath their dignity so the four champions can only do level 5 dungeons but you cant beat a level 5 dungeon without the equipment upgrades but equipment upgrades costs money but to get the money you need to beat the level 5 dungeon but the champions cannot beat it so to solve it you get a bteam doing the dungeons as well but then you need to spend money on the bteam the only solution is to recruit new characters recruiting level 0 characters is free and duing suicide runs with them which is extremely grindy and boring but this is nothing compared to 2 the endgame basically once your team of four best characters of the highest level the finest characters goes into the first level of the final dungeon and beats it they can never go there again so you level four more best characters for level two of the dungeon and they also cant go there again so you do it again for level three and level four assuming no one dies which is impossible this is 16 characters you need to level up to level 6 this is the worst game restriction ive ever seen i dont even know what to compare it with its like in skyrim you would have to start a new character from scratch for every single boss fight and for people saying this is hardcore no this is not hardcore stupid restrictions to artifically prolong the games life by making you do a ton of unnesessary work and grindfest are not hardcore with these two factors i cannot recommend the game in its current state,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,im awful at writing methodical comprehensive reviews so ill stick to bullet points like a basic presentation flawless the gritty comic book style creates for an intense and immersive atmosphere befitting of lovecrafts literary style gameplay hard to learn harder to master the games mechanics are complex and not always well explained this can be frustrating at times particularly when your band of heroes is steamrolled by a boss youve never encountered simply because you didnt know what to expect i recommend playing the game for a few hours beating a few bosses then skimming the wiki so you can better understand the indepth mechanics of the games rng nonetheless its amazingly fun and satisfying music perfect stuart chatwood did an amazing job on the soundtrack the music is also well implemented with the game mechanic of light making for some intense battles where you feel like a true badass voice acting theres only one voice actor wayne june and yet his performance easily lends to 50 of darkest dungeons enjoyability his succulent voice invades my ears like some obscure lovecraftian alien lifeform dialogue while i love junes lines and delivery my one complaint with the entire game is that around the end of my first playthrough i found myself tired of the repetitive lines from the characters and ancestor one can only hear the remind yourself line so many times before it loses its majesty in short i absolutely love the darkest dungeon it was worth every penny and more it even got me interested in lovecrafts stories given the new dlc coming in early 2017 i cant see any better time to pick up darkest dungeon is rly gud,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,its the summer sales i decide to write something to let more people experience the cool feeling of exploring dungeons fighting all kinds of monsters and mind breaking by those hideous creature in brief it is a roguelike plus simulation game in fact the player is running a small hamlet which was called hamlet of course this villiage is surrouded by different residential area where different styles of kind neighbours live the task is simple recruit your villains to plunder those neighborhoods then use the loot to reinforce your villain party and eventually kill the boss of those neighbor and lead your hamlet to the brightest world ive never been so close to the death,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,an excellent twist on the turnbased dungeon crawler darkest dingeon is a great game part management sim part dungeon crawler the game has you manage a collection of dungeon diving rpg heroes like in many similar games the difference is that your warriors are not singularly important if you lose a favored hero the game doesnt reload from a save or let you restart the dungeon that hero is gone and someone else will need to take his place thus its to your advantage to maintain a stable of heroes instead of that one party of your favorites a la xcom added to that your heroes arent delving into high fantasy dungeonscapes where good guys always win their journeys pit them against eldritch horrors that can drive them mad or reduce them to catatonic helplessness the cumulative affects of this end up being worse than mere death this is where the management part of the game comes into play your heroes need some time for rampr to help them forget the horrors of the deep and for that you maintain and upgrade a small town where they can pray to the gods for strength or drown their sorrows in the tavern in this game a cool idea meets excellent execution the art style is very cool while simultaneously representing the grim cthulu aesthetic couple that with the narration smooth controls and a ui that leaves all the important info readily available to you while simultaneously leaving the screen uncluttered so you can appreciate the dark beauty of the game the worst criticism that i can muster is that the music is forgettable like i have three hours in game as i write this and i cant remember what it sounds like even with all that a game that relies on combat so heavily could still fail if that combat is poorly done and otherwise not fun darkest dungeon has a combat system thats deep enough to offer many choices while not overwhelming you or forcing you to focus on minmaxing to get by this game is amazing my only regret about my purchase is that i didnt find it earlier,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,outdated review havent played it before its release so please take this review with a grain of salt it really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now not because it is hard or unfair sometimes now many more times after the last update i actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time so you can see im not one of i lost 50 characters this game is bad the problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies not to mention that there is little reward i cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new heroes get lucky with some quirks lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff when in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk i stopped caring for them why would i care for a vestal with higher hp dodge and speed if she can lose it all in a single turn why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them what is the point of making a character unique there is none period the devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks note they didnt get any single new attack their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics oh there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher well thats exactly when they start murdering the freedom i dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like what is the point of getting new trinkets try nem combinations of trinkets none thats that i dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could fyi i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run that is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game and the character is very fragile no high hp no way to buff his survival nothing ghuess what engage in a combat 2 round later his dodge was greatly decreased and that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party you can imagine how open the other 3 were im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well it sound terrible right but hey cant you buff your characters yes you can but here is the thing even if you have the highest level of buff skill you cant match the enemys debuff simply as that i think the aoe debuff i suffered is 10 for stack and that for low level characters you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons the highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9 exactly 9 from a high level character and a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values nevertheless even if the debuffs werent so severe i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you and in this rng based rpgdont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent even with top characters and trinkets you could face some really bad situations that can be very very dangerous but hey that is not over yet ohh you may start thinking what this is worse than it already is and the answer is yes heres the thing now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat that includes buffing and healing your party exactly it includes it and it can be even worse than that i was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived oh i was penalized because the guy survived no he didnt attack me or something i got a stress attack stress are almost a second health bar in this game if you let it go too high you might face serious serious problems in some extreme cases your character dies i gave up at that point i was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right what is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else youre wasting turns i dont feel like it anymore dont want to try new strategies specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to waste time taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die i have to write more about the trinkets as well for newcomers since they are one of the main rewards of the quests a great number of them include the most rare ones ancestral trinkets are useless or unworthy really the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other not so rare trinkets the same rule aplies to the very rare trinkets which is one tier below this happens because all of them have some drawbacks speed dodge that make them less worth to use and with the new patch more of them became even more useless which ends with the game being less rewarding and with all the bs the devs put now there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket the another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless you use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments you can only get new armor and weapon this way and you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group now the devs got a brilliant idea lets make the itens you buy limited yay its not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100 prepared for everything and you want the rewards well you can use gold to buy trinkets as well but the majority of them are useless so no reason anymore to have tons of gold and even less reason to play this game well that is why i gave up with this patch not willing to try finding better trinkets that are so few the majority of them you may not use ever and that list may have just got bigger since now youll have to focus on debuff res dont feel like trying to make builds for some places hero that gets more attacks hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time i waste creating one completly unrewarded and the freedom i had to try new party compositions new strategies finding sinergy with skills is vanished since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me cant go with a party that is slow but safe have to go with higher risk but like i said many times no reward for me i really enjoyed this game i really did even in times i felt it was unfair i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them now since the best the devs have done to rise the challenge is simply make it even more luck based than ever i gave up they crossed the line of hard but rewarding to luck and unrewarding and i cant feel any longer the will to play it praying that my group gets luck that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight that isnt skill reliable whoever think it is is completly mistaken gonna miss the art music dialogue and lore from this game but unless the devs do something about this i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube far more enjoyable for me and less stressful,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,excellent turn based dungeon crawler with a punishing difficulty and a great oppressive atmosphere stylish detailed 2d art style h p lovecraft inspired enemies ranging from skeleton warriors to tentacle faced monsters godlike voice acting the narrator sounds like a cross between that dude who does movie trailers and optimus prime from tansformers this game is hard like ninja gaiden on the nes hard the rng hates you and you will be screwed over when you think youre doing really well but thats kind of the point it runs like a dream and overall feels really well made and polished frequently updated with new content so theres a lot of content here for your money not recommended for people who are easily frustrated love it,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,a flawed but fun dungeon crawler with a fantastic aesthetic theme and an emphasis on tactical combat and roster management darkest dungeon is a very streamlined gameplay experience the exploration segments have a fairly small number of decision points characters have a limited number of moves to select from in combat and character building is limited to a small number of skill and item choices on the one hand the game lacks somewhat for depth as a result of this aggressive minimalism on the other hand its freed of a lot of pointless micromanagement that plagues more detailed games the concept is that you have a smaller number of more meaningful decisions to make although i cant say the execution is without its flawstoo many decisions are plagued by trap options leaving the player with fewer real choices than they should have its still fun but has room to improve generally though the tactical elements are pretty decent there is a large element of randomness but the game does a good job of providing tools to mitigate risks careful and thoughtful play is consistently rewarded but there is a strong riskreward element to the gameplay so if you play fast and loose you can still accomplish amazing things if youre luckyor die horribly if youre not the highlight of the game is definitely the aesthetics the art direction is awesome the voice work is superb and the story while sparse is surprisingly good the tactile feel of combat is extremely enjoyable the games themes and motifs are woven throughout the art story and gameplay in a really satisfying and cohesive way the ending while somewhat predictable is executed brilliantly most dungeon crawlers have the bare minimum of story necessary to explain why the player is off to kill monsters and collect loot so getting an interesting narrative out of the ending sequence was a pleasant surprise its a very well done piece of horror that does bring us to the elephant in the room the grind dungeon crawlers generally tend to be largely about grinding when you get down to it and darkest dungeon is not really an exception its got 14 classes to play with and heavily encourages eventually outright forces you to use more than 4 characters so theres enough diversity in the roster to keep gameplay somewhat fresh and interesting and the difficulty curve is well done with enemies picking up new tricks to challenge you throughout the game even so there are points where the game ends up dragging a full campaign is likely to take 3040 hours which is a huge time commitment for a relatively simple game the game could really have been shaved down by 5 or 10 hours without really losing anything in general i would recommend darkest dungeon if you want to play a streamlined version of old school dungeon crawlers with a major roster management component youd like to see a game pull off a gritty gothic horror theme and turn classic rpg archetypes on their head you enjoy tactical combat optimization that doesnt get bogged down in minutiae on the other hand you may consider staying away if you get very attached to your characters in rpgs and hate when bad things happen to them you enjoy micromanagement and having control over a lot of fine details youre a fan of traditional heroic fantasy narratives and love seeing the good guys win,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon is a 2d turnbased dungeon crawler created by red hook studios upon starting the game you are greeted with the news that a dear estranged relative of yours has been up to some pretty bad stuff and essentially leaves you to clean up his mess the mess in question being the multitude of ghouls horrors and other assorted neerdowells that now inhabit the family manor and the hamlet that surrounds it this is the premise of darkest dungeon and it works as well as any other to start our adventure the bulk of the game revolves around leading a group of four characters through an assortment of randomly generated dungeons and doing battle with the creatures that inhabit them characters traverse the dungeons in single file their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them for instance some characters will do better on the front line while others will thrive at the back of the group setting up your group is key to a successful endeavour this is where the games hub comes into play the hamlet is a small group of shops and buildings that acts as the games main hub from here you are able to make use of a wide variety of amenities as you decide which heroes to send out on their next adventure and with what supplies to pack new heroes are able to be recruited from the stage coach armour and weapons upgraded at the blacksmith diseases and quirks cured at the sanatorium as well as many other services being available for the right price this includes spending money to reduce the effect of one of the games main mechanics stress stress is an ingame measurement of a particular heros mental state a counter that goes from 0 to 200 if the heros stress reaches 100 they will gain an affliction or have a chance to become virtuous while a virtuous hero will only benefit your team with buffs and stress reduction an afflicted hero has the complete opposite effect increasing the stress of those around them and sometimes actively putting themselves in danger or ignoring your command completely if your stress becomes too high your hero is at risk of a heart attack which may kill them outright this may be compounded by the games quirk system where in certain situations a hero will develop a positive or negative quirk that will affect how they act or how you must treat them these can range from increased stress gain to a compulsive need to examine every item you come across and many more when it comes to presentation darkest dungeon gets full points the gothic 2d art style oozes personality without being overly busy or confusing and a good use of depth of field stops the game from feeling flat the interface is incredibly well designed and remains simple despite the amount of information housed within there are a few changes i would make to make viewing information a little easier but overall the interface does what it sets out to do very well the graphic style of darkest dungeon conveys the mood of the game perfectly and only strengthens its theme especialy when paired with the terrific audio design and the phenomenal voice acting of the narrator the audio design in this game is on another level when stacked up against its peers as the light fades so too does the musics simple nature giving way to an erratic tune that becomes more maddening the more you venture forth the weighty sounds of attacks as your group goes toe to toe with all manner of horrors and of course the absolutely shiver inducing tones of the loquacious narrator as he pontificates about his venerable house and the arcades of antiquity all of these elements come together to make darkest dungeon and absolutely unforgettable experience the feeling of felling an enemy with a perfect strategy leaves you in awe of yourself as a brilliant tactician while other times becoming absolutely downtrodden as you lose the hero youve been cultivating for so very long darkest dungeon is a game about making the best out of what you are given and sometimes when life gives you lemons well i hope you like lemons overall my experience with darkest dungeon has been incredibly satisfying having put 40 hours into the game i can see that i am in fact not even close to finishing nor do i feel the fatigue that i usually would after playing most any other game for such a long period of time when i first saw it in early access i was itching to play it but decided to hold off and wait until the developers were confident enough to say that it was a finished product and i am so glad that i did if you are a fan of xcom or dont mind a bit of punishment to get true satisfaction out of your gaming experience then i dont have any problem telling you that darkest dungeon is a must play if you enjoyed this review consider leaving a thumbs up or if you have some constructive feedback to leave feel free to comment,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon is a game that shows you how dangerous and foolhardy it is to grab a torch and go down into dark depths to face the beings who reside there and i love it every step i take darkest dungeon is a challenging dungeon crawler where your characters must combat stress read sanity as well as the beasties that lie in the darkness as they search for fame fortune and glory it really takes heavy cues from hp lovecraft on how man was not meant to see what lies just beyond the torchlight it uses a turn based system and rpg elements as well as some cues taken from roguelike games such as permadeath the game rewards quick thinking in a bad situation and preparation and priorities can truly determine weather your party comes out from the caves alive or are ripped to shreds by nameless horrors the art style is phenomenal and youd be hard pressed to find a indie game with such evocative soundtracks and voiceover the narrator makes you feel the success of a critical hit and heartache of a fatal blow you grow attached to your party members just to see them die from a poor decision some people may cry that the computer can pull these amazing succession of criticals leaving your characters ripe for slaughter next turn but ive found that if you prepped correctly prioritized your healing and use status effects like bleed and blight to your advantage youll make it by the skin of you teeth and escape the dungeon in this game you gotta know when to call it quits and leave the dungeon with what loot you can carry its ok to run and come back another day with a stronger party and better supplies then to lose a character youve upgraded significantly and i love that about this game in hp lovecrafts stories it is rarely a happy ending and this game holds to those themes tightly in the end i would recommend this game but only to those that have the patience and understanding of the mindset you have to have when facing the terrors of the abyss if you go in foolhardy youll end up simply making more loot for the party that comes in after as they pillage the nameless corpse of another failed adventurer,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,early access what early access this game is amazing as it is oh man i cant even begin to imagine what will it look like when finished i bought the game during the summer sale 2 days ago and i easily clocked in close to 17 hours already and that is already telling dont you think but lets not get ahead of myself as usual i will take a look at the good and the bad this review is as of build 9007 with the man at arms and the arbalest included along with the new bosses the good 1 ironman this game is for true roguelike genre fans the ones that do not whine and complain in the face of adversity and overwhelming odds but for ones who seek options and avenues of advancement to combat this adversity 2 roguelike at its best you never know what the game will offer you you need to cope with the resources at your disposal for example you may be forced into weeks and weeks of hardships simply because the game wont pity you enough to give you another vestal or occultist character but instead shower you with tanks and pitiful healers 3 procedurally generated dungeons while you could try to assume and predict based on the area you chose to explore layouts they are still largely random so you need to plan ahead big time fight or flee has never been a bigger wrench of a choice beforeor that what if queston on the back of your mind 4 memorable stories the game creates stories on its own for example how you got wiped twice forced into meager runs but managed to get back on your feet and actually complete all the objectives or say how you were forced into a 4 highwayman run cause you had nothing else to use or how your cleric went crazy and abusive and started britchingp about anything others do which tunred into an avalanche of abusive stressed out individuals who care not about each other those things are in the game this is one of the few games that makes you go to the forums or post a status about what happened just to vent off or share with your friends 5 various missions every time you complete a mission you get a different set of consequential encounters for you to choose all of them with various objectives and varying rewards 6 bosses there are a number of bosses in the game each one with different mechanics meaning you need to bleed boil and hurt till you learn what the boss does best and how to best combat himher it 7 your very own minivillage for you to develop as you see fit will you neglect armor and weapons for the sake of more skills and buffs during camping will you choose to be skilled and better equipped and protected but suffer everything the rngesus throws at you cause you didnt upgrade the amount of new heroes who want to join you and the means of reducing stress through the abbey or the tavern all up to you and my it is a big deal to select a good path of advancement this alone creates memorable stories to post and share 8 varying areas each with its own enemies expectations and bosses 9 the light system which alone makes for very interesting gameplay more stress but more loot a normal run or a safer run with less loot but little stress and lots of happy characters up to you 10 wonderful level progression system with a set number of skills per character and quirks you gain for completing dungeons or various other conditions 11 being dark and moody making you crigne when something happens it only enhances the experience 12 value for the money i like judging my game hours like 1 for 2 or 1 for 3 for bigger games so for every 1 euro i pay i expect 2 to 3 hours of gameplay i can tell you i could do 10 times the price i paid for this game 13 i have come back to the game since the review and i was absolutely baffled by the amount of content the devs actually dumped in well done people lets go darkest dungeoning again the bad 1 early access yeah many features are still missing even if the game is great as it is 2 ironman the game is extremely punishing sometimes to the point of frustration some enemies can crit you out and kill a character while youre gaping at the screen with a holy crap ready to roll out of your mouth 3 you get to work with what youre given you may find yourself sorely lacking in resources passable heroes meager parties and worse 4 cheesing out the game can be cheesed out to make more money and save yourself from a dire situation or to win a mission somehow 5 there is a stupid caretaker that may occupy the only freaking place where your most valuable character has to go to relieve stress 6 dungeon layouts may completely foil your plans 7 wipes and bad stuations yeah it can happen especially while you still dont know what youre doing and what each thing does 8 character balance characters are not perfectly balanced as of yet then again this game being a roguelike dont mind having an underdog in my party just because i dont have anything else to use conclusion buy this game simple as that you will spend lots of gameplay hours on it in its early access i would say 30 to complete all the caretakers goals and lots more when the game gets fully released that being said while i am a tad generous with the play time for a single run i have 2 separate playthroughs as i wanted to see the game from 2 different standpoints and i can easily say that those playthroughs are as different as the sun and the moon this is downright amazing and i sure as hell hope they will continue adding content this way there are still 2 more areas to unlock in the future and they are surely going to be amazing,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,what can i add to some of the great reviews available on this game well nothing really but the message to all potential buyers that here is one of those games that really satisfies in every aspect of gaming i found the difficulty a breaking point at first but once i kept at it and learned more and more about the games features and there are many it became more and more addictive lead a party of different warriors into the locations and you will have to deal with all their flawed character traits they all have some traits to discover that can seriously impact their performance and rising fear up till heartattack level plus fight enemies in turnbased combat luckily you have numerous ways to keep those things in check if prepared well and used well potions bandages spells and weapon upgades will all be available once you level up and when youre back in town theres all those buildings where you can restore the health weapons and fear or morale issues visit a tavern gamble away or sneak to a brothel find blessings and conquer fear in the monastery this is all just the tip of the iceberg the whole game is drenched in atmosphere the art work is sublime and dark there are no bugs that i have found and the music is perfectly suited for some dangerous adventuring to find out the curse of the manor like i said it takes some time to get to know all the possibilities but that only feels more satisfying once you master those this is a game that every lover of turnbased rpgs should have no doubt about it,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i want to start by saying i had already played this game in the past before there were even secondary bosses or a cove area and i did so for very very long it was an intensely fun and rewarding experience and it absolutely made me think it would be money well spent to acquire it for myself when it was finished hell id have payed twice its price tag to get a completed game which was that enjoyable i received it as a gift from a friend recently and was positively overjoyed i could not wait to come back and see all that was added in this past half year i created a new save file started playing and despaired but i decided to keep playing and to not stop playing until i had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer so it is now after over 30 hours of gameplay time that i want to write this review and say that i do not in any way or form recommend this game as it currently is it is no longer the game i played back then it has changed into something that is barely recognizable it is technically the same game but it most definitely does not feel the same and it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment ive read many bits and pieces of sometimes conflicting information as to why this happened namely a highlyvocal group of fans steering this game into its sad current state developers which have a very particular vision for this game and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could afford so before i get into any details i want to make this clear i am not familiar to any such forum drama i do not know who holds the blame and i have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today the one thing i know for certain is it did change badly this game is now unquestionably an antifun game by antifun i dont mean overly hard i dont mean overly grindy i dont mean overly complex i mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it practically all enjoyment is gone all progression feels meaningless for the most part all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever chief among the worst offenders are two mechanics corpses and heart attacks and yes i know you can turn corpses off but then we are not playing the game the way its meant to be played we are not experiencing all it has to offer and so to elaborate heart attacks having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before in a good way it was a challenge to be overcome it was an entertaining encumbrance that lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough and youd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves refusing heals shuffling about acting on their own and a lone hero who passed the virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition it was a predicament it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all but it was fun this is not the case anymore stress accumulation is now roughly 23x higher than it once was everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously and it doesnt stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable no now it never stops and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating training and equipping the heroes that will inevitably die from it at some point you used to be able to bring a mildlystressed hero on an expedition doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will fail i will not even touch with a 10foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right and will simply leave it at this is not fun this is not acceptable even it is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress something you cant effectively heal from is an everpresent threat of almost instant death which thanks to this games unforgiving rng and mechanics is very usually the same as instant death heart attacks could maybe maybe be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress and this is still a very big maybe but as it is it is undeniably an antifun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control corpses this is by far the worst offender of the two and thats without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach this mechanic kills the utility of certain classes artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which for the most part are otherwise generally useless and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason enemies are never inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them and even then most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction it is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target thats out of reach thus taking more damage and stress for again no reason whatsoever but i want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isnt a critical hit which is like 90 of all killing blows give or take if the enemy is killed by a critical hit bleed damage or blight damage there wont be a corpse but if the enemy is bleedingblighted and is killed with a regular attack there will still be a corpse that is bleedingblighted for some eldritch reason if the enemy doesnt have those last 2 hp taken by bleed or blight damage it suddenly turns into a corpse that can take a load more bleed and blight damage absolutely fantastic if the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage there wont be a corpse if the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage there will be a full hp corpse being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important which is their damage both of the above points happen for a very simple reason artificial difficulty forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you wont be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the rngs by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit and not just a powerful hit because attacking bleedingblighted enemies or hitting neardeath enemies with powerful skills so that they wouldnt leave corpses behind those would be things the player could control and we wouldnt want that now would we in order to make corpses borderline bearable at least the following changes would be needed any enemy that dies while bleedingblighted would leave no corpse any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpses hp for example if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 hp the corpse would lose 3 hp right as it spawned and again this is so corpses would be more bearable it is no substitute for the fact that much like heart attacks they shouldnt exist at all this is a game i loved and im actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in but i cannot at all recommend this game regardless i will update this review once the game is completed update game is completed nothing really changed,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this is a tough one but to sum it up i just cant recommend the game there are some bright spots first and foremost the atmosphere is great the narration is just so on point and it really gets you going then the game starts and its just draws you right in the game goes great the rougelike keeps its interesting with permadeath and the random stat changes can keep the characters interesting the art is fantastic the areas seem interesting and deep then the turn evetually though the game switches it really stops being fun it becomes a grind with a capital g now i actaully enjoy the grind mostly played rpgs all my life and there can be something nice about grinding however this game swtiches so hard from the fun of exploring and a very real adventuring sense to this massive grind that it is jarring and incredibly unfun the game turns into work there is no progression you feel from anything for a long long long time due to the atrociousness of the grind the other flaws really start to show the rng becomes a bit unbearable rng can be really fun and leave a sense of the unexpected in the air however when its combined with the mt everest of a grind it becomes this ulgy mechanic that can just ruin any gameplay for instance you are forced to run the same area for the millionth time just to grind out some charcters when rng strikes and you lose someone important this sucks so much not that permadeath is bad or that rng permadeath cant offer really fun games but because that it wasnt due to anything you decided you didnt take a risk you didnt overextend you didnt do anything the game forced you into a boring task and then punished you for it anyways then you realize the maps are the same the monsters are the same everything is the same the rougelike randomness and vareity of monsters in each area that started off very cool has become so very boring simply becuase you spend a lifetime in each area trying to grind things out and switching back and forth does little to break this up due to the sheer number of times you have played a map there it is sad it is an amazing game off the bat you will love it right away then it will slowly make you hate it dread turing it on it becomes a job you cant stand the polar oppostie of civs one more turn instead being ugh do i have to,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,so after seeing this game released and finished i can finally say it its nice to see the early access state to finished barely changed anything except add in more fake difficulty pros really really good artwork and style some animations could be a tad better but theyre mostly 99 good most of the time an interesting gimmick of stress and the psychological horrors that adventuring could have unique quirks system making every hero feel slightly different interesting classes all with unique dialogue pretty simple game to grasp more game options to get rid of unwanted gameplay aspects super easy to mod the devs even encourage modding in case anyone wants to know just make a comment in the review asking how and i will be glad to share on how to mod the game deaths door to prevent complete and utter instakillsgive a fighting chance wayne june does an amazing job as the ancestor honestly i would say its the best thing about this game cons the gimmick of stress is just one huge annoyance the chances of actually getting into 100 is by doing a dark run or getting gimmicked by stress attacks heart attacks 1 stress takes many years to actually start having health issues you dont have a heart attack instantly 2 if you get hit by it once you now go to instadeaths door a second time bye bye hero quirk system most are just annoyances that once again are just gimmicks disease system most are again annoyances however it needs more balancing ie hero gets black plague throw hero away or cure it because they literally cant help now hero get rabies leave it its more of a buff than anything hero gets griping in the guts annoying but its easy to get around afflictions and virtue chances virtue chances are so low i think it might be possible for someone to have 100 hours into the game and never get a virtue afflictions are major gimmicks reducing nearly every stat for the hero and making them do random things you can generally keep going with an affliction but if the player has more than about 2 rooms you will have to cut off the run short only to do nothing above why does it do nothing its mainly a farm and grind game any gold you need can easily be obtained just by slamming heroes into dungeons with or without supplies the upgrades to the town make it to were you need less gold everything is an infinite amount of gold and heirlooms because everything is an infinite supply including heroes it makes it more smart to upgrade your town first rather than try and play normally heroes are on infinite supply no matter what this game will never truly be hard if theres no true way to lose since gold and heirlooms can be farmed if you lost all heroes without upgrading the stagecoach what happens 4 fresh heroes right there champion dungeons become a long slow tedious grind to the boss it also requires some serious number crunching and near perfect min max team comp leaving barely any room for expirements the only way you can figure out this game is legitimately rolling low numbers on purpose is modding how perfect example as a joke i made the jester funny stats for a funny character do 09999 damage with a modifier of 100 damage increase he would constantly hit from 20004000 you start off with 67 of a death resist i even increased it to about a 75 they still have a good chance of dying from 1 hit the numbers round down a double edged blade to an extent since it also applies to the enemies need an example a vestal can heal for 78 adding a trinket that gives a 33 heal buff lowest heal she can get is 9 931 to be precise highest would be 10 1064 precisely instead of rounding up when it hits a 5 and above it rounds down this effects the player mostly though because even if they still get rounded down the enemies can outdamage any negative things that happen class balance is fine for the most part except the classes that outperform the others outperform them heavily a vestal can never outheal any damage only prolong them from death an occultist he can not only have the best debuff in the game but outheal the damage to a character hellions best meleer in the game why shes the only class in the game that can hit ranks 23 while in rank 13 and 4 in rank 1 lepers cry because once they get pushed to rank 3 they literally cant do anything worthwhile when theyre in ranks 12 they can only hit enemy ranks 12 does he have the damage to make up for it for a normal class sorta hellion though shes barely a few points off of leper damage except she can add a bleed dot dots bleed is pretty much the only good dot blight upon hit does 0 damage and at max rank does a dot of a whopping 7 yay a hellion could basically hit for that along with a bleed that does about 3 damage i dont understand red hooks obsession with blight doing no damage however you need some dots because of prot and champion dungeons with all these recent patches they added prot which was a means of prolonging the fight to make it harder meaning use some more dots just for them also there is no possible way you can get up to the jacked prot the enemies have the best you will get will probably be 15 using both trinket slots these devs constantly buff enemies while nerfing heroes matter of fact the entire every team is viable has been bogus since the release of the game and has only be stomped more into the ground with these stupid nerfs final level is filled with nothing but stress gimmicks and enemies that tank granted they can do a lot of damage esp with crits dots that wants you to min max a team theres a slight more but i wont touch on them except the crazy annoying doomsayer him i hope they remove him his yelling sounds like some bad cheesey low budget porno that doesnt make any sense tldr version the game is good if youre gonna play a small amount and then move on if you plan to spend a lot of hours in it pass or wait for about a 75 sale at least also the doomsayer ing remove him already side note before i get stormed by im bad casual not helpfuls etc i have played enough hard games and even relatively obscure games dark souls not really obscure but hard but fair which a i call bull and beaten it legend of grimrock 1amp2 pillars of eternity a few ys games and more i can say this game would be good for a mobile up until champions which can take up to an hour from the tankiness of enemies i am very far from bad casual etc its just the way the game plays its just meat grind simulator till you can use heroes leveled etc specific heroes too and then it becomes 95 of the time the house wins game huge time sink to even start in the higher level dungeons honestly veteran is the most fun that can be had and that was ruined by the crit focus every battle side side note i have feeling the people upvoting this generally agree with what i have to say but if you have read this far please tell others to not just mindlessly upvote bad andor good reviews it doesnt help anyone and it can possibly even mix opinions and facts for example if one says x game is bad because it requires too much number crunching whereas another one says x game is bad because it seems like the devs wanted you to be a 2 year old to play then yeah kinda hard to truly tell where opinions and facts start and end so please try to spread the word of dont upvotedownvote till you know where this review is coming from also dont upvote memes and joke reviews it once again hurts to see where facts and opinions mix just vote funny and move on,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,im not going to tell you what darkest dungeon is about in terms of gameplay since thats something that you can easily learn from the store page of course i just want to express my conclusions on the game after beating it its wonderful really especially if you love lovecraft like i do the overall aesthetic the sound design the narrative everything looks great and polished combat feels very satisfying and has you literally scream in joy and terror in front of the screen its awesome theres a ton of content too it took me more than 70 hours to beat the game its also very possible to do it in a much shorter time of course but this can be quite a stressful experience aswell not just for your heroes but for you the player while i found most of the campaign to be very enjoyable the endgame really killed most of my enthusiasm and almost got me to the point of giving up playing to just watch the ending on youtube this is because the game gets very grindy during the final quests the darkest dungeon is a pretty rough place and it will probably kill many of your heroes and unless you send legendary heroes your party will be dead long before it can explore the dungeon enough to give a clear notion of how the various mobs and bosses fight and remember that there can be no retreat from that place without at least one dead hero the grinding aspect kicks in when you realize that you dont have the legendary heroes you need for a particular quest and that you have to train new ones up to level six in order to get a single chance to succeed even if you win a darkest dungeon quest the survivors will permanently refuse to embark on the following ones thus becoming useless yet the game does actually provide you with some hints so that you can immediately guess which heroes you should bring in a particular quest in the dungeon lets imagine that you are tasked with killing a boss and that maybe the name of said boss can help you plan your party composition before you start the mission but since i was too dumb to notice such hints i finally decided to use a guide to beat the last missions of the game i guess im just not that good with this kind of games i cant come up with particularly good strategies in terms of party composition so that my chances of victory often depend on rng and luck plus this is not dark souls or super meat boy you will be punished even though you dont deserve it many have criticized the importance of rng in darkest dungeon but its a necessary element in a game that wants you to feel stressed whenever your heroes do that said i did beat the game with default difficulty options you can toggle off some mechanics in order to make your experience less frustrating if you feel you cant stand the overall difficulty of the game youll probably be labelled a casual from hardcore players and you wont be given a particular achievement when you beat the game but who cares your heroes will go crazy during the adventure make sure you dont the fact that you are given an option to customize the overall difficulty of the experience is the main reason why i would recommend darkest dungeon to anyone even those who are not familiar with the genre its probably still going to hit you hard even in casual mode but as the game tells you there can be no victory without madness edit 12 march 2016 the antiquarian update solved most of the issues i had with the endgame so most of what i said above about grinding should no longer be of concern great job developers,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,even if at the time i purchased this when everybody and his dog was posting gameplay videos of it on youtube this was a unique and very promising title thus my desire to support the devs even in early access as of late they have started balancing the game using cheap illogical and lazyass game mechanics slapped on top of previously slapped cheap illogical and lazyass mechanics without giving all that much thought whether those would actually fix anything and their impact on the game not to mention whether lorewise those would make any sense whatsoever which seems to be a trend with this studio they come up with game mechanics to fix problems real or imagined but never actually think whether those would be fun or fit the lore not to mention being logical which in the end brings more of a repetitious tedium than anything else without fixing much if anything even worse some of those new game mechanics introduce new problems which get fixed in the same fashion all of that resulted in an illogical frustrating and very much grindy experience the truly spoton art style music and narrator could no longer offset the tedium and as such the game simply became unfun to the point where this happened httpwwwthejimquisitioncomdarkestdungeonandtheperilsofearlyaccess as a result of which jim sterling as a steam curator eventually decided to take down his own early access recommendation for this game on a related note this is a relevant read as well the devs desire to make the game harder for the sake of it and there is only one difficulty setting with no plans for adding more thus meant that for example highertier maggots in dungeons had more armor than even your best armored crusaders in one of the previous patches maggots why because this is how this studio decided to increase the game difficulty where each maggot was basically like a terminator sent back from the future to end your line they introduced more randomness for the sake of randomness grinding for the sake of prolonging the content and introduced an overall fake difficulty increase clad in the impenetrable armor of tedium because according to the devs this is supposedly a roguelike game which it really isnt this is basically xcom with ironman permanently on but with cthulhu monsters instead of aliens and a lot more illogical randomness it has randomly generated and very generic dungeon layouts hero permadeath and a single automatic save and thats it it has no fail state you literally cannot lose according to this it also never will it will have even more grinding though a lot more once the last fifth endgame dungeon is implemented it will require you to finish multiple missions as it were in it only unlike the other four dungeons it would not allow you to retreat in case things get hairy which means that if your heroes fail their mission they will perish trying which is perfectly fine problem is in case your heroes are victorious they will get a perk preventing them from doing more missions in the endgame dungeon effectively forcing you to grind more heroes from level 0 no you cannot hire higher level heroes in the other four dungeons as to attempt to finish the game basically you have to grind one full party of heroes per endgame mission and that is assuming you finish them all at first attempt yeah despite the game being in early access and the devs constantly proclaiming that they appreciate and value player feedback such game altering changes are never put out for public testing prior to release even if steam allows beta patches to be installed by those who want to do so and test such changes before they make it into the live build such changes are also never discussed or even listed anywhere prior to coming to the live build it is literally expected that people would simply take them for what they are like them and praise the devs for their hard work communication with these devs is strictly a oneway street and takes the form of their patch notes criticism was simply ignored in the past now it is actively censored with people often getting banned and their whole post history outright deleted all of this has had its effect according to this steamspycom the game sold more than 400 000 copies on steam so far but according to this steamchartscom between sales and major patches on average 700800 people play it which put into perspective means that only 02 of the owners of this game actively play it for what it is the other 998 do not and as of writing this the numbers are still falling in its current state as an early access title i really cannot recommend this game as a matter of fact id advise you to stay away from it the developers do not seem to have a clearcut vision of what their game is to be seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly thoughout game altering patches sometimes game breaking in terms of fun and since they neither ask for nor heed any player feedback there doesnt seem to be much hope of them getting this right by the time it is officially released which as of writing this is 3 months or so away as a conclusion id like to add that this is not my first early access game nor is it the most expensive some of my other early access games have been basically completely abandoned by their devs and never got finished as such but despite all that darkest dungeon is the early access game that managed to convince me once and for all to never ever buy into early access games again,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i gotta say it is the first time im making a that huge review of a game but this game is really worth doing it i bought it on the first day of release after watching a few reviews i really hoped that all of that was said wasnt that frustrating because the game really seemed to be unique welldesigned and even drawn as good as a bob ross painting i gotta say that my first impression were excellent there was absolutely nothing that really dissapointed me every dungeons classes buildings gave me a great feeling of god theres so much different things to do and try and the first ten hours because i like to take my time were the funniest hours ive spent on a game since a few years every characters or class feel unique they all have their quality and flaws they have damage or debuff or dot or even healprotect skills they have some kind of specialities like multitargeting or crit or dot and even some great art every building have a good impact on the game and makes you feel doing what you are doing for a reason theres also torch management inventory and objects management as some object can be really usefull on fights stress management etc i mean theres a lot of great thought features that will make you be really really happy at the beginning yeah everything was fine fun balanced and so much more until i reached the level 5 part of the game the maximum level is 6 by the way then monsters began to be completely unfair most of them are going from 10hp 0 protection 10 dodge and 610 damage to 2650hp 35 protection 36 dodge and a ridiculous increase of damage some hits for 30 crit even with 25 damage reduction no jokes you might think its fair if you didnt buy the game yet because you can upgrade your heroes but the main problem comes from the fact that if you upgrade to maximum your characters overall theyll win 5 damage10 accuracy depends of the class though 1020hp and 10 dodge and they still have a completely unbalanced factor of damageheal like going from 58 damage to 714 what that means for real is that the only thing that really matters is how lucky you are melee characters cant hit anymore and will miss 40 of their attacks even with a huge accuracy boost ranged character will deal the same amount of damage to opponent than they previously were on level 1 because of the insane protection boost on monsters and will even miss 13 of their attacks heals will go from 46 to 610 even fully upgraded which cant follow the damage upgrade of your ennemies you feel like being completely torn apart every fight and struggle to make your characters survive even for a single turn the stress management becomes impossible to handle as on 100 stress most of your characters will begin to pass their turn wound themselves disagree to get healed or use the wrong skill and you have to surrender most of the dungeons after 4 rooms because even 1 firecamp break wasnt enough to make them feel better if you didnt lose someone already some classes will survive and do some things but 60 of the other class theres 15 on the game will struggle so much that its just impossible to use them youll have to spend half the gold you made to treat some disease that are impossible to avoid to treat their stress as even if you are the best coach in the world its impossible not to reach the 100 bars on at least 3 of your heroes and skills that reduce stress are mostly useless btw which gives the game a more frustrating than hard feeling after 40 hours of gameplay i never tried the level 6 dungeon of the game and the only level 5 dungeons i made were short ones theres a terrible grinding of gold to do because of how much youll need to spend after every dungeon but when you think afterwards its the most fun part of the game because youll farm gold on level 1 balanced dungeons with funnyoriginal strats or composition i first thought that i was just bad or making bad decisions but after trying so much builds classes and reading a lot of people reviews its just sad to say but the game is not fun at all on the endgame losing character is a point of the game as the developpers said but if you lose them because its really hard or you took a critical strike or your heal get stunned on the wrong turn its pretty funny actually it happens its a part of the roleplay etc youll have to be more careful or change your trinkets to decrease the odds of death happening next time but here its just completely luck based and you feel like you got absolutely no chances of winning and all the odds are against you the only hope you have is if your character land the critical hit of his life that you needed which means that 118 of the time itll be an okay fight only because of luck none of your management has a real impact if i can add one last thing is that your characters have positions which basicly allows them to use some different skills great feature i have to say but what i find unfortunate is that this positionning has impact on your heroes only its changes nothing for the opponent they do whatever they want to whoever they want it would be even more fun if your positions changed the amont of dodge or damage you take of even damage you deal or accuracy i dont know which could make tank be a real thing or healer be less vulnerable it would actually give a certain amount of strategy and credit to the combination of heroes you try to make dont get me wrong i got no regrets for buying this game and it is still terribly fun on the early part but theres a huge difference as everybody said between the games involves dying because it is hard and pure frustration pure madness pure luck to make a comparison when you play roulette you choose the amount and the numbers you bet on here its like watching the bet table only allowed to bet all your money on a single number as you are not even changing your odds of winning dying or whatever every time you enter a level 5 dungeon or equipping different trinkets i still have to give a huge shout out to the developpers who did overall an absolutely beautiful and enjoyable game one that we were waiting for a long time one that is beating most of the other games out there and even big studios ones but i hope that the future updates will give a brighter future to the game and that unfair points will change to hard points as more and more players are reviewing this game badly because of the sames problems over and over again edit for all those who says you need to watch a playthrough on internet etc well if the point of the game is to take the same characters as an internet guy and do the exact same thing because other things dont work as intended it breaks completely all the dnd discover by yourself experiment point of the game which is to me the best point of all i took the vestal for healing because it is more constant even if it heals less than the occulist but everybody told to me naah dont take the vestal just take the occulist then what is the point of the game if its just to play like hearthstone and brainlesly taking others people decks wheres the fun part,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon is a 2d rpg dungeon crawler with a grim premise promising hardship and challenge to anyone who enters the good fantastic artstyle narrator and music the atmosphere of darkest dungeon is simply amazing the characters the player can recruit are all different and have fun quips and personalities addictive dungeon crawling that will make you go for just one more quest the ui is elegant and superbly done the devs have added options to removetoggle corpses nerf enemy crits and more small tweaks certain heroes now bring items with them when embarking for example the crusader will bring holy water the bad the difficulty isnt a curve but a wall a wall that has been known to be hit even in the tutorial the game wants to be hard and thats a fine selling point however this is not elegant design like dark souls but rather by arbitrarily stacking the odds against you you have to juggle gold experience points and resources for buildings in order to progress which is fine in theory but gold will quickly become the least of your worries as you grind away at resources and while doing that you have to avoid overleveling heroes as this makes it impossible for them to participate in missions they will then deem to easy yes you read that right your heroes will actually go against your orders with a huge variety in heroes imbalance is sure to arise but the issue is how obvious it is for example the plague doctor has been one of the weakest hero types throughout this entire early access and they still are because they simply cant match the healing of the vestal or the damage of the arbalist most trinkets are useless almost all of them come with one or two bonuses but also one or two negatives a select few artifacts only have bonuses but they usually arent too great and they are hard to find the quirk system is currently stacked against the player just like everything else negative quirks can fester and become extremely expensive to get rid off positive quirks dont have this option so sometimes after leveling youll lose valuable quirks because your hero leveled up furthermore diseases are now their own seperate thing but they dont disappear over time and have to be removed as well once again its just tedium for tediums sake because now you have to spend even longer on grinding them away too red hook has so far with every update and without fail nerfed heroes and strategies into oblivion which is fine afterall the game should be balanced however they have crossed the line where it has now become mandatory to use a walkthrough on how to minmax gone are the days where 4 jesters could enter a dungeon and while they wouldnt be a great team they could pull through after nearly 50 hours it has become clear to me that one of the biggest issues is the pacing upgrading your town takes way too many resources and you never gain the ability to hire heroes higher than level 0 you never truly lose youre just doing the same thing over and over always making the same heroes and dismissing them after they become too expensive to make viable bottom line darkest dungeon has so much potential and back when i first bought it i was absolutely hooked by the atmosphere and surface gameply but once you get deeper you realize just how poor the execution truly is one misstep feels like it can ruin your entire game forcing you to start over the game still has immense potential but the goal of making a hard game has grown and taken over the core design and its killing the experience i vehemently hope that i can change this to a recommendation once the next promised update hits,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,want to play a game where you can play as safe and as optimally as possible and still get taken out by the rng that seems to be tipped against you boy have i got a treat for you if the enemies get a few lucky rolls they can take out a characters entire healthbar before youre given the chance to intervene flushing several hours worth of progress not to mention a lot of luck down the drain on the flipside you can play like absolute garbage and have nobody in your party die ever because whether or not a character lives or dies when theyre at 0hp is purely down to chance i get that the design is supposed to force the player to make the best of a bad situation and i can get behind that but at this stage as of today this stage is the game as the devs invisioned it on release theres no hope for change there are too many design decisions that force the outcome out of the players hands this is probably because the part of the game that is actually up to the player is so easy if youve got at least a few braincells rubbing together it doesnt take long to figure out how to play it optimally so rather than address that the developers have decided to make it randomly kick you in the nuts every few minutes this doesnt make it deep or challenging just frustrating the golden moments where the game achieves what it sets out to do with its chaos management mechanics are few and far between and most rng punishment tends to go around instantly eliminating one of your heroes rather than requiring you to adapt your strategy because of the loss of a character youre able to just go back to a level 1 dungeon and start over because all it takes to replace a dead hero is to grind a few levels it doesnt add any extra challenge it just forces you to grind more it fits into the newwave hardcore trend following dark souls where being hardcore comes more from marketing and player perspective than actually being a difficult game and as a result thats the philosophy that drives the worst elements of its design whats more players who picked up the game based on this marketing are willing to defend these elements to the death because if the public perception were to change to see the mechanics the way they are without the omg so hardcore veneer that would invalidate the hardcore gamer cred they feel theyve earned by suffering through the games grind if youre feeling called out at this point thats great because i think youre a tool art storytelling and atmosphere are a and im going to come back to it just for that when the last of the content is added but the game itself is a grind facilitated by rng that shouldnt pose any actual challenge to anyone with a reasonable knowledge of crpg mechanics i rate this game 25 out of 5 loaded dice,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon is a beautiful atmospheric and well put together game let down by mistaking randomness for difficulty,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i would compare this game to a long book that you might really enjoy at first but then by the end youre kind of annoyed at how it drags on its just way too long for how little contentprogression there is its honestly so long that the rare occasion i see story content i dont even remember what id been told in the past also when a game is this unforgiving youll usually crest over a point where your gearcharacters starts synergizing really well and that satisfactory dominance makes the strugle all worth it this game never gives you that it just gets harder and harder and youll lose your best guys and items to some rng and have to start a whole group of fresh characters all over again the styling and gameplay is cool but i cant reccomend this game to anynoe knowing how much drudgery it ends up being if you do decide to play it make sure you reference the wiki on every single curioboss fight trying to play without it by trial and error will extend the game by probably 30 hours,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,one of the greatest defeats snatched from the jaws of victory a tragedy in many parts,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,embrace the character deaths accept the newbie salt and youll have a great time absolutely amazing and addictive rpg dungeon crawl game play and art are top notch highly recommended,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,theres no way to give this game a fair review anymore the fanbase for darkest dungeon is split so far down the middle that we have two completely extreme views people praising and loving the game and disregarding any and all faults then theres the other side with people saying that the game is an utter time waster with no fun a slew of bugs and all sorts of other complaints im sure what i have to say at this point will matter to no one but ill do my best review it based on my own thoughts rather than the opinions i have read elsewhere online but i will delve into those later im not the smartest guy ill be up front about that i rarely go into games and know exactly what things that can be exploited what must be done to make this or that easy find loopholes or redundencies i dont have the patience to go through each and every stat effect and percentage and chart it all out its just not something i have interest in or time to do with this in mind you can probably tell that i dont actually look into the rng all that much critical hits are critical hits misses are misses i never noticed if one side had an advantage over the other i never noticed the effects that torches had on the battlefield cuz i always had one lit i never noticed if one side got more buffs or had resistances or any of that i just played the game how i thought it should be played here is where my biggest issue with the entirety of the game comes into play the inability to play how you want now i get it darkest dungeon is meant to be difficult its meant to put you into a corner but its boot to your jaw and see how you can escape it heres a few things i dont like however about said difficulty with personal examples from the game battle mechanics on a defensive side what do i mean by this well once i was playing through a dungeon i had a tough time with a wave and wanted to go on the defensive for a bit get some health back real quick before i proceeded to the next battle so i kept an enemy in stunlockdebuff while i used my healer to get my fighters back into a better spot with this one enemy left completely weak and vulnerable it seemed like a viable strategy in order to get my footing back and continue strong but nope literally two turns after trying this strategy two enemies randomly come out of the woodwork because this game has to be so hard that it just throws more t at you what this said to me was this no player you do not play how you want to play you cannot use the strategies you want to use you play by our rules you go fast and kill fast and if your players die in the process well too bad some players may see this as just another part of the challenge but i see this as a fundamental flaw you are not allowed to play this game how you see fit you are not allowed to go on the defensive take advantage of a situation and play to your strenghts you can only play how the devs want you to play and that to me isnt fun it is frustrating its tedious and it lead to me shutting off the game and not playing it ever again escaping battle this is a shorter one but still a grievance with the game i personally have so when you escape battle you are given a consequence of stress i saw this as a fair trade if things are going badly you have the choice to take the stress in order to fight another day this brilliant idea was ruined by the timeworn bs cliche of not being able to escape so not only do i have to accept the consequence of a massive stress boost when i actually manage to get out of battle i have to risk my party members in an entire turn that could possibly get any of them killed if the escape attempt fails that is not ok take one punishment dont put them all in one basket and dont give me the git gud crap everyone else does we all enter bad situations in this game that we need to escape once in a while rng makes it so dont corner the player by making them worry if theyll escape or not and if you want to keep that fine but get rid of the added stress issue then pick one poison and stick to it the stress meter now i have to say this was actually one of the reasons i was fascinated with this game at first it seemed like such a neat mechanic that could actually end up with good results and not bad out of the countless times my characters reached full stress only twice has something heroic happened this should be a 5050 chance and not a 1090 imo youre already threatening death with the stress waves which apparently wasnt in the original ea version why make it even more challenging by not giving the player a fair shot at feeling amazing because youre too busy making it feel frustratingly difficult thats why eh now with all that said youd think i hate this game im just another one of those jerks on the internet saying its the worst thing ever but heres the thing i dont with all that said i still love so much about the game the art style so refreshingly simple yet bold and interesting the music tense adds to the atmosphere and well composed the designs goes hand in hand with art style in a way but every class looks very unique and stands out in their own way the voice acting top ing notch hard not to love complex dialogue makes this game feel intelligent even if the narrator isnt saying anything most of the time other than this sucks sometimes yo fascinating game mechanics like stress and perksnegatives while some people abbhore some of these things i am impressed with how many different things your characters can get both positive and negative there are things to love about this game there are things to hate about this game i am left torn down the middle i want to like this game i want to get swept up inside of it lose myself for hours on end from dungeon to dungeon butevery time a risky dungeon is presented i dont want to take it because i fear i have to start from scratch from a different warrior the fact that people think that the death of your character is a fair punishment just isnt true all those hours and money into these particular characters you want to crusade through dungeons with are put out within minutes due to bad rng bad situations or just bad planning or poor decision making and even if it was all my fault even if it was misdirection or poor planning or player error orwhatever even with all that in mind and the fact that my characters died wasting hours of my life because of simple mistakes is that ok does it make it a fun challenge or a slog the answer is that there is no answer this game is dependent on what you like as a gamer and as a person really youre not a bad person for liking this game and youre not bad for disliking it i see the points of people on both sides and i think everyone should just calm the down and learn to deal with other peoples opinions on the internet although that probably wont ever happen even though it should as for methis game is interesting its stressful its tactful its challenging but in spite of things it just isnt fun to me a lot of times it felt like a chore to the point where i no longer wanted to play take that for what its worth,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,updated for final release i got this back in june during early access and the journey has had a lot of ups and downs this might in part be my fault since i got involved during this stage most people get when facebook changes its layout you can only imagine how rustled id get when id get on and find the gameplay mechanics of dd would change but i can accept those twists and turns as part of the development process with that said and believe me ive dumped 100 hours into this game so i say this with a heavy heart im pretty dissapointed with where they took this during that time of development darkest dungeon doesnt have any obvious one glaring flaw but small things add up and its the small things the devs take that do the most damage now obviously this is supposed to be a harsh and adverse game the whole point is to be difficult and unforgiving after all right well yes you would be right the game itself proclaims that is about making the most of a bad situation how there will be deaths there will be failure and so on it warns you right out of the starting gate hell thats part of the reason i got into this game i liked the idea of a dungeon crawler with long lasting wear and tear on adventuring your heroes getting quirks for better and for worse diseases weird obsessions thats all pretty damn cool and it helps make the game what it is but the problems come from the small things that add up i dont think dds problems come from any of its core ideas but the ways theyre implemented you want the game to be difficult unforgiving even but you still want it to be fun challenging and most importantly rewarding pros the art is fantastic absolutely terrific and it never gets tiring to look at the soundtrack is great im not even sure how to label it but imagine a mix of horror grunge and epic orchestra the games narrator played by wayne june who has done countless audiobook readings of hp lovecrafts works is perfect in every way for the role and just oozes a brooding edge the core gameplay is simple intuitive and the team manages to build a lot of complexity and synergy out of the turn based combat cons 1 the game has gotten progressively more bent on grinding there are 5 areas in the game each area has two bosses you must fight each of those bosses three times each of these bosses is at a different level ranking higher level heroes cannot play lower level dungeons if you do not plan out managing three or 4 teams of different ranking hereos far in advance of this you are going to tack on days of extra gameplay just trying to cultivate competent teams to fight bosses youve already battled several times this doesnt even take possible total party kills into account it also doesnt take into account the time you need to kill waiting for heroes to recover from stress disease crippling quirks or just straight up wandering off this isnt difficult challenging or rewarding it is tedious it can be infuriating but not as infuriating as 2 not getting any sort of reward or compensation for slugging through said grind im not asking for a pat on the head and a slice of birthday cake pushed into my mouth for not quitting 30 seconds into the game however most games especially the grindy ones usually give you something in return for putting all that time in your level 6 legendary heroes have fought their way up the blood soaked ladder having disposed of countless monstrosities and grappled with their personal demons time and time again theyre scarred theyre battered theyre hard boiled sons of es that live to claw the eyes out of mutant fish monsters youve given them the best armor the best trinkets and pair them up in groups where they synergize the best they drop like flies in the darkest dungeon area theres no weight no reward for dragging your guys through the mud until theyre legendary theyre just as likely to spazz out and panic as they were at level 0 they can barely cut through high protection level enemies and the same cultists jerks youve been slapping around since week 1 can now give them heart attacks in 4 turns if you dont take them out immediately because now they get arbitrarily huge stat numbers for the final dungeon speaking of arbitrary numbers 3 the hardest parts of the game are mechanics outside of the combat and exploration that the devs use to punish the player a game like this ought to punish you for making stupid mistakes a game like this should throw lasting repurcussions at you for failure games like xcom do this really well because said repurcussions feel like natural cause and effect for the situation dd does not do this and it feels more malicious than anything it doesnt tell you the rules it wants you to play by and when you step out of line itll take your hand off for it especially if it catches you trying to heal your party up when only a single enemy is left it used to be content just to make your party get stressed but now it throws a new mob of enemies at you and thats really the big problem with a game as challenging as this the struggle alone should be enough but the game will actively punish you for struggling these are the problems with darkest dungeon corpses and heart attacks are annoying when the game first surprised you with them during early access but with adjustment they fit right in and mesh with the tone the difficulty and open up new lanes of strategy those arent the problems those are challenges darkest dungeon is not a bad game on the contrary i think theres an excellent game in here but its buried under the weight of a lot of busywork and excessive punishment it doles out at you for not doing what it wants but doesnt tell you to it takes and it takes but it never gives back darkest dungeon is a game of diminishing returns im not saying you should avoid it but heed my warning youll love darkest dungeon but no matter how much time and work you give to it it wont love you back kinda like an ex really,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,tldr i dont feel rewarded for the effort that i put into the game i am disappointed to say the least so after beating the game i stand by my points since early access the game just isnt rewarding to play with how much grind and garbage you gotta slog through to reach the end and then it hardly feels like you are overcoming a great evil so much as it feels like you just have to exploit t to pass i dont feel like i was truly challenged just constantly had someone trying to cheat me i genuinely feel like all the positive ratings for the game are a result of the git gud crowd who themselves probably suck a challenge to overcome is what i live for darkest dungeon was less a challenge and more a gamble honestly i was hoping the ending dungeons and ending itself would be rewarding but instead i feel pretty empty i guess thats the way you feel when you are so mad at a game you are just trying to find something good in it and you just dont darkest dungeon is playing a poker game and going all in you play your hand clench your teeth andor buttcheeks and then you win and get a load of money after getting home you realize that you spent a crap load of money on cheetos and soda and also you need to spend some money on releiving stress from the ordeal for some reason and end up with just enough money in the positives to buy a soda and enough money left over to do it all again not very satisfying as of july 15th ive pretty much given up on the game theres no point in trying to help anymore i dont really care that all my saves were deleted i dont really care that they nerfed the crap outta camping buffs i dont care heavily that crusader protection is useless im not crying after they ruined any reason to play in the dark i dont fully care that enemies hit extra hard and do extra stress i dont really find it awful that being marked is considered a means of protection im not upset that my highwayman was killed in the tutorial im not offended that when the game crashes some buffsdebuffs are gone from characters it doesnt bother me that you can just alt f4 when one of your guys gets deathblowed to avoid it im not sad that the game gets kinda monotonous after a bit and i can let the fact they ignore teaching boss mechanics slide but the fact you can lose a party member from 100 to 0 just by encountering spiders in the first mission and its been this way since i started playing no screw this game in the end what really matters is your own opinion the thing is that in my opinion i was not satisfied with the end results of the game,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,idk what people are complaining about its dark and gritty its hard af not ridiculous but definitely challenging to the same degree as dark souls its compelling with a great atmosphere its innovative with mechanics and lasting effects its got an awesome art style its got a traditional turnbased combat with some nice twists you will have to restart and learn from your previous mistakes several times probably you need to think and plan longterm right from the start you will make calculated losses if you think youll like it you probably will,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,a mutant pig vomited on my character and gave them tapeworm this made them eat more than their share of food and caused my party to starve at a camp this caused one of them to become so stressed they abused someone else until they had a heart attack i had to send the rest back to town and buy them alcohol women and let one flagellate themself so they felt better i get a bill the next day from the brothel saying the occultist cant come back because of his deviant fetishes i sent him home no chill no dungeons 1110 ruin your life edit actual review i have spent some time reading other reviews of darkest dungeon and heres some real talk addressing the most common complaints 1 rng please yes this game contains rng why not learn to play around that sometimes your leper will be crit from 1000 by a fat man in chainmail your move crusader man if only king arthur 1st of his name biggest of jockstraps defender of the realm and slayer of harems had thought to bring a bandaid to get ol compost the leper off of deaths door then he might have lived oh wait he totally has that skill you just didnt equip it because biggest sword is best sword big rng crits sink happy little adventurers ships so run a very low level heal skill on 34 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen the leper lives and you dont have to go home and tell his ah remaining foot that the rest wont be coming home you do get better at the game you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes ive run 2030 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character to those who say too much rng not even a game proper prior planning prevents urine poor performance 2 trinkets are trash no reward trinkets have upsides and downsides why not combine two trinkets brainexplosion eg 30 heals 20 stress this is terrible ill die of stress says big bubba oh wait whats this a trinket that says 20 stress what if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team thatll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be legendary trinkets are legendary proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful theres no free hand outs use strategy and planning to win dungeons 3 the game is too much of a grind if youre taking forever to finish the game then youre losing too many people the game is easily finishable within 60 hours true end game dungeoning can take a long time because of certain factors which come into effect however at the end game there are catchup mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast procedurally generated roguelike games such as this you are essentially doing one dungeon after another the only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses which have their own surprises i wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with 1 difficult gameplay where consequences are real 2 brothels 3 tentacles,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,what greater satisfaction you need than hitting your opponent right after weakening them with a terrible finishing blow what greater frustration can you suffer than seeing the enemies dogpile on a single hero rendering it useless in a single turn make no mistake this game can be incredibly frustrating at times the difficulty constantly ramps up as you try to keep your heroes health and stress in check enemies poison you and leave you bleeding with ease and a bad turn can easily screw an entire expedition and cost you good men but as soon as you get in rhythm as soon as you understand how to manage your items what characters have the better synergy together how to position them in a fight and how to counter the monstrosities you find in every mission what once seemed unfair becomes just a challenge a hard challenge that you can still loose but when you do you learn to just arm another party and send them to prevail where the others failed the game makes its own the despair and hopelessness of the lovecraft mythos both in aesthetic and theming while adding a splash of cinical and dark sense of humor you are not here to become an immortal unstoppable force of nature you are here to try and survive an onslaught of horror way beyond what men can really handle and the game will make sure you feel that in every corner just as the men you send to fight and leave the dungeons more and more psychologically crippled every time they go out but so what we are all doomed anyway right if you like turnbased rpgs roguelike games or just challenging experiences this one is worth a shot,1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,ive played over 60 hours of this game and as much as i would love to give this a great review i just cant do it this game can truly be one of the greatsgreat voice acting great visual artwork great story great dungeon crawling experience theres just one thing this game is lackingthe very essence of gaming that all rpgers especially cherishsome type of god damn reward system for spending hours and hours playing the game this game has amazing potential but the reward for playing and progressing through the game are almost nonexistent all of the equipable items are almost worthless even the legendary items are pretty much worthless i mean how do you create a game where the most powerful items have so many drawbacks for equiping them that you might as well just dungeon crawl naked also one more thing this game is so rng heavy that bad luck alone can wipe your whole party and set you back on hours of gameplay its just complete randomness and chaos not even realisticly random more like oppressive sadistic everythingisagainstyou random where you have no control of anything because the combat system is rediculously imbalanced and the tide of battle can shift at any given time no matter how good a player you are the hours of frustration playing this game outweigh the good times which is unfortunate these developers need to wake up and make some adjustments dont buy this game unless you want to pull your hair out,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i wanted to give this game a stellar recommendation but given what this game has become i cannot do so in good conscience when i first bought this game back when it was in early access it was something really interesting an incredible aesthetic matched by a gameplay that married the best aspects of rpgs and dungeon crawlers with its own twists and turns that made for a wholly engrossing experience it wasnt perfect but it was challenging enjoyable and most importantly of all rewarding all the way through the development process id periodically start up a new run to see what sort of changes had been made and for the most part i wasnt disappointed the difficult of the game got ramped up but so too did the classes themselves the fights were both terrifying and exhilarating and taking down a boss felt like a triumphant moment the new classes were interesting and the quirks system made them feel like more than just a grouping of mechanics i didnt mind the introduction of heart attacks and corpses as they forced me to keep a closer eye on my stress levels and put more thought into my party lineups as darkest dungeon reached its final stage the very same elements that made it so fun and enjoyable for me have become twisted into something that has turned the game into the exact opposite reaching resolve level 5 and 6 used to be an accomplishment a marker that these charactersheroes had faced overwhelming odds and achieved a greater state of being you would face off against some truly powerful and terrifying enemies but your characters were on par with that power and could exchange blow for blow there was a balance and even when the tide of battle turned against you there was still a chance that you could pull off a victory from the jaws of defeat now the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you dont even think about going into a higher level dungeon with even one of your characters not fully upgraded as they will die at first i thought the sudden skyrocketing of my casualty rates were the result of me making a tactical error but when i looked at play throughs online i found that people who were more or less equally skilled as i was were suffering from similar casualty rates for similar reasons i dont mind losing someone because of an error that i made but losing it because the rng decided they gonna die now is strikes me as something that is blatantly unfair especially when in order to bring them up to the point where they can survive the upper level dungeons requires hours of joyless grinding for resolve and gold and the fruits of those labors dont seem to have an impact on their overall survivability in general darkest dungeon does an extremely poor job of explaining the way different features work or what to expect when going into a new location or facing off against a new type of boss which i dont necessarily mind persay but when the cost of failure are so high that they will undermine hours of work then that becomes a problem and dont even get me started on the final dungeon there are so many design decisions like rendering your characters illegible for future expeditions to name one that are some high grade cow manure and exemplarly of just how unfun the game has become i guess im more disappointed than anything else there are so many aspects of this game that i love and that im sure other players who are thinking about buying this game will love too the aesthetic of this game is absolutely phenomenal the writing is superb the gameplay is innovative and there are some genuinely great features but somewhere along the line the game has become less about facing off against the eldritch horrors and pulling victory from the jaws of defeat and more about not losing horribly it has gone from tough but fair to grueling and frustrating edit for those of you who are interested i effectively did three runs of the game the first i started back in march which went on for roughly 30 hours in which time id completed all the available content i did a second much shorter one in mid july that lasted about 20 hours in which i only got about half way through bosses i started a third one intended to be my final run of the game in late october which took me 45 hours to reach about threequarters of the way to the end game this should help show just how much of a grind this game has become,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,just when i thought i was finished with gaming this gem comes out in a gaming universe now littered with embarrassingly amateurish shovelware insipid aaa titles that usually amount to little more than more of the same with minor tweaks but with eyebleeding superrealistic graphics that require megagpus to get 25 fps another sad trend as of late and just plain scams where devs promise one thing deliver another and disappear into the ether with your cash a game like darkest dungeon dd gives me hope that my once favorite hobby has some life in it yet what is amazing is that dd treads a wellworn road at its heart dd is just another roguelike dungeon crawler but what elevates dd to its own lofty pedestal is a simple question would professional dungeon crawlers develop ptsd at first you laugh at the idea but then you stop and think about it given how your typical fantasy dungeon crawl not only involves the type of brutal combat that any modern soldier would understand but also a host of horrors such as demons giant spiders and other abominations on top of that the answer would seem to be oh heck yeah i guess they really would that is the heart of darkest dungeon darkest dungeon puts the player not just in charge of clearing dungeons but also of managing the mental health of their assailed heroes in dd the player must send teams of four adventurers whom come from a nicely varied assortment of classes to clear dungeons from around half a dozen thematic designs ruins warrens etc this part of the game is great fun resembling a sidescroller your adventurers whom are brought to life with some wonderfully hand drawn artistry reminiscient of a brothers grimm fairytale clear out a series of rooms and passages randomly generated and populated with monsters traps and loot of course in a dungeon of various sizes some so big that your team will need to camp inside a few times such moments are a lot of fun as it involves its own unique gameplay of recuperation and campsite chatter battle is handled in a wonderful turnbased fashion love it so glad to see devs getting away from clickfest rts games with both sides using their weapons and skills to strike each other down something wonderfully enhanced by a narrator who comments on the action with a voice right out of yes a grimms fairytale but here is the important kicker as your adventurers explore and battle their way through a dungeon the game tracks stress points individually so for example if your manatarms suffers a critical hit at the hand of a foe his stress level will go up as might the stress of the other party members on the other hand if he deals a devastating riposte his stress might go down and so on if stress accumulates to a certain degree the adventurer might have a mental break it is here that the game begins to resemble crusader kings 2 in that each adventurer can accumulate a mix of up to a dozen vices and virtues that will affect their performance so that manatarms who was almost killed might become a coward when he has his mental break something that might debuff his stats or make him miss a turn or maybe he overcomes his fear and gets a virtue instead he becomes heroic and urges his party to fight harder reducing stress for all and buffing combat stats see how it works it is quite fun and adds a wonderful novelty to the game but be warned if your adventurer becomes too stressed he can actually die of a heartattack speaking of heartattacks that is what might happen to the gamer when he loses one of his star adventurers to permadeath yeah this game has that personally i love permadeath because nothing ruins a tale of adventuring heroism when the player can just save and restore face it sampr is just immortality by another name how can there be true heroism if the hero is never truly at risk but that is just my two cents be that as it may this game has permadeath so be prepared to lose some of your best players to the evil machninations of the random number generator that governs many aspects of this game if you hate such mechanics than this game is not for you what happens when your adventurers leave a dungeon assuming they survive here the game takes on an xcomlike factor where base management comes into play in between dungeon crawls the player can send his adventurers out with bags of gold to help them blow off steam in six different ways from getting drunk to praying at the abbey of course this takes these adventurers out of the game for at least a week i say at least a week becayse random events occasionally trigger where say your knight gets drunk and wanders the town for two weeks in a state of inebriation lol that actually happened to one of my adventurers not only did he go awol for an extra week be he lost the magic trinket i gave him hence the player needs to have a deep bench of adventurers to keep the gaming moving along something that is not initially difficult as the local stage coach brings in a steady supply of new victier adventurers in addition to managing the stress of your bench you can also train new skills upgrade armor and weapons upgrade facilities treat the mental and physical ailments your adventurers acquire in the darkest dungeons and select the next adventure and get kitted out for it and that is pretty much the basics of the game in a nutshell again with the exception of the stress factor nothing revolutionary but redhook with feedback from the community this is ea done right applied so much thoughtfulness attention to detail and ol fashioned love to their project that what has emerged out the other end may well be game of the year material for the pc frankly it has been a very long time since i have so thoroughly enjoyed a game with the devs already promising a new class of adventurer as well as town events in the near future gratis the town does need some enlivening as it feels a little static and dull at times so i am glad to hear this i think the darkest dungeon has a very bright future ahead of it it certainly has already rocketed to the top of my favorite games list,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,there can be no hope in this hell no hope at all the ancestor now that the game is released and i have played it in the finished state i can say that i am quite disappointed sure the difficulty is fine and entertaining but only for so long all hero upgrades feel absolutely underwhelming now this might not be obvious at the start because properly upgraded and geared heroes can easily chew through any easy and medium dungeons but then come the lvl 5 champion ones and with them comes utter disaster as monsters start to show up with abominable amounts of protwhile we still have only two heroes who can counter this spd and additional effects to their attacks at this point your tactics and overall preparedness barely matter as everything is purely in the hands of the game the dice will decide your fate and in the final stages they are loaded against you pros stunning and hauntingly beautiful art music and atmosphere one superb amazing narrator cons insane difficulty spike near game end without any reasonable means to offset it tactics will only get you so far heroes actually start to feel weak as the game progresses without a crit youre very likely to end in the gutter i really dont want to complain but i simply fail to justify the reason why some filthy pigs skeletons bandits and mushroom abominations all have prot while my lvl 5 armour even on crusader and manatarms who actually wear plate provides none of it it feels terribly grindy the amount of various relics required especially deeds is atrocious the amount of gold necessary for upgrades and the quality of upgrades themselves is disgusting the game actually encourages you to sacrifice your first best group of heroes as they will accumulate exp faster than gear and at some point will not be able to handle the dungeons appropriate for them,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,great game it easily became one of my most favorite games it has all the elements i love in video games turn based strategy rpg dark gothic style team and town management random loot medieval time no fairy tale magic random generated levels perma death and customization of characters i love this game so much that i created my fan made comic book please check them out httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid386523966 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid515275078 httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid428958000,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,its a tough game to review now thats it out of early access ideally id give it a neutral recommendation but since i cant its going to be not recommended why the game evolved very little since ea started they added more stuff heroes enemies sure but they didnt really add more depth or refine the game mechanics in any meaningful way the grind and this is coming from someone who can take a lot of grind in games this is the worst kind of grind the grind without any meaningful progress in sight most of the game youll be doing the same medium length missions over and over again to grind gold deeds and xp in fact you have to beat every mission a number of times before a boss fight unlocks then each boss has to be killed 3 times after you fill the grind bar 3 times obviously much like your heroes the bosses dont get any new skills they just get stat buffs then you beat the final dungeon thats it if you cut all the fat the game could be beaten in 2030 missions without repeating the same scouting quest 20 times and spending 526 deeds to improve the bar in your village in fact it wouldve been better that way incredibly shallow game mechanics stress it was promised to be a core mechanics of the game and its just another healthbar with random effects at break points afflictions way too easy to remove hero skills just bigger numbers from start to finish equipment again bigger numbers zero variety trinkets take the ones that improve the stat you want sell the rest exploration doesnt exist combat tactics shoot the eldritch horror until it dies difficulty the game seems very difficult at first but its an illusion once you learn to game the system and proper party composition it gets trivial youll still lose a hero or be forced to abandon a mission every now and then the game is rng heavy but because the game has no failstate youre only limited by how much grind you can take now thats it out of ea i can say that some things seem like placeholders the hunger mechanic is a joke dungeons are mapped from the start torchlight system is just tedium many skills and trinket are complete garbage and essentially serve as a newbie trap corpses dont add to the difficulty or tactics they just prolong fights and look stupid i could go on but these are nitpicks that wouldnt matter if the core gameplay had more depth to it whats good about it the atmosphere graphics and narration are excellent gameplay not so much its not completely terrible but they underdelivered concentrating on meaningless fluff like corpses heart attacks and fight prolonging penalties instead of adding some choice and depth to gameplay its a 510 game if you get it for 10 or less you might have fun for your money but thats all it is a shame really,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,darkest dungeon in the first 20hrs of playis exactly the same as darkest dungeon in the 100th hour of play there is enough class complexity and tactical depth for to be very engaging early but this just doesnt last had i quit after the first 20hrs i would have been left with a strongly positive impression unfortunately as a completionist i wanted to see the game finished and thats when i found myself bogged down in an grind of repetitive encounters and contrived hurdles that function only to lengthen not enhance the core campaign while the class depth and balance is very good it is a shame that the combat system is so limited and unimaginative this is a game that i played almost in its entirety with the sound off while watching movies and documentaries,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this game starts out being difficult in a really fair and interesting way but that thread runs out harsh but meaningful progression gives way to what you try to tell yourself is not tedium but which absolutely is if youre the type of person who will only play the first few hours of something regardless go ahead and get this its a ton of fun initially and the production quality is outstanding but if you get it into your head that you actually want to finish this thing darkest dungeon is a huge disappointment,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i love this game ive nearly beaten it it has been very fun but i cant recommend it in its current state it has obviously had a lot of work put into it but it still needs a lot of work my main complaint is that for a game that was created with the idea in mind of introducing the player to a world of realismwith fantacy lovecraftian eldritch horror themes of the human mind and body being put to the test and the results of doing so for some reason they decided the way to do this was with rng deciding the mechanics they so heavily wanted to emphasize permadeath and afflictions pros very well done visually sound effects narration and music are great strategy based gameplay with many party and skill combinations to use difficult in a satisfying way usually cons too heavily dependant on rng mechanics that are the main focus of the game such as permanent death deathblow at deaths door and how heroes react to stressafflictionvirtue are entirely up to chance im fine with rng when its used to create the quests but the combat and progress in general is too heavily dependant on it to add on to this the game actually becomes more rng dependant as you progress critical hits become more common and effects decided by rng bleed blight disease debuffs move become more common a total grindfest seriously it takes so long to raise heroes to be able to have any chance at surviving the lvl 6 darkest dungeon missions heroes come with and gain throughout their quest through rng various negative quirks that render them useless against the extremely unforgiving stress and health damage of the late game enemies so you have to grind low level dark runs to gain enough gold to afford the treatments to cure their quirks to make your higher level heroes even usable,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,snapshot a lovecraftian game built to mirror the stress and sanity loss between the player and the characters in the game overall 6 10 pros great atmosphere aesthetics satisfying meta progression cons huge emphasis on very poor rng game is balanced heavily against the player early on gameplay gets repetitive quickly details im going to say this up front i save scummed the out of this game and i dont feel one iota of remorse overall the game has a lot of fun elements to it but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices mostly those that were added postalpha prealpha the game was a lot of fun often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it postalpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up the game is built to be challenging but what darkest dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions the more you play the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of rng you have to rely on darkest dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck which only gets worse the longer you play the game is built to put the pcs into a dying state quickly and often which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic introduced sometime after alpha and a longstanding point of contention heart attacks cause a pc to instantly enter a dying state regardless of health or die permanently if they are already dying because of this often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party regardless of how well you are doing sanity loss for pcs leads to afflictions which basically makes the given pc suicidal for the rest of the dungeon more often than not an afflicted pc will skip their turn refuse healing shift the party order around or somehow injure or debuff themselves it would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen but instead they often happen in succession which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction and the cycle repeats this quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75 of your turns are either skipped or used to rearrange heroes because they cant do anything else not even defend this is in short not fun whatsoever aside from the indungeon frustrations the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon with pcs claiming that they wouldnt learn anything from the experience or some other ridiculous reasoning this is actually probably my biggest gripe even moreso than heart attacks this level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon unfortunately it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again reliving the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome overall i do like darkest dungeon when the dice are in my favor when they arent which is 75 of the time it seems the game is just an unending stream of frustration the thrill charm and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in prealpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the postlaunch changes and given that i play games to relieve stress and have fun this is the opposite of the desired result as such i cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,a lot of this games atmosphere will suck you in but the tragic truth is that this is a game of luck there are far too many instances where the rng comes into play and they all involve your party being killed the thing is none of those elements can be fixed with a patch the stress levels of your heroes will not be able to recover within a reasonable amount of time the healing techniques are sparse and can be randomly refused by your heroes the roguelike gameplay means that you may spend a half hour sprawling through a dungeon getting lower on supplies until you happen upon the objective by luck this game may be fun for some but the tragedy is that most of the problems with this game are because of incompetent design to criticize the amount of luck involved with the game is to risk being told to git gud,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,genre roguelike gothic fantasy i waited until the full release to post a review as there were a few key things missing from early access like achievements now after playing the game some more i can safely recommend it although it is roguelike it plays as a side scrolling dungeon crawler with parties of four you are situated in a village allowing for weapon and skill upgrades as well as the recruiting of new adventurers expect some to die along the way there are quite varied classes although maybe another tyoe of party healer is required as there are only two classes that do this role effectively as you complete each dungeon you get heirlooms these can then be used to upgrade your village amenites you can choose out of a few areas at once with bosses along the way to fight meaning you wont get stuck in just one area with the smae baddies for ages the combat can be challenging but not impossible as far as i know i am still near the start what makes this game stand out is the stress effect on your characters as you explore each dungeon some are positive but most are negative for instance they might become abusive to other adventurers increasing their stress or paranoid and avoid being healed etc to help with this you use the tavern or the abbey to calm them down meaning you will constantly be rotating your party for each mission there are also disease effects to account for and sometimes personal preference like being god fearing etc the art style itself is fairly unique and very atmospheric and the voice acting of the plot driver is fantastic it is a fun game that pushes the boundaries of the genre and can be played in short doses with persistent progression to your village and characters if they survive that is,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,its very easy to get involved into the dark hopeless and grim atmosphere this game manages to create thanks to the excellent art with a very wellfitting choice of colours and to the immersive musics and fx i never opened the settings menu to enable or disable game mechanics because i think this game should be experimented in an artistic and sensorial way not in a rational one criticizing mechanics and so on this game is about the fragile human psyche and the illusion of faith and earthly pleasures used as a placebo in a desperate attempt to avoid its fracture strategy is nothing when fate itself is against you and this is represented by a lot of game statistics being expressed by percentages human skill is useless against timeless horrors one can only hope to succeed out of a burst of good luck this game is capable of keeping constantly high my level of anxiety during missions with even victory resulting in a somewhat negative situation followed by all the mental and physical consequences the heroes must face and my level of discouragement while managing the hamlet with all the heroes getting sick mad asking not to be sent again down there maybe i like this game because it sees life as i do im quite pessimist thus i think that chances are always against me hope is just a childish feeling to me but im not completely hopeless im stubborn and tend to recover from setbacks out of pride but im prone to frustration too so i greatly dislike unfair games like darkest dungeon can be quite often i could not get frustrated by it till now though like i could easily get by a bad serie of aseptic dice rolls for example in fact in darkest dungeon things go terribly wrong in such a dramatic end elegant way that all i can think about is only the epicness of my defeat with the music that becomes more and more pressing and anxiogenic as the hope of victory fades away i admit it sometimes i ragequit sometimes i facepalmed some other times i watched the screen in disappoint and disbelief as if i really was in that dungeon with those poor souls called heroes by some townsfolk and surrendered like them to some nasty mental derangement for just a second this game awakened in me again the fear of bosses because theyre overpowered and there is permadeath characters are designed to be antiheroes and this concept reaches its apotheosis when a pious paladin succumbs to his inner selfishness and show himself as the frail human he actually is and what should that paladin think when a distrusted abomination reacts to his stress with virtue and valor instead a rare event indeed as you have seen i have not covered any technical aspect in this review because i think that if you look for the gameplay mechanics or strategy aspects in this game well this is not the game for you edit november 2016 voted darkest dungeon for autumn sales awards,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,after more than twenty hours of gameplay i have to come to terms with the fact that this game is not for me which is not the same as saying darkest dungeon is bad it is not a bad game but i guess it targets a player niche im not part of and that is a shame because i loved most things about it the setting the writing the atmosphere the art and plenty of the gameplay mechanics i sincerely wanted to see this one to its end what dissuaded me from doing so was what i consider a serious imbalance between reward and frustration within the game and i dont mind difficult games having played through ftl countless times as well as half the souls series what im not willing to deal with is how easily you can lose characters or even have your party wiped out despite hours of power playing upgrading and strategizing the challenge borders on the unfair but fans of the game seem to revel in that thus i do not count myself among the games target public and yes id been warned that id lose entire parties that my favorite characters would die etc still because every other aspect of the game enticed me i gave it a try and now i can say without prejudice and with pain in my heart that the mandatory grind of darkest dungeon is not worth the time and aggravation it would take to beat the game cest la vie edit it has been interesting to watch the reaction of darkest dunegon fans to negative reviews most of which come in the form of one or a variation of the following a too hard git gud noob1 my reply its not that hard once you learn how to optimize your parties but that is part of the problem in order to have a chance you need optimization and that leads to a joyless varietyfree grind in spite of all the interesting classes and abilities b only 20 hours cr4p review my reply much like the previous case this translates into waah waah you dislike my favorite game you suck which is both immature and untrue along the same lines youll see people saying this game is easy if you take the time to actually learn it and to these people i say not everyone has or is willing to spend 100 hours to memorize game patterns and not all reviewers should be expected to spend that long on the game before they are allowed to give their opinion please learn to cope with disagreement fact despite all its qualities and there are many this game is grindy as hell and dishes out massive doses of frustration to boot review readers will be interested in learning this and reviews which contain this information are useful crying cr4p review only because of the red thumb down makes you a whiny fanboy c this game is not supposed to make you feel good my reply if this is an honest statement then we play games for very different reasons which is fine granted there are games which inspire a range of emotions both positive and negative in a way that is ultimately rewarding but darkest dungeon is not one of them and anyway i already spend too many hours on one grindy game that gives me more than my fair share of grief and frustration its called life which has a mandatory minigame called work dont judge me for enjoying a little variety,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,the overall package of darkest dungeon is very polished great visual design audio the whole thing but in attempts to promote their game as hardest of the hardcore the devs basically skew their own stats against the player in calculations when at 60 dodge i dodge nothing there is something clearly ed up with the rng numbers i have seen mobs with far lower dodge dance around my guys blows this includes an undead bloated corpse im sorry but no if you want your statbased supertough hardcore game you bloody well make those numbers on my statscreen mean something give me percentages proper percentages dont hide it behind arbitrary numbers show me the chance to hit instead of seperating dodge and miss chance how exactly am i to know you are fair if you deliberately obscure numbers maybe that new update with the new mode would help but they should come out and say it that mode is an actual proper balance patch,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,ill start with a warning if you dislike rng and it making a big difference you might wanna skip this game even with the right tactics some wellgeared characters and a lot of experience some encounters might still get your favorite adventurers killed you should be aware of this and if you hate having some very unhappy rolls on attacks then this might be very frustrating now i at first wasnt very interest in dd but a review and stream by tb made me change my mind and try it and i was captivated quickly the game is a lot of fun the graphics and animations are very simple but also very stylish so they have character and are nice to look at the atmosphere is great there is a certain lovecraftian vibe to things not only because madness can become a real problem for your adventurers and the narrator does such a great job btw check out his readings of hplstories such a cool experience even with a lot of training these dungeons will be risky for your guys bad rng on heals instead of say 8 points you get 0 or 1 points which means you kinda lost a turn or damage sometimes you are that close to killing a mob but then 23 of your guys actually miss and you actually end up losing debuffs like selfishness your character might snag loot for himself or paranoia he or she might actually refuse to be healed etc i did like the darknessmechanic there are advantages and disadvantages to letting the light go dim or using torches to get to 100 light with this mechanic you kinda pick how you wanna approach the dungeon a little bit like controlling the difficulty level yourself not that it is a cakewalk if you spam torches mind you and the increased rewards you get for fights at low light levels come with increased risks too so you may ask why do people play this are we all out for punishment no the game is just very addictive in that come on just one more quick dungeon before i head to bed whoops its 3 am way it is challenging it will often feel unfair but boy winning battles and completing dungeons feels so very satisfying you start to care about your chars and there is an achievement about beating the final boss with the chars you get at the beginning of the game especially if you name them yourself a guide might help you get started as money will be an issue supplies are expensive so you wanna pick carefully what to take along but even if you just dive in and go trial and error you will learn what to do talking about that here is one complaint i have the supplies and treatments imo are too expensive even when you clear out tons of tough dungeons you might have low funds due to the prize of upgrades to your buildings treatments and supplies like bandages and torches sure those supplies shouldnt be so cheap or plentiful that you can spam them at all times but then simply limit the amount you can get more i didnt mind all the bad luck with the rng and losing fights i thought id rather easily win but i found those prizes frustrating and imo they should be lowered at least a tiny bit other than that its a great tactical game some fights will have you bite your nails sometimes you will feel disappointed especially when losing a character you leveled up the game will eventually become kinda grindy but at that point you could just play it casually like doing half an hour or so and then returning later pros atmospheric simple but unique graphics and animations great narrator voice challenging you get to choose your abilityloadout very satisfying when you beat a boss or dungeon cons and very frustrating when they beat you expensive supplies expensive treatment to get rid of debuffs and stuff can get grindy not recommended if you hate losing rng rolls even when your characters are leveled and equipped with good gear can feel a bit repetitive great game watch some playthroughs and maybe a guide and then decide for yourself i thoroughly enjoy the game,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,some good some bad the general gameplay is pretty decent a turnbased dungeon explorer that said theres a lot of elements that are really just frustrating to deal with the stress system while sometimes fun it feels pretty awesome when you hit 100 stress and your character gets a heroic bonus instead of crumbling under the stress like the majority of characters do is more annoying than anything when maximum stress hits the character has a heart attack dropping their health to zero and debuffing them for the remainder of the dungeon which can be a group killing experience to avoid this youre expected to treat the characters stress by leaving them in the local bar or church while you go on your next adventure this leads to a lot of characters leveling up at different rates this wouldnt be too bad but theres invisible barriers between characters of certain levels for instance level 3 characters cant embark with level 2 characters this causes problems where the only characters available on your roster are two level 3s and two level 2s because everyone else is healing from stress or illness except you cant embark with that group because theyre separate level groups so what do you do well you can either take a highly stressed character out of the bar or church because you need some lower leveled guys to adventure with to get some people up to level 3 i realize its supposed to be a matter of how to manage the team but its more frustrating than anything a high stressed character is going to have a heart attack during the dungeon and ruin the run and dismissing them to hire a new recruit is just really annoying then theres the spontaneous difficulty spikes for instance one dungeon suggested for level 1 characters asks you to kill a specific character a boss the boss character all of a sudden is able to knock two characters down to 1 health in one attack and gets multiple attack turns in one round meanwhile all before this i had been playing level 1 dungeons others with boss characters that were nowhere near this difficulty its just ridiculous because theres no reason or expectation of such power in a level 1 dungeon theres also the low drop rates of gold which you need to spend more and more of on supplies just to survive the dungeon but then also need to use to upgrade characters and heal their stress and ailments theres barely enough money to go around which makes advancing characters a pain in the especially when theyll just die to an encounter with an enemy like i mentioned in the last paragraph overall i find the game frustrating but there are redeeming aspects like having a solid team making dungeons a challenging but rewarding experience but like i mentioned with the leveltier separations that can get messed up really quickly id recommend it to people that like repeating tedious elements because you will be losing characters and rerunning the same dungeons to level up new characters again ive read that the game is more of a teammanagement game than a dungeon crawler which kind of rings true the important part of the game seems to be more in how you handle healing characters and the meager funds you get if youre into that aspect and dont care that much about whether your characters survive in the long run then you might like the game i feel the game is misrepresented as a dungeon crawler rpg and thats only a part of the game which is more often frustrating than enjoyable if all you want is to dungeon crawl a different game might be more up your ally if you want to manage your team of weaklings and can accept that most of them are going to die then you might like the game generally i dont recommend the game because i dont think it appeals to a wide audience and most people are going to go into it expecting an experience much different than what it actually is but if you fall within a specific niche of gamers that prefer teammanagement games and grimdark fantasy you might be one of the people that really like darkest dungeon,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,worst balance i ever saw getting your 6 lvl party riped by random boss monster with no way of fighting back baby sit your heroes till level 6 loose them repeat boooring as hell regreting every minute i have spend on this,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,good game horrible balance late game,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this game hates you no matter how much i love it this game always puts me in harsh situations shows me how weak i am and brutally slaughters everyone i like kinda like my ex but thats what makes the game so incredibly good its incredibly dark your enemies are wretched creatures mad undead or the disgusting outcomes of the most horrible experiments since that one time when metallica decided to make an album with lou reedyour heroes are a band of outcasts fight for their own causes have wierd manias and personalities go mad and endanger all that you have been working for there is no save haven when you come back to town with your decimated party your bteam that was recovering from the last quest has turned into a band of ptsdridden wierdos your crusader has run off with a hooker the bandit is hungover the nun has an std and the jester gambled away all your money and then there is also your plague doctor who refuses to leave the local church and the graverobber who has become addicted to more substances than lindsey lohan now pick your four favourite adventurers and watch them die in the dungeon just because one of them got a disease because he thought that halfrotten corpse over there was still edible or because your arbalest went mad and wanted to try his crossbow from the front ranks or because you did not bring enough torches or because you didnt retreat that harsh battle or because you took the wrong turn this game is unforgiving the most trivial mistake or wrong decision can cost you your whole team but thats what makes it still interresting after several weeks strolling through the very repetetive dungeons doing the same old quests every single battle can turn the tide every quest can completely change your strategies roster and motivation i got his game on a sale for 11 and it has been woth every single cent of it tldr atmosphere 910 dark and gritty lovecraftian tone scary monsters wretched heroes heroes have personalities constant threat even outside the dungeon awesome darkcomicstyle excellent narrator who has some overthetop lines since the new update gameplay710 strategy meets rpg permadeath makes every situation intense you can always improve something even after 20 hours there is some new detail to learn stressmechanic is a great innovation unforgiving at times unfair luckbased repetetive i highly recommend this game,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,at first i thought the negative reviews on this game were unfair complaining about the grind or rng it was like these people had never played a roguelike before however after sinking close to 100 hours on this game i sadly have to agree with their sentiments this games atmosphere is excellent its presentation is topnotch the actual gameplay is intuitive yet complex and so of course incredibly fun it really does quite a bit right but the game demands an incredible amount of time and considering the many many different ways it can set you back it feels like a waste rather than an investment a single heros death can set you back hours retreating from a questusually a necessary and reasonable precautionbecomes an infuriating experience after youve spent the last hour and a half trying to chase down an objective that spawned at the very end of a very long map random town events can hinderor even undoyour progress shoot even the mechanics behind completing the eponymous darkest dungeonwhich i will keep relatively unspoiledis geared to extending the already extremely long grind this game takes skill without question many mishaps after embark that appear like the cruel hand of rngesus can actually be traced to smalloften ostensibly innocuouserrors of judgment earlier along the adventure however like any game involving chance sometimes luck isnt on your side and rngesus help you when its not really i feel this is a great game but it is also a game that overstays its welcome in addition to eating all your food spilling chili on your carpet and stealing your last 2000 bill from the wallet you had left on the counter,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,some other reviewers have done a great job highlighting the games quality i may only focus on arguing with the common negative arguments 1 only rng no skill rules and rng are tough and you need to plan carefully and know when to withdraw leave the loot spend much less to fix the characters use the extra left to harden them instead discipline planning analysis are mandatory when approaching late game greed casulaties bankrupt 2 its mostly grind hence dull not untrue but art quality and the plenty variable parameters make things fresh and surprising on most runs i personally hate grindingbased gameplay but this game doesnt feel like that to me 3 i am on windows 10 and it keeps crashing tldr dont be too tough on that one w10 made many older things break please consider in your reviews the game initially targetted windows 78 runs fine on 7 btw and many priorexisting games and software titles are no longer and still not stable on windows 10 as of writing microsoft made some weirdaggressive choices addressing the retrocompatibility with win87 one of those apparently being the user is now a software tester what that really means here is that the devs have to spend extra bucks on working around novelties on w10 rather than making new contents or fixing their own bugs edited style less ranting more tldr,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,a game thats all about luck bad luck that is you can enjoy this game for a hundred hours but inevitably you will face a ciruation where you will have a charecter or an entire party die simply to terrible luck and bad game mechanics and you will throw your hands up in frustration because you will face the terrible grind to recover this is an incredibly fun and beutifully made game everything from the charecters to the evironment is fantastic so think about how terrible the grind must be to invalidate all that save yourself the frustration you will envariably feel and pass on this,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this is a very enjoyable game but it is not worth the asking price not even close the games length is artificial it is very wide but extremely shallow once you get past all the hype and the paid reviews or ignorant reviews like total biscuits review in which he stated things that are not true likely stemming from the fact he barely played the game you find out that this game while very enjoyable has no depth and is poorly designedfrom a gameplay standpoint the art is amazing good sale bait do not pay full price,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,the primary reason for people not recommending this game is because the difficulty got ramped up for release and it now requires actual thinking this is a difficult game and it was advertised as such so people should stop whining and get good if you dont like punishing games then theres no shame in passing on darkest dungeon its a matter of preference but criticising this game for being difficult is like complaining over my little pony having too many ugly ponies its literally the entire ing point of the stupid thing hate it or love it what darkest dungeon intends to do it does really well,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,ill start with the fact that i cant say ive enjoyed this game ive tried i played it and ive played it people might like it because its hard but it is not hard in a fair way its just hard from a rng point of view heres 20 percent chance of you having to grind another 10 hours of the game because the game decided to you over i kinda think that somewhere along the line the developers sat down together and thought oh gee this game is kinda short let us just add all these things so that we make it longer from the fact that you heroes are divas and dont want to go into lower level dungeons to the fact that you can use them once in the endgame its all there people might argue that its in the them of the game yeah sure but theres atmosphere and theres enjoyment this lacks on the latter,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,while i really liked the dark gothic tone of the story its refelection in the mechanics really starts to grate after a while tense battles are all well and good but party wipes just start to become infuriating especially when you lose all your good trinkets i cant even bother to play manipulating the game files to skip leveling characters im that sick of it after one week would dearly like some sort of fast fowardskip animations button to the combat towards the end at the end of the day if im actively feeling down due to a game even if i liked it then i cant reccomend it,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,fantastic art and audio lots of fun until midgame thanks to terrible balance lategame the game very abrubly stops being fun and challenging level 5 dungon enemies kill your carefully crafted heroes immediately and starting over is only fun a few times for me it seems impossible to actually finish this game i havent even gotten to the darkest dungeon maybe ill start once more and just stop when my heroes hit level 5 i wouldve liked to see the ending shame,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,out of the hundreds of games i played for the last 2025 years few games made me feel the thrill and rush of experiencing something new and yet here this game accomplishes the same sensation after all these years but there is a catch you will surely have lots of fun for the first 10 to 20 hours and after a while as you progress in the game your fun will diminish slowly and convert to frustration as you reach end game content the game mechanics for the last dungeon darkest dungeon are what gamers has been complaining about i have to admit that they are right the game turns to be an absolute grinding cycle in the end i have started new games several times just to fiddle with different team compositions different trinkets and different sets of skills after all this hours of deep playing into the game i can surely say yes there are balance issues and surely the end game grinding kills the fun out of it but if you ignore the last dungeon at least until the devs decide to rebalance or change it you are definitely looking at a gem ps the narration although it gets repetitive after a while is simply astonishing i have to admit that i may have watched the intro at least a dozen times and started at least half a dozen new games just to watch the beginning cinematic,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this game starts off great but becomes borderline unplayable mid to late game artstyle narration and atmosphere are pretty much 1010 and the first maybe 1020 hours of the game though im generally a slow player are a ton of fun the dungeons are hard but also rewarding and interesting your characters grow or die develop their individual traits and get on your nerves with their quirks in a good way the fun ends once your characters level up to the higher quest tiers there are level 1 3 5 and with the darkest dungeon presumably level 6 quests once your characters reach the respective level they refuse to go on lower level quests which generally would be fine the problem is that the difficulty scaling from one tier to the other is insane and level ups themselves dont do anything for the characters you will therefore be massively underleveled if you havent been extremely successfull in upgrading your guild and your smithy and getting loads of money to then actually upgrade your heroes you can then either send your best guys on runs theyre not prepared for and either see them die or spend most of the money you get on their recovery or you grind ridiculously small rewards with new arrivals a lot of people are complaining about the rng but i honestly didnt have any issues with that yes sometimes it can feel unfair and your party gets ed because of a series of terrible rolls but other times youll see them destroy a boss with him barely being able to get a hit in so yeah thats rng for you what really ruins this game for me is its insane difficulty scaling and artificially stretched length i have started a couple of runs and have never gotten past the level 3 quests to be fair i can be pretty bad at video games but it seems like a lot of people are having similar experiences so i dont think its just entirely that the game still has a lot of good elements and i cant say i completely advice people not to buy it its just that actually finishing it is an enormous pain in the and id reckon most people wont actually see the end if theyre not extremely determined and have a very high tolerance for frustration makes for great streams though,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,invested 120 hours playing this game with the hope that it will get better as my heroes level up and find better trinkets and all when its all said and done im left with the feeling of wasted time,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i love lovecraft i love brutal games i love strategic turn based rp and i loved this gamewhen it first came out and to be honest i still do love it but it isnt fun anymore this game is no longer fun the difficulty curve as of recent patches is just crazy now and skill wont offset it you just have to hope for good rolls of the dice and thats fine if the grind to breed heroes wasnt so great that alone as well as the fact that there isnt a way to loose at least xcom difficulty scaled at least you could prepare for losses and it felt urned at least you could actually loose the game and know you were crushed darkest dungeon it just waits for you to stop playing it developers fix late game gameplay fix the difficulty swing to something actually fun going insane and dying used to be fun i want to like this game again i recommend what this game used to bebut i do not recomment what it has become,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,you remember our venerable house opulent and imperial gazing proudly down i hear this in my sleep we plummed the depths i alone returnedi dare not return lost companions suffered afflictions lingering gold trinkets and baubles now remains the task of carrying it home if you live for adventure by all means bring few torchesyou remember our venerable house opulent and imperial gazing proudly turnbased combat complex leveling system town heroes abilities gear punishing as fkthis is not a game for the casual gamer if you long for the days of megaman nes difficulty but with modern complexity an rpg element and lovecraftian greatnessyou probably already own this game if you fall into such a category and dontyour wallet is probably open with cc inhand to throw money at red hook for this game disclaimer i had a relatively negative albeit truthful review of this game for earlyaccess but deleted it because the complaints were entirely rectified by the implementation of the antiquarian class,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,bought early access thoroughly enjoyed it game has become worse and worse each update the fact that you cant take heroes into the final dungeon more than once means you have to grind 5 different teams to level 6 and then equip them with proper trinkets to survive complete time sink and not fun at all i am well past day 100 i dont want to have to play hours of the same repetitive missions just so i can complete the game it seems i will not be finishing darkest dungeon after all these hours i enjoyed the game how unfortunate,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,beyond the artistic merits i was largely unimpressed the game is inexplicably punishing to the point of frustration here me out i am no meek gamer in the strategy world i have completed shogun 2 on legendary and xcom on impossible ironman i can take the beatings if the game world and mechanics make sense and i get a feeling that i am contributing to my goal in darkest dungeon there is one difficulty i suppose the designers have tried to incorporate what is known as cognitive flow in game theory 1 by allowing your to choose the level of dungeon you enter with your party you can roughly match your party to a suitable dungeon in levelwise as well as tactics wise if you go ruins dont take bleed damage for one example then it becomes apparent that the designers have know idea what they are doing and then break the cognitive flow by not allowing you to game the game you cant take a level 3 character into a level 1 dungeon you cant use your battle skills outside of battle but then you cant take an extra 23 rounds in battle to heal wounds and stress because the game will punish you with more stress for bothering to try entering a level 5 dungeon is less like a move from 3 to 5 and more like a move from 3 to 10 if you know what i mean beyond the obvious imbalance in the game the game will then double and triple punish you with the inane random dice that i wonder why even try in the first place it feels like my skill and knowledge of the game becomes more irreverent the higher the dungeon level ironically the stress attacks in the game cause real stress to the player that is they are so frequent and critically boosted that it causes noend to frustrations where is the fun lads minor gripes include the carry space is far too small for the amount of item types in the game forcing more contrived choices with the only goal of annoying me further there is not enough gold earned in the game used for nearly everything useful there are too many heirloom item drops in the game used to unlock and build up your town i am left to assume that the refusal to balance the game properly and provide either adequate difficulty modes or a proper working cognitive game flow is a sign of artificially inflating the playtime of the title taken into account the annoying slow popups that lock the control on the party the tedious animation loops and the drawn out combat all of which compound to my suspicions i hope with their financial success they make another game and address these issues forthwith but for me i didnt like this game despite really trying and pouring 50 hours into it this is the counter point to looking for long games to use as an example of good games this is the same problem with games like counter strike go were i clocked up 200 hours before a realisation of wtf am i doing i didnt actually enjoy nearly all of my time in those worlds to me they will be be forgotten and never explored again what both these titles have in common is the overuse of catchy gimmicks in gameplay and exploit this fully with shallow questrewards the length of the game is not equal to the quality of my enjoyment i was annoyed frustrated bored and wishing i would just find a better game to play 1 httpwwwgamasutracomviewfeature166972cognitiveflowthepsychologyofphp,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,when you say dangerous how dangerous do you mean,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,pretty generic dungeon crawler with lots of rngelements up to a point where the game resembles gambling with the options you are given at your proposal gameplay and fights are solid but nothing special you are usually pretty low on ressources and manpower but thats the kick you get out of these games the game catches the atmosphere pretty well music dialogue and drawings are spectacular for an indie production if you are on a search for a nice rogue like dungeon crawler here are some alternatives which id recommend over darkest dungeon south park the stick of truth roguelike no dungeon brawler yes hilarious story pretty good immersion and the fighting is similar as in darkest dungeon not truly a rogue like as it is static by design but still a good game overall invisible inc roguelike yes dungeon brawler no less fighting than darkest dungeon but very rogue like this is also a very tense game where ressources are notoriously scarce instead of brawling through the stages and killing stuff you have to make up your mind to get your job done quickly with as few encounters with enemies as possible because things can quickly run out of control also rng dependent but in a much better and calculable way get darkest dungeon if youre into games like poker or when it is on sale,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,great game marred by questionable design decisions claims that the game is completely unbalanced are overstated as once you get a hang of the mechancis youll be able to overcome about seventyfive to ninty percent of the games challenges whether you happen to be particularly good at the game or not and then youll spawn a dimensional shambler randomly not by interacting with the curiowalking down the hall in a short level one dungeon with a party that couldnt hope to deal with such a creature at full health not to mention while exploring the very last hallway on low health after completing the dungeon you wont be allowed to run away or withdraw and your stressed out heroes will do stupid things that will get the whole party killed youll watch helplessly as your party dies it will have nothing to do with your knowledge of the game or your personal ability itll just be random bad luck and either youll suck it up git gud by senselessly griding out another party of adventurers or youll go play games that are actually challenging because of the decisions you make rather than completely random rolls on the encounter table beating this game isnt so much a question of skill as it is persistence it is a testament to how otherwise fun this game is that ill probably come back in a week or two and pointlessly bang my head against the pseudorandom challenge that is darkest dungeon again,-1,1

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,what a punishingly cruel and fantastic game im on my third attempt at a play through without having used any guides or anything of the sort so far and i cant break myself away from this game my first few attempts were heartbreaking and miserable at best and i mean that in the best way possible if youre looking for a game that will challenge you and beat you down into the ground for little mistakes look no further i hear a lot that its entirely luck based and there is a great deal of luck to it as with any rpg game with random modifiers however proper planning and well thought out tactics can save you from the most perilous of unlucky occurrences this game is strictly 100 based on how well you can manage a team and make good decisions based on very bad circumstances if you hate games that will stress you out please dont play this game but if you revel in triumph through great trial and tribulation definitely pick this game up its worth every penny,1,1

262060,Darkest Dungeon®,this game has enormous potential all of which is ruined by the combination of its two biggest weaknesses rng and lvl 5 dungeons starting off the game it will most likely feel difficult for most people however after a few introductory dungeons youre gonna get a feel for the general strategy the game forces upon you all is going fine and dandy except for a few bosses until you get to the max level lvl 5 dungeons which provide the preendgame of darkest dungeon this is where the intro screen isntructions of the game come in at full force youre not trying to beat a dungeon youre trying to get through it by the skin of your teeth almost always losing at least one hero you are at the mercy of rngsus praying so that the enemy unit doesnt crit you twice in a row instantly resulting in death if you fail your deaths door check ive put over 80 hours into this game ive read through most of the wiki i watch youtubers on a daily basis who mostly play this game i havent even reached the final dungeon you might say well git gud but herein lies the other big issue with this game the easiest comparison you could make is with dark souls both games are extremely challenging provide little to no information for the player and at points seem completely unfair the biggest difference is that in dark souls most deaths that occur can be attributed to misplays on the players side here most of my failed dungeons come from being chaincritted in the second fight of a long dungeon at best youre trying to minimalize the losses youre going to suffer at level 5 ive always liked challenging games but this one is simply unfair the new town events somehow after the communitys outrage emphasize these weaknesses even more rng playing a huge part in your success im baffled by the fact that not only does the developer not give two about the biggest problems with an otherwise extremely promising game they even boost those issues further in newer content,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,grade a time play 60 hours mostly offline i want to state first that darkest dungeon is far and away the best and most complete early access game that i have played the systems are basically finished with the team mostly just fine tuning now the art is fantastic and imaginative both with characters and environments there is plenty to do the game is only really missing the final two areas and and a handful of character classes which should be arriving shortly dd is a hard game but it has an interesting fallback heroes are free you can recruit them endlessly so it is nearly impossible to actually fail which is good because nasty things lurk in the depths if you have read hp lovecrafts works and you should then this will seem very familiar in a good way much like lovecrafts protagonists your heroes will mostly end their stories by going insane and dying this is one of the most interesting facets of the game stress in dd your heroes are vulnerable and scared they dont enjoy being assaulted by pigmen with bone clubs walking skeletons frighten them starvation is sad basically they act a lot like real people and its great the quirk system is similar your heroes acquire charactersitics as they plumb the depths most of them weird your crusader may have been a holy hero once but 10 weeks at the estate and he has become a nymphomaniac with syphillis and an obsession with corpses necrophilia anyone p getting good at the game will likely take awhile there are a lot of classes and each one has numerous skills they can use in battle and while camping learning how to managae your money provision your party for journies and what buildings to upgrade first can also be confusing it is all very doable it mostly just takes time because it is different you will get used to it if you give it a chance basically dd takes a sort of george rr martin view of adventuring there are a lot of details that you do not encounter in say a final fantasy game heroes actually need food for example torches dont last forever characters dont take crushing blows from a cleaver without reaction sometimes they start screamng in unknown languages and then murder your hapless doctor its a muddy bloody good time and larks for all last words experimental gamedesign done right with some fantastic art direction and ideas that results in a rpg masterpiece keep up the fantastic work red hook games edit 1 july 29 2015 so i wanted to revisit this review after spending some time with the new updates the game is progressing nicely with some new bosses and various quality of life fixes definitely a lot of hard work being put into the game and it looks like it is shaping up to be one of the best rpgs around the developers have been very responsive and have accomodated the forum requests and suggestions of fans like myself to a suprising degree still a highly recommended game edit 2 september 29 2015 the cove update was just released and the game seems to just be getting better and better if you have been keeping tabs on the game you know that there was a wave of backlash over the last while concerning certain gameplay changes i hopw that the discerning gamers out there will try to look past these and try the game anyway most of the criticism is unjustified and mainly related to the nerfing of certain strategies cheese strategies that were near gamebreaking by the way perfectly justified choice on the part of the developer in my opinion i will retrun to the game sometime after full release day and give my final impressions edit 3 after final release well the game is finally out its still good its not perfect and arguably did not live up to all of its promise but is definitely worth the money it is very hard and can cause some frustration so it is unsurprising that dd ended up being pretty divisive if you enjoy roguelikes dungeon crawlers or just plain hard games then youve come to the right place but seriously theres this weird smear campaign going on led by people who apparently 1 take this game way too seriously and 2 are prone to some very weird conspiracy theories about shills and stuff ignore that its just a normal game,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,the short of it if you like permadeath rpgs that have much tactical depth without a steep learning curve and gorgeous if slightly static art darkest dungeon will not disappoint you its punishing and difficult but these nightmarish creatures can be felled they can be beaten the long of it throughout early access peoples opinions on the game have shifted harder than a cultist being bombarded by a bounty hunters flash bang which is the main reason youll still see negative reviews but the solution the developers finally settled on has been the absolute best one and people not updating their reviews to reflect this is the main reason some reviews are still negative darkest dungeon is a dark dungeon crawler heh where you lead a party of four heroes and the items you provide for them into the depths time and again hoping every time theyll make it out alive knowing the possibility is very real that they wont and if they do they might be so traumatized and mentally scarred that you decide to let them spend the rest of their lives wandering impoverished and unhinged the entire game balances on the question what are your heroes worth given the constant influx of new hopefuls itll be very tempting to dismiss heroes or send them on a suicide mission to recover as much loot as possible simply because you cant afford to take care of them because while wounds of the body heal wounds of the mind do not at least not without a sizeable cost in gold that is not to say all your heroes are doomed they can win fights and clear dungeons grow stronger and become heroes worthy of a capital h champions honed and trained for one purpose to brave the depths of the eponymous darkest dungeon when your characters arent delving in the depths of the dankest dungeon you have free time to upgrade the hamlet adding some modest but interesting base building to the mix with the heirlooms your heroes collect from the dungeons you can upgrade buildings whose functions range from upgrading weapons and armour to curing stress and disease or selling trinkets unless of course the heirlooms remain forever in the dark clutched in the dead hands of your adventurers the right of it you will get attached to your heroes and the threat of them dying when they set out into the depths is always very real but good preparation can minimize that risk darkest dungeon uses a random number god who may throw a wrench in even the bestlaid plans but with the games immensely clever and dynamic combat system good planning and calculated responses to unexpected circumstances will do much to win the day so no you have no direct control over the numbers but yes you can make a very significant difference as the player without success or failure hinging on die rolls character classes are so diverse and individually customizable that the possibilities of combining them are endless and a good combination and positioning of characters is a fun challenge every time you assemble a team as is a clearheaded response when enemies mess up your formation and heroes start having to fight in positions theyre not accustomed to the base building aspect while slightly grindy is a streamlined but functional and efficient element and seeing your hamlet get restored from a ruined ghost town to a thriving community is a joy to watch even though the graveyards are packed with heroes who died to make it happen all this takes place in a world full of gothic dark beauty with an art style that never bores even though the game consists mostly of still images animated and moved to reflect what happens this isnt to say that the game is a boring slideshow the camera moves and pans visual effects splatter off the screen and thanks to good animation the entire world is moving and alive add a highly evocative narrator wayne june who provides tons of atmosphere while hamming it up to just the right levels and youve got a gripping experience thatll keep you engaged during every moment the wrong of it if you like highpoly 3dmodels motion capped animations and lighting that makes your 980ti titan chug then youll probably want to pass on this but it would be your loss since the amazing art style and execution is more efficient and powerful than any amount of realism could ever be the animators did a wonderful job too making the still images come alive as the action unfolds also be aware that darkest dungeon is difficult youll need to stay focused if you wish to survive because even trash mobs and there arent many of those can devastate a party if the players concentration lapses because of this heroes will die if you get attached to your heroes like i do this can be difficult to deal with all players so far consider darkest dungeons difficulty to be a plus but if you want to just play a game and have fun without thinking too much you might consider the difficulty a stumbling block be aware that you can and probably should turn off many difficulty options introduced by the devs in early access to discourage certain tactics or make the game more hardcore and thats a good thing some of those options were with good reason seriously disliked by most ea players including myself for making the game unfairly difficult the last of it darkest dungeon is a must have for any role player savescum hater tactics fan or really anyone who likes a solid challenge she can overcome with clever and tactical thinking in fact i can recommend it to everyone except people who play video games purely as a relaxing distraction after a hard work day because it does require concentration and active thinking seriously people red hook created a masterpiece,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,excellent presentation and concept marred by a core gameplay loop based on grinding for gold and disposing of your characters progression is slow and unsatisfying loot is rarely wanted treatment subsystems are essentially meaningless due to expense to get the things you need to upgrade the hamlet and the few good trinkets that exist you need to go through higher level dungeons to go through higher level dungeons you need higherlevel characters to get higher level characters you have to put them through the degredation of leveling up which gives them all sorts of detriments that you cant get rid of because you dont have the money for treatment because you dont have the characters to beat the appropriate dungeons so you just hope for an antiquarian and grind out apprentice dungeons which is for the better honestly the apprentice dungeons are where the game is the most fun difficulty spikes on veteran dungeons are nothing short of grotesque and will appeal only to a certain subset of players it isnt anything like dark souls and mores the pity e game is recommended with the lighter dungeon mod which alleviates much of the grind and makes it easier to take care of your crew,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,dang dungeon is a gritty dungeon crawler thats appealed to a person that usually doesnt like turn based games the artwork is talented and disturbing the music fits the atmosphere i love how daunting and uphill battle the combat music sounds and the game design is clever in its own unique ways as a game dev myself i especially enjoyed the clever game design to keep the player challenged the game clearly has an agenda to break any sort of easy routine and strategy in managing your roster and money and makes sure the player knows this through mechanics for example in the game you are forced to send a party out each week to advance time however to prevent the player from endlessly farming easy quests with the same heroes to prevent them from advancing a week with no effort your heroes will eventually grow bored of the apprentice quests and refuse to take part so you will have to spend resources to send out rookies which wont be able to easily roll those quests as much as your vets while the game has a lot going for it for game design there are still a few flaws it feels like the games difficulty agenda gets ahead of itself and bad stuff can happen to you for seemingly no reason just to throw you for a loop this would be fine if the game would outright state its trying to you but instead it does it in ways that seem to resist its own rules for example for no reason at all even without being marked the 4creature party will continually focus one of your squishier heroes into the ground you can try using a manatarms or crusader to mark themselves but when this is happening it usually doesnt help and theyll continue to slaughter the one character you have all of these abilities but occasionally the game refuses to listen and will throw any advantages you have from those abilities out the window despite the negative reviews a frustrating set back once in a while should not really overshadow the games polish well thought out game play and clear love the developers have for it a game is not bad because you cant beat it i havent been too far along yet but ill definitely play more however ive seen some complaints about the endgame and it sounds incredibly unpleasant so unless something really clicks i only really see myself playing this until i succeed in my first assault,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,im not gonna deny i am a massive fan of this game come to think of it it would certainly be in my top 15 games of all time but before i sing this game any praises i want to share my thoughts on some criticisms people bring up when talking about darkest dungeon and how i feel about gameplay in general this is going to be a long one but i just feel the need to talk about this in detail many people like to compare darkest dungeon to dark souls and i think it is fair to a degree both games have dark brooding aesthetics and pose a significant challenge to the player while having a steep learning curve but i dont think the core principles of these games are alike in dark souls the player is in control all the time the game will not offer you help nor will it deliberately undermine your progress and make your life harder there are no unknown variables either as soon as you are comfortable with your character and know all the patterns thats it you will never lose if your mechanical execution is perfect it is not the case with darkest dungeon however there is only so much you can do to succeed but it is not entirely up to you this is why a major component of the game is risk management since you cant outskill your enemies with perfect tactics when your party is at the brink of death sometimes you just have to cut your losses and escape this is a big part of getting good at darkest dungeon learning when you should and more importantly shouldnt press on to be fair if you get good at this game you will succeed at the overwhelming majority of your quests but sometimes the game will destroy you this is why i think an apt comparison would be online poker an important distinction because in ordinary poker there is a whole another level of mind games you have to play smart and hedge your bets if the odds are not in your favour it isnt worth committing in many cases of course there are times when you have full house but the game has straight flush the thing about darkest dungeon however it lets you stack the deck in your favor by effectively utilizing party combinations properly equipping your characters and using tactics to your advantage why am i telling you this and why is it important i feel like a lot of people go into game with false expectations feeling that its gonna be a dark souls experience to the letter and end up being disappointed or thinking they were misled which is often followed by criticizing the game for not being what it never supposed to be the game does well what it was created to do and it never pretended it is something more than it is so before you post an angry review blaming stupid rng remember that it was a part of the deal and you agreed to it i think rng is pretty welltuned actually fringe cases dont happen that often does rng makes the game worse than similar games that dont rely on it i dont think so and the good thing is there is plenty of room for all kinds of games with rng or without it now lets talk about the game being grindy by nature many games are grindy in one way or another because all of them have some sort of gameplay loop if you dont enjoy the loop itself or have no incentive to continue you will be bored and it is of course very subjective im gonna be honest here via gameplay means the game doesnt do a very good job of motivating you to keep playing it doesnt make you feel empowered as you progress nor does it let you essentially overpower the game by putting in time like some rpg games that let you get the best equipment and faceroll through hordes of previously challenging enemies what did it for me is that i actually enjoy said gameplay loop and the fact that the world of the game and the story intrigue me greatly so i was very excited to uncover bits and pieces about it as i go with gameplay out of the way its time to talk about other things the game has to offer and boy it has to offer a lot it is hard to me to separate from each other elements like music visuals sound design and story because they work together so well yeah lets call it presentation and it is mindblowingly good if i had to name a game i played that nail its aesthetic and presentation the most id name darkest dungeon in a heartbeat the art in this game is great and consistently dark and depressing enemy design is terrifying and intimidating accompanied by wonderful sound design and music that gets progressively more intense as your torch runs out of steam the story is intriguing and for the most part told by the narrator voiced by one and only wayne june it is so ridiculously wellwritten and voiced that id dare to say that it is even better than narrators from games like bastion and the stanley parable and believe me it hurts to admit it because i absolutely love bastion and rucks but the ancestor is just too good did i already tell you how wellwritten it is even if i did it is worth mentioning twice i dont know how they havent tun out of pompous words to use the writing is chock full of them i wouldnt be surprised if a typical dinner at red hook consists of oxford paperback thesaurus a couple of entries form h p lovecraft the complete collection and for the dessert a vintage websters third new international dictionary 61 that was a good year in conclusion i absolutely recommend you to buy the game unless you dont like challenging games hate any degree of rng in games or dont like playing games unless they constantly motivate you to keep playing maybe this review is too long and nobody will read it or it will be downvoted into oblivion just because i am happy i said whet i wanted to say,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,i had a lot of fun in the beginning but at the moment it is far too unbalanced up to lvl 3 dungeons the game is too easy and lvl 5 dungeons are too much influenced by randomness and luck the game needs to be rebalanced then i would highly recommend it to other players,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,divine addicting beyond human ken nothing beats the sheer pleasure of feeding your life to the screen at 2am with less than five hours of sleep till normality just to beat the wizened hag and screaming in terror as your hellion is dipped yet again into the cauldron part management game part deep tactical rpg part drug easy 2016 goty contender for me,1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,great concept with a few serious short comings the initial apprentice dungeons and intermediate veteran dungeons are difficult yet well balanced and rewarding this isnt the case for the champion dungeons i understand the game is based on the concept of making the best out of a bad situation but the late game difficulty spike is ridiculous basic enemies encountered in champion dungeons are seemingly on par with previous boss fights my best heroes max level equipment and skills were more often than not getting hopelessly roflstomped 23 battles ineven on short scouting quests to make matters worse management mechanics become increasingly skewed for example the weird level cap system prevents heroes from partaking in quests below their corresponding level making it unnecessarily difficult to train badlyneeded replacements and raise funds overall late game play feels less about exploring dungeonssmighting evil and more about bolstering lost gold and manpower tediousunrewarding grinding after a couple hours of frustration i threw in the towel i doubt i have the motivation to finish it in its current state total shame i really enjoyed it up to this point i realize red hook has plans to implement a short mode hopefully they address some of these issuesgive the game more massappeal until then i cant recommend this to anyone but hardcore rpg fanscasual gamers stay away,-1,1
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,was one of my favorite games when it first came out as early access was widely considered earyl access done right unfortunately thats not the case anymore the developers added too many features that made the game very grindy in the name of their vision i know this is what they intended to do but the game is no longer fun it used to be enjoyable to get frustrated at taking a risk and getting brutally punished for it now its just play it safe and pray to rngesus ive gotten increadible stupid luck when it comes to some battles where i was stuck in loops of high crit attacks 5 enemy crits in a row on the same character and healing them every round so i wont loose them it used to be stressful in a smart way now its just infuriating and annoying,-1,0
262060,Darkest Dungeon®,while any good roguelike serves to punish you for make mistakes darkest dungeon takes this a step further the game is designed to punish you regardless as to your choicesnot just by making the game more difficult but my making the game pointlessly long the game forces you to continually grind lower level quests while your highest level heros have to relieve stress possibly for multiple weeks late game forces you to only use your heros once for the final quests meaning if you have a great team comp and you complete one of the final quests you have to start from square one if you want that team comp again certain quests sack your village causing you to have to restore ityes you can stop this but after beating it the first time it offers you no reward for doing so making the game even longer i would say that 34ths of my play time was spent mindlessly grinding just so that i could get on with the story only to fail because of a bad miss and have to start again the core concept and gameplay is interesting albeit repetitive but it is unneedingly punishing in ways that dont make the game interesting punishment should come due to making bad decisions but in the darkest dungeon punishment comes because they want to keep you playing longer and that just isnt fun,-1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,the pc version of gta v is definitely the best version we had to wait really long but the game finally came out in a fantastic state rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the pc portversion im usually against preordering games but i made one exception this year for gta and im happy with my decision i didnt do it for the preorder bonus because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat i did it just so i could preload all gbs in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big im running it at 6090 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on high except for the advanced options which is something you should only use if your running sli or one really good card i have a nvidia gtx 680 which is a few years old now so im very impressed with how good i can get the game to run you can also use geforce experience with gta because nividia released a update for that day before launch you can play gta in first or third person mode and simply change between them on your controller all cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person some textures are a little blurry in first person but that is something to expect in a game of this size fighting swimming walking can also be done in first person so you can just pick what you like the best if you have an ssd drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for gta because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long its one of the only complains i have with gta actually thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written you can swap between them in the open world but also in certain quests michael trevor and franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then gta ivs only character niko gta online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in i really just bought it for the singleplayer experience but after playing a few hours with my friends i have to say that gta online is actually really fun i think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run but to play freeroam with friends will never get old you also unlock heist in level 12 so that might refresh things even more i play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends ive talked to is doing the same thing i strongly recommend it at least for the driving you can enable autoaim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard or you can swap between your keyboardmouse in combat and use controller for driving when you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates which i think makes you feel more immersed in the game i tried the pc controls and i didnt like them at all for example you have to hit z to see how many players are on your server in online mode you can however rebind all keys on keyboard mouse and controller so thats really good but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid gta is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come i have already played it a lot and i feel like i have much more leveling to do in gta online much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come singleplayer was all i really needed so i will just see gta online as a plus well done rockstar this is the best pc version you have ever made and i can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it strongly recommend this title to all my friends whether your the single or multiplayer guy you will have a ton of fun this will probably be one of the best games released this year,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,first of all rockstar is not banning for single player mods theyve now stated this outright i mean seriously when did we start believing people who were banned just because they say theyre innocent 90 of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies not only that but they have no changed the eula either if you have a dll injector installed in your game directory it doesnt magically stop working when you go online just because you dont use it its still there your own fault like seriously when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldnt pick up dll injectors dll injectors are the most common way hacks exist headdesks there are two groups of people actual cheaters who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer dll injection and then theres people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online newsflash its still there its still injected into the games memory in any case the game is great theres a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out as with any game so soon after launch but overall it performs great online is fun and you can mod single player not really a lot more you can ask for amirite 910 because i dont believe in perfect scores ps stop being idiots edit in light of a few ignorant jackasses heres the proof httpwwwrockstargamescomnewswire im having soo much fun with gtav on the pc but i just have one question about it how come you are not allowing mods for it clarkmatthew63 will i get banned from gta online for using a fov mod or oculus rift mod mattophobia we have always appreciated the creative efforts of the pc modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original gta map mod for gtaiv pc among many other classics to be clear the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for gtaiv recent updates to gtav pc had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications this was not intentional no one has been banned for using single player modifications and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player pc mods our primary focus is on protecting gta online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage disrupt gameplay or cause griefing it also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized they may be broken by technical updates cause instability or affect your game in other unforeseen ways but by all means lets just believe the banned people because they said they didnt do it its not like cheaters to lie about it or anything,1,1

and ps3 in mid2013 and then got a remastered version on xbox one and ps4 in late 2014 before finally being released on the pc in april 2015 the game quite rightly is a record setter selling over 11 million copies and grossing over 800 million on the release day before breaking the 1 billion marker three days afterwards gta v continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer you play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters the game has three main protagonists who each have their own story and plot to go with them somehow all three of these characterss path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each others story the driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game cars feel even more realistic to drive and the games physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them or they hit you the gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also i did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before but gta v sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics i did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times since i was playing the game on mouse and keyboard i found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane but the flying parts of the game are few and far between the main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters these can range from stealing cars for a billionaires collection right the way to robbing banks there is plenty of variety in the missions you can do and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored the game has gorgeous graphics no they arent photo realistic but thats because the games style isnt aiming for that the pc version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming it just puts the consoles version to shame when you compare the two my rig which is a monster couldnt handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p and it just looks fantastic normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time but gta v does none of that each of the textures are all high res animation is absolutely perfect and the lighting effects are some of the best i have seen in any video game as with all gta games you are going to get a blockbuster style story line this is one of the best if not the best plot to any video game and one which i will remember all three of the characters story are so well written and perfectly intertwining with each other the game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it but personally i found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game they fully immerse you into the world of los santos not only is there a captivating main story to the game there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete they all have some sort of story behind them for each character which are all well worth your time in completing the sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these arent real people in front of the ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too there is never a moment where there is just silence whether it is people in the street chatting to each other or someone getting road rage there is always something going on not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map the game isnt exactly hard there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it i have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this but i dont think i actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty los santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made it is bigger than gta iv gta sa and red dead redemption combined whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action round every corner there is something for you to do whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed or not or just earning an honest days work by towing cars that are parked illegally the world is your oyster in los santos the main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in gta v took me just about forty six hours to complete whilst the main story is complete i still have plenty of heists extra missions stunts racesso much more to finish the single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything and it is something i am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months never have i played a game that has made me want to do that more having only played the game through once i cannot be 100 sure on this but i feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose technically gta v is faultless many worried that the pc port would be terrible but they really knocked it out of the park here the abundance of graphical options audio options and options in general really make this a proper pc game the game can be played on a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard normally with gta games i opt for the game pad but the game is so well optimized for the pc the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me it just plays so fluidly i am going to go out on a limb here and say that gta v is one of if not the greatest video game out there today there is absolutely nothing wrong with the game and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game the stellar gameplay exquisite story line and huge open world for you to explore it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,hey guys i dont usually write reviews but grand theft auto v is a game that is absolutely worth it a game that breaked most impressive records of guiness book bestselling actionadventure video game in 24 hours 12 milion copies bestselling video game in 24 hours 564 milion fastest entertainment property to gross 1 billion fastest video game to gross 1 billion highestgrossing video game in 24 hours highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours including hollywood movies most viewed trailer for an actionadventure video game most viewed trailer of an actionadventure videogame 800 milion views graphics 1 graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible the game runs smooth on any kind of gpus and cpus as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements by the way these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details 2 graphic details are the best i have seen especially in an openworld game if i was to tell you all about this topic i would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours because boy there are lots to talk about im just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me a daynight cycle recreation sure this is not something new in its essence it has been done before and not just in gta but the way we see it here its whats amazing the way the light shifts from one period of the day to another its off the charts you dont even realize when the afternoon becomes evening the only way you can tell its that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you b rain again not a new feature actually is quite an old one but the way its been reproduced in gtav you can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact apart from the obvious what makes rain so special in gtav well the sound this is something that not many people talk about yet is one of the breathtaking features of the gamethe way rockstar games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain besides everything else c night time baby sure we had night in gta iv and even before that so why do i mention this well because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows i am not talking just about the graphics aspect what im saying is that the night in gtav gives you the impression of actual liveliness the whole city comes to life its just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever 3 cars are the best looking and are way ahead those weve seen in previous gtas im not talking about a direct comparison because of the obvious reason 20152010 but what im trying to say is that i personally wasnt that impressed at the time by the carshelisplanes in gta4 as i am now in gtav gameplay and features oh yea the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for gtav to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come 1 car control i feel like thanking rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter car control was preety much garbage in gta iv and for this reason alone i had no big expectations for this new series well i was wrong the car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing nfs mw back in the day besides the control there is the sound of the cars engine which is perfectly accurate 2 randomness now what in gods name im talking about well have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help a womans that was about to get a kid whos bike was stolen hitchhiker asking you to take herhim home etc usually for a reward if you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal but baby this stuff gives gtav a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game 3 los santos customs again not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special have you tried modifying the cars suspension of course you did what am i saying but have you actually paid attention of its realism after the change was made well for those who havent and for the ones who dont own the game yet let me tell you that this feature is gamemaking my favorite car in gtav is the grotti carbonizzare also known as the ferarri f12 now think how am i gonna drive that beast on the citys roads especially in areas like groove hilwood rockford these are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads so you cant really drive a ferarri in these parts of the town well you can modifying the suspension to a higher state doesnt just make for visual effects but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads turns hard turns btw if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings for me this is one of the best things ive seen in this game 4 activities driving mission making robberies flying hunting diving piloting aircrafts submarines boats golf tennis cards smoke weed racing playing the stock market you will never get bored in this game not even in single player mode there are so many more things to talk about but the review would be monstruosly long so in a few words buy the game it will be the best investment you have done in a pc game for those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom i can tell you in short that this game excels in every aspect weapons look so realistic in first person mode cars have a mind blowing realistic control weather has never been better reproduced etc glamphf,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,this is the home gta v always deserved but never got until now welcome home weve all been waiting for you edit after playing for a while i can attach a more informative review will update further when enough time is spent with the story and online portion performancewise the game runs relatively well on my gtx 680 i have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size look it up on the internet aside from that the launch has been relatively smooth for me the game world is full of detail put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it its really the kind of benchmarksetting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless in my opinion the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in gta iv driving is a little bit better hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so but to me it feels more responsive shooting can feel clumsy especially in firstperson and the guns dont feel all that special but its still fun in addition to the updated graphics the other pcexclusive features include a custom radio station and the rockstar editor custom radio station is pretty simple add music files to a folder in the documents and youve got a self radio station ingame it works nothing more to add as for the rockstar editor its really simple and fun to use you mainly use markers to change cameras apply effects slow motion et cetera i tested it for a bit and the end result is this youtube video will donbsp,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,well it is finally here and they were not lying when they said the were optimising it they optimised it great even if your pc meets minium requirements you can still run the game at 4550 maybe 60 fps,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,my first day in grand theft auto v i accidently blew up a truck gt mission failed i tried to kill and run towards the enemies gt instantly died i drove a car gt got stuck or destroyed the car i raced with the car gt did not even finish the first lap while the others finished all of them i ran after the civilians gt i did not keep up i went swimming gt i drowned within 30 seconds i flew a plane gt crashed it within 30 seconds i flew a helicopter gt it started to smoke within 1 minute and i still loved the game now i got the hang of it and todays experience is awesome radio stations awesome strip club and strippers awesome tv channels aliens furries and all that weird good stuff awesome movies at the cinema awesome graphics lightning and city awesome gameplay heists missions races etc awesome hours of laughing and tears awesome game i am still amazed by how the game looks like awesome to play with and without friends awesome ing story i have finished the story it was great way better missions and heists also note that you can point your middle finger to anyone if you are on a bike car boat anything you can pick up hockers during the night note that they often wear red clothes you can easily lose the cops by driving offroad if that does not work just call creepy uncle lester he will help you out remember we are all noobs at first gta v is definetly worth the money 1010 cookies,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,game of the year simulator if youre thinking about buying a game and you dont have gta5 you basically need this game beware you need a pretty fast computer to keep up the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but i can play it on a radeon hd 5870 1gb without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive no complaints in the optimization department edit i got a radeon r9 290 4gb video card not long after getting the game and it is a world of difference if you are able to run it at higher settings when you have the minimum settings what you would need to select if running on a 5870 compared against high settings on the 290 its like playing a different game entirely this game is beautiful on the graphics menu i can set every option to the maximum setting and i leave antialiasing at 2x then on the advanced graphics menu i leave everything at the lowest possible setting i hear people with sli titans can barely max outo the advanced menu and i watched a guy on youtube with 4x r9 290s and he didnt even use as high of a setting selection as i did with just one it depends on what framerate you want 120 60 or 30 fps is possible depending if you have the hardware to back it up maybe one day a video card will exist which is affordable and can truly max the game out but trust me this game is able to really well optimized i had originally a quad core phenom ii x4 965 processor in my computer and it ran all cores at exactly 100 solid the whole time i played on any settings i didnt feel like buying a new motherboard just yet so i went on ebay and got a 6core phenom ii x6 1055t to swap in there and instantly my whole game became way smoother it sits at 7080 usage across all 6 cores the whole time i am playing if not more this 56 year old platform can run pretty much any newer game out there but nothing has been able to tap it and use all of its resources so efficiently than gta5 i must say the pc options are fantastic there is a lot of tweaking to do especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks my favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part i can put down my controller and use the keyboardmouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything it just works its perfect the gameplay itself needs no introduction you can do pretty much anything even online play is pretty good first time i played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died 1010,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,most of the online reviews are about online mode actually the single player can be give a 1010 people give negative reviews are the people who buy the game only to play the single player open world its fun to roam around the city fine story can play as 3 characters good graphics good sound effects great sound tracks single player with all collectables and side missions can be played for a long time online is fun gta v is totally worth the price you wont regret playing single player 1010,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,the first thing i read was a tooltip telling me to call a contact called blimp i did this i ended up hiring a blimp i didnt know how to fly so i accidentally flew into controlled airspace i was getting shot down so bailed out assuming id have a parachute i didnt have one i landed in the ocean and survived i didnt know how to swim i drowned playing fetch with my dog chop threw the ball at a pedestrian to see what would happen pedestrian gets but i accidentally pull out my shotgun pedestrian runs away in fear suddenly my dog decides to chase him down and maul him the pedestrian dies go back to playing fetch 2 minutes later an ambulance arrives for the mauled guy runs over chop karma is a i love this game more seriously though ive played every gta since 3 and theyve all been fun but only for a short amount of time i only did missions for the sake of progress and to get new stuff i never cared really not the case with 5 at all i havent come across a single thing that i can point at and say thats not good the depth and attention to detail with every single thing is incredible the character switching really keeps the singleplayer fresh too every featurefacetminigame feels equally or more detailed than games that focus on those specific things alone,1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,so i went and robbed a store killed a few cops and eventually arrivied home by then the gta 5 loading screen was over and i could play the game,1,0
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,great game truly amazing compared to full priced garbage these days free dlc and more i am very happy but not surprised that the game runs so well most likely because its a parallel developed pc game and not a lousy port the missions in this game are extremely fun the heists and the story is very interesting surrounding these three men i did not skip a single cutscene the online portion of this game feels like an mmorpg you level up gain money and buy transport weapons clothes and your very own apartment rockstar is constantly developing content for online and so far the best update for gtao that has ever come out is the online heists well online freemode with randoms feels like world war 3 so i suggest you play on invite only lobbies until you get a decent level nbspmodding is supported by rockstar which is great but keep it outside of online you dont want to get banned dll injectors and such stay away from them since theyre classified as cheats only mod offline i know i didnt review this game like angryjoe however you dont really need me to tell you how great the game and the pc version is totally worth the wait,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,if your game crashes right after opening it download the latest beta video card drivers and restart your pc seems to be an issue mostly with amd users,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,very well optimized for pc consistent 60 fps its really worth my money,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,havent had this much fun in years tt 3 gta vice city and san andreas will remain rockstar classic games forever but this one is the revolutionary ultimate of the gta franchise so far whether you play alone with 1 friend coop public etc you will definitely find something to love about this game with its huge variety of activities driving stunting flying shooting minigames racing and a whole lot more inside a beautiful amp large map,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,i love gta online but i dont like the other people so i usually play in closed sessions by myself one day i was in a public lobby and naturally encountered a hacker i drove a regular car up to him and he transformed it into chrome i hopped into the car with him and he drove it around on the surface of water eventually the car died amp we were stranded in the middle of the ocean he spawned a boat amp a sea plane and we went to his yacht we were joined by more people and we all hung out in the hot tub about six of us dudes all there and they lamented that we had no chicks present so the hacker transformed into a topless girl and the dudes started rubbing up against her and jerking off then the hacker transformed into jesus amp i was all like jesus saw what you did in the hot tub then hacker jesus murdered me with a crowbar i could not get revenge because of course hacker jesus was invincible the end,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,great game awesome concept,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,lets cut to the chase gta v is one of the best games ever go get it immediately now if you want to know more lets expand it a bit then the game is fun and really solid in every way the controls and playability are well implemented and responsive on the technical side it has some really stunning and beautiful graphics and effects the city looks gorgeous and the countryside desert zones woods beaches mountains etc are just amazing the sea is what impressed me the most imo its over the top it feels very realistic and when you stand near the shore you feel video games will never be the same again if a virtual sea can be this overwhelming it really feels this game is taking pc gaming to its limits so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for pc ever having a system capable of running this beast on ultrasettings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it im very happy with this version yes the pc version is awesome and everything is almost flawless as a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do it feels huge coop is really fun and amazing with lots of unlockable missions races heists sports shopping activities and a lot more to do plus they keep adding more and more content the story mode is well developed and it has funny characters in their own gta way the humor is satirical and politically incorrect as it should be in a rated m gta at first i thought the idea of having 3 characters simultaneously was strange and probably not good but when you play it you realize it works really well gameplay wise driving is well implemented intuitive and feels natural shooting swimming running and moving around are too the game is cool as it is on 3d person already but it adds the bonus of a 1st person experience you can switch on the go and its really nice too and with so many types of vehicles ground air and sea and a lot of guns at your disposal it never feels repetitive or boring i love clothing and shopping i have spent hours in the clothing stores shopping is fun on the sound department the effects are stunning and i love the soundtrack a lot of gta v songs now are part of my personal playlists in general a lot of attention was given to every little detail this is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game simply one of the very best games there are for pc justice has been served for pc gamers and the wait was very much worth i absolutely love it so once again if you dont have it yet what are you waiting for you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this see ya in los santos vayamos al grano gta v es uno de los mejores

estn bien implementados y son responsivos en el lado tcnico tiene unas grficas y efectos realmente asombrosos y hermosos la ciudad luce preciosa la campia las zonas desrticas los bosques las playas las montaas etc son todos increbles el ocano es lo que ms me impresion en mi opinin es lo ms sobresaliente se siente muy realista y cuando te paras cerca de la orilla sientes que los videojuegos nunca ms volvern a ser iguales si un mar virtual puede ser tan sobrecogedor realmente se siente como este juego est llevando los videojuegos de pc a sus lmites as que si tienes un equipo slido para correrlo

por hacer adems le agregan a menudo ms y ms contenido el modo de historia est bien desarrollado y posee personajes divertidos muy a la manera de gta el humor es satrico y polticamente incorrecto como debe ser en un clasificacin m gta al principio pens que la idea de tener 3 personajes simultneos era extraa y probablemente no muy buena pero cuando juegas te das cuenta de que funciona muy bien a nivel de jugabilidad la conduccin est bien implementada es intuitiva y se siente natural disparar nadar correr y moverte por todos lados lo son tambin el juego es genial as pero agrega el bono de una

obra maestra y un juego perfecto simplemente uno de los mejores juegos que hay para pc se le hizo justicia a los gamers de pc y la espera vali la pena yo lo adoro este debe ser la edicin definitiva de

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,stripclubs and weed at 60 fps 1010 to be serious though this is the best version of gta 5 no doubt about it the new aditions are wonderful and playing at an uncapped fps is a joy as for gta 5 itself this is now the 3rd copy i have gotten and it is a game i still enjoy playing much more fun than gta 4 was this is pretty much san andreas 2 nice graphics runs well fun gameplay and a bunch of new additions make gta 5 on pc a must own weither you havnt play gta in the past or not get your hands on this if you are looking for an open world sandbox gta game one more thing the online works alot better than it did on the console versions now all we need is red dead redemption to come to pc rockstar has done a very good job on ths pc version of this and i continue to hope we get rdr on pc before rdr2 drops the singleplayer has always been what i enjoyed for gta5 the online didnt grab me much in the past but with heists now it is improved and worth checking out interested to try more in the editor and hopefully see some interesting mods in the future,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,had this since launch on ps3 have since owned it on ps4 and now pc only game ive ever owned on three platforms managed to transfer all my progress houses cash etc from ps3 character game looks fantastic on pc no wonder it took so long this isnt your average pc port performance is generally around 60fps on highultra mix with a gtx980ti and i7 config to the game personally id say the campaign is worth the price alone you control three characters with varying degrees of likeability story is lengthy and fun lots of side missions great humour throughout solid script bank heists are great everything you expect from a classic gta game to the multiplayer where a total gem can be found a true openworld title you can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer feel free to just explore or undertake in the endless number of missions available you can even play user created games or create your own online heists were added and although only 5 of them they are a huge amount of fun playing especially with friends each heist requires several setup missions all varied in nature heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for gtaonline why would you need currency online because there is literally a mountain of things to buy 100s of cars planes helicopters yachts weapons properties you need a lot of cash if you want to live the los santos highlife participating in jobs online also pays though not much this could be races team deathmatches stunt rides or contact missions pvp is also pretty well done with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry tip if youre low ranked think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players if youre fed up of players c4ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode which means you can no longer be shot or shoot there doesnt appear to be any online level cap so you can keep advancing though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 minigun my only two negatives would be modders modding splits a community in two some people love it some hate it gtaonline is ravaged by modders my opinion is that modding is fine if on the single player or doing random jokey things online it can lead to hilarious moments shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head but equally ruins the game heres why some may have no intention of harming other players and instead throw endless money on people probably as twofingered salute to rs extortionate cashcards you can purchase with real s 60 for 8m credits great you say not really its fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones noone does missions because its easier to beg a modder for cash you see this in every lobby taking cash from modders can also get you banned from gtaonline so even the good modding is bad online why grind a 30 minute mission for lt50k when a modder drops 2m in 5 minutes sadly this is now the mindset of most players now to the bad modders modders who use mods for pvp purposes this could be all your usual expected pc game hacks aimbots boosted health invincibility teleportation etc but it can also be so much more modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button they can set it so players spawn and instantly explode leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down gta in task manager they can change the rain to jumbo jets crashing pcs as they cannot cope with the strain 100s of jumbos falling causes griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage they can drop ufos on you when youre trying to fight fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars its literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server best option is to change servers but most the same currently second negative is just a general lack of cool details in los santos in san andreas if you saw a pinball machine or a pool table chances are you could use it in gtav this isnt the case not a massive issue just an observation there is so much more i could say about the game overall the amount of free dlc added since launch plus endless xp events and sales held weekly for ingame items new gamemodes this is by far the best value for money game ive ever bought 35 is almost incredible given the trend of charging for dlc etc rockstar have given it all for free,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,grand theft auto v does it really need an introduction in gta v you explore a huge open world as three very different criminals what you do is up to you as los santos and blaine county offer a wide variety of activities legal and not so legal on the side of main missions heists and side missions los santos and blaine county are not only explored through our three story protagonists you can also take to the streets sea and sky with a custom created character usable in both the online game modes and the director mode speaking of game modes gta v has three main modes first off we have the afore mentioned story mode featuring our three lovable criminals theres not much to say about this one apart from whats already been said secondly we have gta online where you can complete jobs and participate in other activities with friends and others using a character you create lastly we have the director mode which allows you to play as any of the characters found in los santos and blaine county as well as giving you access to a number of cheats this game mode is designed to be used with the rockstar editor to create short filmsvideos before i continue with my review i just want to point out i also have around 150 hours of game time on xbox 360 on top of my pc game time fantastic graphics even if you arent running the game on ultra this game looks fantastic excellent gameplay from driving to flying to the games gunplay everything feels satisfying and reasonably realistic by this i do not mean it feels like it would in the real world rather it simply does not feel fake a good engaging story with excellently made characters as mentioned earlier the game world is huge fantastic voice acting particularly the three protagonists a rather large array of weapons to choose from each with a number of purchasable attachments and cosmetic changes a variety of settings to be seen throughout the game world numerous different radio stations available while driving each with a fair few songs as well as the ability to create your own radio station with your own songs a huge number of vehicles ranging from mopeds to jet airliners most land vehicles have a number of upgrades and paintjobs available a number of different camera angles in vehicles and on foot including a first person camera which is an awesome edition to the game several activities to take part in outside of missions such as racing tennis golf and more lots of clothes tattoos and several hairstyles available for the protagonists and your online character already a number of mods available ill return to mods later rockstar have released quite a bit of free content since the release of gta v gta v comes with an intergrated video recorder and editor which allows you to create short filmsvideos with relative ease the rockstar editor can also be used to create beautiful screenshots of the game using frames from a recorded video and then adding filters to them a lot of gta online missions controls are great played with a gamepad the online character creator isnt particularly good and doesnt give you much control over your characters features open lobbies in online are absolutely filled with hackers and if the hackers effect your character in anyway you run the risk of being banned by rockstar if you leave your mods enabled when you enter gta online you run the risk of being banned this means you have to go to the effort of disabling mods everytime you wish to switch between sp and mp rockstar used some questionable business practices during the steam summer sale it didnt effect me as i already owned the game but i feel it was worth mentioning gta online uses rockstars social club drm rather than steamworks which is not only frustrating because it means going through another drm it also means online relies on rockstars servers which have had a number of issues loading times are awful ive only seen one game that has longer loading times than gta v getting rp basically xp and money in online requires a ridiculous amount of grinding and in online money really does buy happiness which makes this irritating verdict an essential purchase 9510 gta v particularly online does have its issues but when it comes to open world freedom and enjoyment nothing comes close with fantastic graphics excellent gameplay lots of weapons lots of vehicles and a huge world this really is not a game you should pass up on no drama just reviews el k,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,hello community i have decided to write a review about gta v first of all i love the game series sooo much and i have played them all since gta 1 so i hope that my review will be quite objectively please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me after playing gta v more than 300 hours i think now its time to discuss buisness pros the singleplayer in this game is awesom there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more the storry from singleplayer is great good redline through the game with lots of fun missions and great heists graphics on high end pc are quite nice could have been better d fantastic ambience throughout the whole world amazing masterpiece of soundtrack the radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect tv and internet all thumbs up d cons the multiplayer i have waited sooo long to play a gta game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people but it is impossible permanent laggy gamesessions connection errors all the time friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently hours of loading screens im running this game on high end pc with ssd drive and still loading for hours very low payout rate of money a friend played gta v on ps3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever which takes me to my next point hackers the damn game is full with hackers everywhere rockstar doesnt seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time jumped through 5 puplic lobbies encountered 7 hackers breaking the whole realm shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons teleporting with godmode screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker im sick of them i also am sick of players joining the lobbies first question asked is there a hacker here i need money wtf such aholes should be banned too right from the moment they typed in this question dont missunderstand me here i have a 0 tolerance policy for hackers they ruin everybodys game expierience and people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion last words i really love the game and i will continue to play it but im not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance i will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design the multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me d rockstar please solve the hacker problem i would totally recommend gta v to everybody but be aware of the multiplayer maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price you will totally not regret buying it then best regards boudewijn ijzenarm,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,goodbye life,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,i liked the part where the 2 dogs ed 1010,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,while the pc version of this outstanding game is new its been out long enough on consoles that i dont need to go into every single thing about the game so ill just sum up what i personally like alot and dont like not too much likes the environment an insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of la ls to near perfection having been to the actual city several times i could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game the viper roorm ripleys believe it or not museum the scientology center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same when the sun sets and rises all of the lighting is accurate and at times absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around mt chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities its some of the best weather fx ive seen in a game because it feels real roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes it truly feels like a living world the satire what i feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle thats so prevalent in la across all social classes the rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way its never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto the signage and radio commercials are also perfect knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself this can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations the characters there are many who dislike the characters especially trevor and i can see why but i liked them because of how they played off of one another michael the would be retiree whos juggling family problems franklin a young man growing up in the hood doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle trevor the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey none of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but theyre all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them the voice actors do an a job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life the first person mode not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made its also one of the best fpss in years being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes the radio stations theres nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking we built this city by starship or heartbeat by don johnson if you like pop rock country rap trance or even talk radio theres something here for anyone to like dislikes the police they seem overly aggresive and i dont know if thats a play on the lapd or not but there have been time that ive simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds also while in a car ive been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot i could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me the storefronts i just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but i also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world id be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games the sub and the helicopter for me the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode the model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few the helicopter while fun could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets thankfully rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this real time destruction again like the storefronts i know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and wed probably be lucky to get 1030 frames per second with physx cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments extra activities given the sun and sand vibe of lsla i wish that you could surf and skateboard seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth thats not to say they couldnt add these things in a dlc pack fingers crossed but i just find theior absence strange and overlooked those nitpicks aside this is still one of the best games ive played in a very long time and with so much to do ill be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time overall score 9 out of 10,1,1
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,honestly what can i say about grand theft auto v that hasnt already been said i enjoyed my time in los santos just as much as anyone else although i feel that theres so much to praise and criticize rockstar on with this product that all of it cant fit inside the confines of this review aspects of grand theft auto v worth praising,1,1

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,played it for a few hours on pc i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version it seems to run much smoother looks nicer the controls are easy driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together rockstar definitely proved me wrong after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall oh and no more gfwl yes well done rockstar definitely worth buying,1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,to those thinking about this game post free weekend around september 5th 2015 and forward this is for you tl dr dont get evolve for reasons listed below from an active community member to one that has had his heart crushed with how this game came to be four areas covered in review 1 context and game development 2 productdlc release cycle 3 gameplay and mechanics 4 the community and match making 5 summary 6 my playhours justified context and game development for those that continued reading ill start off with some context since the games launch in case many newcomers do not know or care to do the research the game was released earlier this year post a very productive alpha and beta however shortly thereafter you may have heard of the dlc uproars and consistent bugsglitchesfails that plagued the retail version for a very long time prior to any patches due to development focusing on the production cycle the fixes were set in parallel to what developer provided the console version therefore realize this that some bugs still exist talking about the stupid cursor bug that happens once in awhile and a few others due to a delayed patch cycle even with patches many things seem to be a 1 step forward 3 step backwards type of deal that is due to the rapid pushout of dlc the game has continued to experience new problems most patches or just pure errors that again take time to fix productdlc release cycle ill be short and sweet with this the dlc release for the game many find exploitive and attrocious as for my opinion i am fine with the dlc but as of late it has become a disappointment in the beginning the dlc was standalone most of the dlc was cosmetic as skins for weapons character or class specific and what not the skins themselves were weapons only meaning the overall design of the characters would not be altered in any form besides weapons or color schemes but this has changed with the release of the meteor goliath upon release of new characters monsters were sold individually and so were hunters this individual sale was where the problem resided after a community uproar the sale policy was changed and those tier 4 characters were provided via season pass 1 same to the tier 5 characters with the introduction of the season pass 2 yet it did take time to change to this bulk buy concept to trs turtle rock studios defense this was their first aaa title and ip so it was still a learning experience but the overall monetization efforts between them as well as the publisher my2k was a big failure gameplay and mechanics yet the most upsetting part was despite the awesome content the combination of new content and a fledging company resulted in terrible balance issues between hunters and monsters even character specific these problems still persist and despite the outcry these problems will continue the issue resides in the process of balancing where character trials are done by pros and esl teams keyword being teams meaning minor balance adjustments pros suggest catastrophically impact the overall public player base due the unreliability of solo matchmaking and metagame mechanics of trackinghuntingteamcomposition to put it in lamens terms the pro teams that provide feedback for character debuffsnerfs or buffs run in teams far more efficient than anything you will encounter in public matchmaking therefore if someone picks something out of the recommended team composition or perks the entire team suffers as random teams cannot perform to the level of pros or regular teams which consist of friends willing to communicate some ways this misrepresentation has ruined gameplaymechanics stems into monster healthsurvivability and just simple things like how ineffective the hunter jetpack has become as of late this misrepresentation results in the whole community debates of monsters too op or hunters too op this disproportionate representation inevitably leads to similar issues of player base segmentation due to skill gaps as described in the following category community and matchmaking finally the last category many will be most interested in as this is still an area of concern and all else aside my main reason to recommend not buying the game the community has risen and fallen multiple times since the games release which has been about half a year almost at the time of review at the moment the community has fallen under the 300 steam mark meaning you cannot view players online in game anymore since the number is so low this inevitably leads to horrible teamplay as skill levels differ so much even more so the new matchmaking 20 makes the traditional hunt mode to be a catastrophic failure as the skill segmentation is done poorly due to the inbalance between players you may have experienced some form or another of said reasons in the freetoplay weekend but these problems will persist postweekend as the player base again levels out more so the overall community is inaccurately respresented in many forms the subreddit for evolve may have more members posting than those playing at a time along with the game developers continuing to favor the input of pros to continue this infant dream of competitive gameplay i say infant due to the overarching problem of a small player base negatively impacting any efforts to improve competitive matchmaking if unknown matchmaking 20 is an effort by trs to promote competitive ranked play prior to mm 20 players could play the traditional hunt mode without any penalty of leaving prior to match completion without penalties in the form of reduced character rank or timeouts mm 20 has shifted the traditional form into only ranked play meaning the original hunt mode was removed for this competive copy and there is no way to enjoy the original hunt form outside of running a evacuation gameplay evac being the 5 day campaign either pvp or pve being 4v1 or 4vcp or custom match with friends summary to sum up my overall decision with the reasons above and with foreshadowing as the game development is plateauing out due to the final push for dlc coming out soon in the form of the remaining tier 5 characters it is a good idea to avoid the game at least until it is within the 20 30 mark however by that time i assume the games player base would have fallen even further so its best to avoid purchasing the game thanks for reading edit sept 5 2015 my playhours justified had this as a comment to address my play hours but people skipped it so heres my justification for play hours to those mentioning my play hours realize my review is based off of the time since the beginning to now post all that development to be frank as many others have mentioned it in other reviews the game was extremely promising in the beginning being visually and mechanically fresh so lets say 250 of those hours were within the first 3 months of game release by that time many dlc and patches came out coupled with balancing issues where my play time dropped drastically as the appeal to the game fell since then the only real reason i do play or continue to do so is due to my own friends playing it far more intensively than i am i became a part of a team and was the dedicated medic for most matches so i cant necessarily leave friends hanging as playing without a dedicated team is tough however recent changes are making that seem like a viable solution rather than continuing as my recent hours played in the last 2 weeks show i only say this as many can understand playing a game to only experience frustration or ending on a sour mood post play is not appealing in any way thanks again for reading,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,so guys i am a founder and i have to say that i am deeply saddend that i am part of the original players of this game also called founders as they are plain stupid how the hell can you say you are not happy with the decision and with the payback you received let me put this straight you bought the game fine played it for 23 months maximum fine stopped playing it okay didnt give a about it for a year okay now heard it went free so you are butthurt cause you dont get back the value of your money tell me how well would it have been if this game went dead and you couldnt even play it anymore would your money have been valued this way get your straight people and stop being irrational s this game is great and will get even better the devs are really good and they care about this game and even more they care about the community way to go turtle rock way to go evolve,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,my dear evolve its time we go our separate ways i tried to make it work you know i did i dedicated a lot of time just for us time that maybe i shouldve dedicated to my wife i mean i dont have any but thats kinda my point 600 hours what we had wasnt casual my friends kept asking me how could i go on with this what they couldnt understand is that although it was always hard to make things work between us when they worked it was something very special im not rich but still i bought new dresses for your monsters new makeup for your weapons took everything to elite status including kala oh yes including kala but even after the holidays after that magical winter time when we met new people even after that your playerbase is still growing cold your followers so few and far between the lag is bringing me down baby our monsters keep freezing the hunters teleporting and the wait oh baby the wait almost two hours just to get a single hunt match as the monster i cant take this anymore i could keep dreaming of the day when people wont have to pay so much to be with us but we both know that this will never happen i held on for as long as i could darling but its over i hold no regrets at least we tried deep down ill always love you ps i wrote down a song for you it goes like this feelin that its gone cant change your mind if we cant go on to survive the tide love divides someday love will find you break those 2k chains that bind you one night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways i think im gonna call it separate ways or worlds apart havent decided yet,-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,great game solid all round in gameplay competitive and a lot of replayability with different stratscompesitions unfortunately the pricing model is disgusting for the game and dlc example 5999 usd for the us 7999 usd for other regions like australia 2k games are milking gamers with this if you are against big name companies like 2k doing this then do not buy this game the negative recomendation will be revoked ifwhen 2k change the way they view their customers from cattle to gamerspeople for those of you who continue to state that i have bought the game please note i was a part of the alphabeta testing played at pax on top of the alphabeta the game is solid but due to pricing issue this review will remain as a recommendation to not buy this is so that others are not blindedblindsided by the current pricing model,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this game isnt worth 60 for the amount of content put into cash shop dlcs the ceo of 2k literally saying there wouldnt be dlc if you just paid 120 for the game this is from a satirical site is not an actual quote from the ceo of 2k but i wont edit what i said out of the original comment as to not misconstrue anything the game had potential but was killed by shifty business practices,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,let me be perfectly honest i absolutely had a blast playing this game in alpha and beta however due to the sort of marketing preorder bonuses and dlc insanity i cannot recommend this game pros varied hunter and monster tactics make for interesting matches intense match progression as hunters and monster playing the monster and getting to level 3 without taking a scratch is the funnest thing ever high level skill cap that rewards a smart playstyle level based matchmaking cons insane exponential progression that seems like theyre padding out the game life ive been quickmatched into a full game just to spectate yeah it was probably a bug no party options for 5 players considering that turtle rock has announced plans for additional dlc as the game develops why is it that i can pay 8588 today for all of the dlc this is a full price game with a f2p model for dlc absolute rage inducing collision clarification i was trapped by a dome and thouight i could escape through a narrow pass but my monster was just stuck running while i got shredded by hunters tldr its a dlc fest ps for clarification i played the beta to the most completion i could 8 hunters and 2 monsters were leveled to skilled star 1,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,this is how you absolutly do not do a launch putting the game up for sale months in advanced then offering more featured editions later with no option to upgrade is a bonehead move of monster proportions you are a terrible company 2k you need to be completely restructured,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,i would discourage againt buying this game the game is shifted to a point where new players must play with other bad players to receive a rank thereafter you will most likely be stuck with terrible players as top players have already formed parties and do not want to lose their rank by losing games with newer players furthermore dlc is continously being released which you have to pay for the downloadable characters are overpowered in order to temp you to buy them but in fact it just ruins the game as it is no longer balanced lastly and perhaps most imperative is the fact that minimal game support is provided to gamers outside their main target markets thus gamers such as myself are forced to play with terrible connections this makes the game almost unplayable if you are paired with someone from a far location which is likely the case since their player base has declined so dramatically the game experience for all concerned is utterly frustrating when this happens ergo at this point i would like to discourage people who are considering buying this game due to the direction in which this game seems to be going,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,so far im really liking this game the only downside for me is the instability in multiplayer let me explain this further update the crashing and dcing stopped since a couple of days the mouse still dissappears and theyre still milking the dlc im still not recommending this game while youre in the middle of an evacuation or skirmish and absolutely wrecking this monster the game can suddenly decide to really you over and dc or just instantly crash and naturally it doesnt save anything during your extermination so this can be pretty rage inducing after an alpha and beta youd think theyve fixed this buuuuut nope out of 10 matches i dcedcrashed on 6 of them losing all my progress the mouse keeps ing dissappearing in its current state i would not recommend it and no i dont got a crappy internet connection and no i dont got a crappy gaming setup also their dlc plans,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,so a few words about evolve to begin with this game has one of the most amazing ideas ive come across in any fps and pvp game you either play as the big badass monster or as one of the 4 hunters thus creating a 1v4 concept that can really blow your mind the real question about any game though isnt how fun the idea is but rather how much does the fun last especially in an online game such as evolve so lets talk about some pros and cons for this game to get more into that matter the pros list 1 the premise upon which this game is built is mindblowing and exciting hunters versus monster thrown into a quite big pvp arena each side with its own strengths and weaknesses 2 amazing graphics and great voiceover suck you into the game straight away creating a great atmosphere of feeling either the hunted or the hunter 3 well thought mechanics for both monsters and hunters requiring smart plays on both sides to be able to win 4 3 different monsters with a 4th coming up with different playstyles 5 12 different hunters 3 for each class and more coming up each one unique in his role than the rest offering great depth to this game the cons list the game is far from polished meaning not only the bugs youll encounter still lingering around but also matchmaking and balance issues that end up being really disrupting for the game experience let me emphasize a bit on the matchmaking and balance issues though 1 the matchmaking of this game sucks have you ever wondered how it feels to have a game that asks for your role preferences and then goes and completely ignores them well thats the case with evolve at the moment evolve asks you to pick your preference in a scale of 5 with 1 being your most preferred role and 5 your least wanted one and guess what the game doesnt seem to care at all you join a game and the role you are given is very so often the last one you wanted to play 2 80 of the games you join are already started while you are given the spot of a previous bot or ai if you prefer player usually without perksstarting buffs you get to choose when you normally pick a role and almost always already in a very bad spot within the game with your side losing hard if you choose to leave the game you get 1 minute penalty which isnt much on its own but trust me it adds up pretty quickly when that happens 5 games in a row especially with all the loading screens you get to suffer each time 3 balance there are a few issues here considering a few hunter and monster characters some hunters being underpowered at this point or pretty useless i should say and some other characters being quite better on their specific role giving you no real options when it comes to choosing what you are going to play for the monster side there is one monster wraith that as it is now rules them all and the problem isnt whether you win or lose but whether you can actually have fun winning or not well thats not the case when you play against the wraith cause usually the hunt sums up to the same pattern 15 minutes chasing it while being impossible to catch as pug hunters then 2 minutes of it wrecking your team cause it reached stage 3 fun the balance issues are known to trs and are said to be targeted with future balance patches and so but time is of the essence here and trs doesnt seem to believe so almost 2 months since game release but no balance patches yet just a minor bug fix patch while they spend their time announcing new maps and skins and characters but ill get to that a bit later leaving their player base overwhelmingly frustrated 27k players at launch 3k players 2 months later so overall balance and mm are what kill the most out of the fun of this game it simply wont let you enjoy the game as you would like to due to the games incompetence to respect your preference towards role and playstyle choices moneymaking games and greed the game is getting 2 free maps at 30 of april 1 month from now while xbox players will be getting the content 31 of march seems fair to me why probably cause microsoft paid some huge money for their console to get priority also while the games community dies fast to the point of no return what we only see is more dlc and paid character packs coming out 25 for 4 new hunter 15 for a new monster 2 months after people already paying 50 to get the base game that sounds pretty crap to me but ill leave that to everyones perception and pocket condition to wrap things up yes this game can be quite fun but after a given time of probably 30 hours or so you find yourself getting more and more frustrated over issues that shouldnt even exist in this game to begin with i wouldnt recommend paying more than 25 for this game especially when you consider the 40 you have to pay to get the new content,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,7999usd for a multiplayer only game that will probbably meet the same fate as titanfall where it will slowly die within 36 months also thanks 2k for charging us a australiannz tax seems like a fun game but im not shelling that much for base game plus hoards of dlc that are to come evolves statement for dlc wwwforbescom edit since people are blind i didnt pay im not supporting devs who are this stingy i was in alpha and it let me review it,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,alright what can i say about this game that hasnt been mentioned already if youre like me you ignored all of the negative reviews of this game because the core concept of the gameplay just seemed so irresistibly unique and interesting if youre like me and youre willing to ignore all of the other problems of this game just because the potential of the gameplay intrigues you then let me talk to you a little bit about the gameplay that you may be oogling over right now simply put its not as fun as it may look its not very strategic very quickly it becomes highly onedimensional formulaic and repetitive theres only one balanced gameplay mode and thats hunt there is essentially no singleplayer hunt unless you take it to a competitive levelgets old fast want to take your game to a competitive level and you dont have three other friends irl who also play the game good luck with that and if by some miraculous chance you do manage to find three internet strangers that are also skilled friendly and willing to take the game to that competitive level with you i must ask how long is that one game mode going to remain fun for you i can tell you from personal experience that even if you do manage to get to that level it still gets old fast in a nutshell thats the breakdown of the gameplay of evolvewhich is probably the only reason youre eyeing this game right now after all now ill get into the specifics of the game a bit more gameplay theres no cat and mouse strategic warfare going on here90 of the time you are running as fast as you can toward the monster and oh that 10 of the time where youre actually hunting the monster youre hunting a wraith and its tediousits not fun when youre not running toward the monster you are battling in a dome against a good monster this will require incredible coordination and positioning between the hunters which you as a random soloqueue pubber will not have and good luck finding other skilled friendly people to play with ill talk about that a bit more later dlc just disgusting disgusting im not even going to talk about this its been beaten to death by everyone already and rightly so it makes me sick 2k should be embarrassed and now that the game has been priced down to 13 or 15 from the 60 i paid at release f u 2k that is all i can say its a slap in the face to those who paid the 60 when it first came out content theres only one viable game mode ive talked about this already it gets old fast balance this issue is notorious for evolve personally i think that the topdown method of balancing that tr has instituted is in fact appropriate balancing is addressed from the perspective of highly skilled players and that is how it should be the last time tr adjusted balancing based on the perspective of random soloqueue notalent pubbers we were seeing such atrocious trash as 45 second dome cooldowns absurdly op hunter compositions and a metagame that wildly favored the hunters in competitive play the game is now closer to being balanced at higher levels of play but due to the basic core concepts of the gamewhich are just not interesting or strategic enough imoevolve will never be truly balanced matchmaking just awful to me this has been the reason why ive finally had to turn away from this game as much as i wanted to like it hunt 20 came far too late and we need more statistics that determine a players skill level than just a pathetic wl rate ive told you in the section above that its imperative to find friendly communicative skilled players to queue with that is hard and it takes a lot of time it took me months to build a friends list of decent players and by that time most of those players were leaving evolve anyway personally i have high standards when it comes to finding players that i enjoy gaming withmaybe it will be easier for you im not sure but i cant tell you how many players ive queued with that just relentlessly complain about the balance of the game rather than taking a long cold look in the mirror and admitting that they are unskilled stop blaming the balance of the game accurately assess your own skill level what you could improve upon and then find better players to queue with its that simple evolve has been such a colossal waste of potential ignore this game at any priceits more frustration than its worth if you buy this game you are letting 2k essentially get away with fraud tldr repetitive gameplay and lack of content make for an experience that is hardly worth 10 let alone the 60 that i paid for it,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,an overpriced hunk o junk from the company who thinks they gold before you buy google any of the following 1 everything wrong with evolve 2 evolve forced preload 3 evolve dlc madness priced at 45 eur for a multiplayer game that they quickly slapped a throwntogether singleplayer mode onto after complaints its already expensive then comes the dlc which dlc to get there are so many different ones expansions to a game that hasnt even been released yet does expanding adding content to something already finished a product thats not even being sold yet sound sensible to you its ridiculous sad to say i got the game last year before sturtle rock2k showed their true colors so im stuck with it edit if it were possible i would refund it it is not possible with the copy i have would i buy it no do i recommend it no should you buy it no is it good nah is it worth the cost no does a game that already costs 75 eur to have a full version of nevermind what future updates will cost tempt you morally or fincancially save your money and buy 3 other games for the price of this nonsense its just not worth it update ive discovered an incredibly positive thing about this game if you delete it youll have 30 gb of extra free space huh,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,15 monster 749 characters repetitive gameplay no play style differences between characters beyond base class barely a selection of monsters poor optimization character personalities are bland and predictable its a freaking moba but without the tower defence edit they actually had to add prerelease statuses to the reviews to try to break credibility from the overall problems with the game the game is nowhere near worth 60 with the amount of base content it has and the amount of extras that require another 70 it doesnt take 60 to tell that to somebody even worse is that aus has to pay 80 so imagine multiplying the cost of the game plus all the dlc just so you can play as a red colored version of the behemoth 7 moss is now a thing when you start announcing preorder bonuses before a single screenshot or official announcement is made you know its gonna be terrible,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i did play the beta and wanted this gamebut then i see the dlc pay wall i mean sure you can play the game with out the dlc but your really lacking in game play i did preorder it mind you with 5 just to ensure i have a copy but after i seen all over the net saying there is day one dlc that feeling in my gut told me to put that 5 on monster hunter 4 u to me if a game has day one dlc to edit by day one dlc i mean the microtransactions for game that is 60 or 70 then that game is a big no no but then again that is just my opinion i have a feeling this is going to be like titanfall it was fun at first but after you play for a few hours you kind of sit back in thinkwas it really worth the price is evovle worth the price i have to say no you would have more fun playing super smash bros monster hunter 4 u hell even old school megaman this game is not a aliens colonial marines disappointment buti would save your money for other games or at lest wait for it to go on sale im sure steam can give you a good deal down the road i also for got to add this bit of info of why i did not get the game httpwwwpcgamercomfaceoffhasevolvetakenpreorderbonusesanddlctoofar,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,ive removed my previous review because it is no longer valid i reviewed the game with monster edition purchased and shortly before the game was launched with beta then afterwards i put about 50 hours into the stage 1 game and then another 40 odd hours into stage 2 to put it bluntly trs has done an amazing job of a f2p port see below the game costs nothign literally nothing as of 8616 you can download the game and play for absolutely free there are no strings attached you get to play the hunters and monster in rotation but its still free not one cent you have to pay for anything this is a huge draw to the new player whom wants to get their feet wet in this glorious game yes i said glorious because the game is such its something you dont see very often and other companies are now copying what trs has developed with evolve stage 2 previously the games were very much slower when i say slower i mean upwards of around 15 to 30 minutes per match at least nobody wanted to play trapper since they were tasked with placing a dome around the monster and if the trapper died then the dome would be brought down its very easy for the monster to focus down one specific hunter even at the cost of their armor and some of their health now any hunter can dome this major change has brought games from a 15 to 30 minute duration to a 5 to 15 minute duration and thats being very forgiving the games are now such a length where people myself included can have a vested interest in the game and keep playing round after round if time permits finding the monster used to be huge pain in the butt im serious about that it was possible for the monster to evade the hunters without ever being spoted until stage 3 when the monster is pummeling the power relay its easier now since the trapper can use satellite beacon and get a general location of the monster trs has made the game possible for hunters and monsters to play rapidly if they choose to do so a 30 minute investment game only to lose is extremely frustrating and you dont feel that when losing or even winning 5 to 10 minutes into the match the game is faster more challenging when fighting and i absolutely love it if youre reading this and are on the fence about the game then give it a shot and decide for yourself seriously the game is free free no strings attached even if you dont have all the hunters or monsters and are playing 100 free then you still have a decent fighting chance the game is designed to give you that chance,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,not even close to worth what it costs it looks like a lot of fun going in but your patience starts dwindling away as the monster wins every time you play online due to your teams poor organization skills i would say this is a best to play with friends game but who am i ever going to be able to convince to spend 70 on a game with barely any content lets not even talk about all the dlc theyre trying to push out too i nearly crapped my pants laughing today when i found out that the fourth playable monster would cost me an extra 15 on top of the 70 ive already paid tldr too expensive not enough content imbalanced repetitive save yourself the money and go buy yourself a bunch of other less expensive better games,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,the maps are too small tbh it feels like another cash cow dont buy it for 97 australian dollars its just amped graphics all in all feels like a rather meh 3040 dollar game at best,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i really enjoyed the idea of evolve when i first saw it the idea of an extreme game of cat and mouse where the monster snuck by under the hunters radar was invigorating the idea that a slip up could lead to a massive disadvantage or even death was amazing and the thrill of outwitting your opponent was even better there was a real thrill in matching wits and seeing whether the hunters could work together and tighten the net or wether the monster could slip a way punching a hole in their formation or simply slinking away unnoticed the hunt was intense and thrilling a slight mistake could spell disaster for either team and could really change the pace of a match stage two has removed these aspects evolve stage two has been simplified and shrunk into a game where the monster must run full sprint to hit stage 3 there is no more cat and mouse no more sneaking stealth is no longer a feature the game is now more about the skirmishes and fighting than the act of actually hunting one another the timer is restricting as even if a monster manages to outrun the hunters and pull a perfect game hes basically left with 3 minutes to finish the match or he loses and with the adjustments made to the hunters passive healing extra sheilding ect the hunters are harder than ever to kill even at stage 3 the monsters virtually garunteed to take health damage even with a perfect execution simply because in their attempt to simplify it for new players the devs have devalued skill the games devolved into more of a brawl than anything else and for me personally thats dissapointing tldr the game used to be about nuance wits and skill made a huge difference the game is now about 4 hunters brawling it out with a monster with a little bit of chasing after in between,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,the alpha seemed like it would be fun for a while or at lan parties the current price is just too prohibitive as a multiplayer game ill think about it once it gets into the 20 range,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,left for dead meets titanfall based on the alpha i would not pay 70 for this game its fun but considering the fate of similar titles such as titanfall i would wait to see how well it survives its first 36 months itll be much cheaper then so valve gimme a call when a goty 4 pack is 80,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,dlc the game dont buy this,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,my heartfelt review on stage 2 of evolve as of octobor 25th 2016 2k has fired turtle rock studios from working on evolve period with 2k stating the game is finished when i began playing this game i loved it to death the chasing the comps the monsters etc players were generally nice many people helped others out and much more after the disaster that was legacy evolve the consistent updates were a huge blessing from trs they came out with new characters new monster adapation refactored some of the old monsters and the plans this game had coming into it man i was excited trs was actually doing something to improve the game and the updates were awesome then came the news above trs was fired from the game by 2k because they felt it was a waste of time no more adaptions adding more maps adding actual lore which was in development and being helped by the community the heart and soul of many players just broke after seeing what 2k did it is also unlikely theyll update the game with any of the future things that trs were working on like a wraith adaption monster and so in conclusion and with great sadness i do recommend this game but not as much since 2k murdered the life of it i will of course update this review if they actually decide to work on it the forums are still alive if you feel like visiting and talking some players will still remain to play together so enjoy it while it lasts evolve stage 2 ill miss you but im going to miss you even more trs for actually putting time and effort to improve this game and the great plans you had for it,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,15 for a monster edit just wanted to say more 15 for a monster preoder dlc arguably even justified worth 60 in content cashshop in my full price game yikes at least there are free maps and game modes right too bad its a complete mystery on what or when or how many gameplay wise its fun playing as the monster is very tense and you get a burst of relief when beating the hunters the hunters are kinda boring most of time because you just hop around looking for the monster but when you fight it it gets pretty chaotic did become repetive after a point but not overly so if only the whole this game was built with dlc in mind fiasco wasnt a thing then i could recommend this game just wait for a sale if there is still a playerbase,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,lobby simulator 2015 gets old very quick ridiculously over priced theres nothing really more to say edit forgot to say dlc xd,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,update 7102016 lmao they are literally giving it away well now it finally costs what its actually worth still wish i could get my 60oh well update 1282015 came by this page to see if anythings changed with this game 200 of dlcs smd end update 22815 so to recap gameplay aint awful can be compared to other good f2p formats no story or sp other than mp ai battles yawn i stand by my earlier review and to even further show how gamers are being robbed the next 4 hunters are each 7 and the behemoth monster being 15 hmmmm i could have sworn i already gave them 60 for 34 of a completed game of course you can spend 25 on the hunters pass for a minor savings instead of buying each seprately but is it even worth it overall the game looked better than it plays and costs more than its worth and the steam community as a whole reflects this trend httpsteamchartscomapp273350all whether the majority stopped playing because the price wasnt worth it or the gameplay wasnt worth it there is no disputing that this game is sinking and again f you take two and 2k for 34 assing this game and then expecting us to continue to pay and play in the long run im not even going to bother suggesting how to save this because it is no longer worth it save your money buy a different game at this point i think its clear that there is only one problem and it has nothing to do with graphics gameplay or content ill put it in bold so maybe take two and 2k will read it even though we know they wont and the countless other comments that all say the same thing you are charging robbing us 5999 for the game thats understandable but 499 for the cheapest skins wtf 749 for each additional hunter wtf 1499 for each additional monster wtf 2499 for the hunting pass 3 skins 4 additional hunters for in your words one low price f you if your going to screw us at least take note from call of duty and buy us dinner first you greedy a m f change your business pratice or become a footnote of a game that only sells when it goes on sale 5 years from now,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,dlc on day 1 in unforgivable period dlc based cash cow claims to be good competitive but its just a casual game 60 for 23rds the content of a 2530 dollar game playing as hunter chasing simulator for the first 210 minutes then its hope pug people understand their role playing as monster run armour up fight carefully if failed to win find a spot to lv up and repeat wraith seems quite broken crazy burst super mobile hard to track hard to punish and has a low cd ability that creates a clone that does high damage and the real wraith becomes invisible for quite some time lazarus seems quite broken he can rez even completely dead bodies every 10 or so seconds and do it out of stealth every 30 or so seconds and it doesnt even leave a strike the laz will just hide a mile away until people die then stealth in and rez them if he used laz device on a dead body it should add a strike but if he uses it on someone in last stand it shouldnt imo also when he takes damage in stealth it should reveal him much longer imo daisy seems ez mode just follow the doggy and find the monster whos hiding seems to mostly negate sneak strats the best thing to do as monster is just run few things take real mechanical skill in this game aiming is easy because monsters are big playing the monster isnt as challenging as id hope my only monster losses came from being forces to play it when i wanted to learn the game playing hunter and not knowing how to play kraken though i got forced into a losing game as kraken for example id rather there be 2 maps than 9 or what ever the game has honestly no map stands out its just more to learn and annoying the mm system is terrible you set what role you prefer from most preffered to least then when you search it trys to get your preffered roles first i was under the impression that you would queue up for medic then get medic 100 of the time or monster etc the lobby system is annoying and takes too long to get a game going or finish a match i wish it was in and out takes about as long as ranked in league to start a game and even more time when it ends trapper can run through tunnels and spamming harpoons in front of them virtually ensuring theyre impossible to catch so long as he has a good headset to know when youre trying to outplay him by cutting him off summary massively overhyped game thats worth about 30 dollars imo for all 3 sets of huntersmonsters but you pay 60 for only 2 sets and the dlc for the 3rd set is way over priced around 25 i think but see for yourself please dont make the mistake of giving this greedy scam company money like i did,-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,rip evolve 20152015 i prepurchased this game i was so excited about it there was no refund policy at the time otherwise i wouldve definitely asked for one 60 for this petty amount of content seriously with overpriced dlcs 2k also lowered the base price down to 40 in august basically screwing everyone who bought the game for 60 now ive got 16 hours on it so a refund wouldnt work for me so im stuck with this dead overpriced game i just launched it today and i got two bots among my teammates steamcharts numbers speak for themselves httpsteamchartscomapp273350 i regret buying this game upd its also ing broken its been a long match that ended with this httpiimgurcomapidjlxjpg anyone who defends turtle rock should read this httpstalkturtlerockstudioscomtconnectiontohosthastimedout39941 gtfebruary 2015 gtstill not fixed,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,awhile ago i said there can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love brothers and sisters there is no love to be had here only mountains of dlc that no man can climb up without a mountain of green dollars our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter and this encroachment of paid features in a sixty dollar videogame matters maybe one day without 2k ea and their ilk there will be a time where we are free from the shackles of dlc and microtransactions in our favorite hobby and on that day our nasally and out of tune choir will shout to the high heavens free at last free at last thank gaben almighty we are free at last,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,hey we didnt make enough money with our atrocious 120 preorders and 2 season passes now we remove all your progress and make the game freetoplay with microtransactions how about that the worst marketing ever seen in game industry combined with tedious gameplay and empty servers ruined the promising concept completely and after the few loyal to the game learned how to get some enjoyment out of it developers evolved to stage 2 and by evolved i mean they completely destroyed the good that was in the original i understand why developers changed distribution model and im not against it but stage 2 is not even half as good as the original game and evolve wasnt good enough to begin with hence freetoplay also theyve deleted all achievements this is an outrage how was that necessary removing the price tag was too simple for them or making a separate freetoplay product we need to do something before this thing gets to stage 3,-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this game is the most depressing thing ive ever seen its a brilliant idea by a brilliant developer ruined by the complete s controlling the dlc im extremely conflicted on one hand i want to support the idea nad turtle rock but on the other hand its a hollow shell of a game thats sold one jigsaw piece at a time to give you options as oppose to giving it to you or hell id be alright with that if a single monster doesnt cost 15 per and 7 per hunter cause thats too damn much you wanna make me buy a load of in your game after ive bought your game for 35 you better make it damn cheap there are loads of examples of games were you can buy dlc that isnt terribly priced many like dota hearthstone that are free in the first place if they un the dlc or they bring out a game of the year edition then buy it i support that and then some and ill buy it on the spot but until then i beg you dont buy this game and instead complain about it on every forum you can find until 2k decide to pull their finger out and fix the dlc i blame every problem i have with this game firmly on 2k,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,honestly i have never really felt this ripped off by a game great concept stupid price and little content a little too rinse and repeate for me cant see this having a ton of staying power played a couple game and already felt like i was done also the skins are just recolours just a colour change not worth your money and kind of a slap in the face i was expecting the skin to look quite a bitcompletely different,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i wanted to like this game i wanted to like it so much that i spent 80 bucks on it a month after release nobodys playing it and especially nobodys playing monster the game is so difficult to balance that they cant do it and why would they when everyone who will pay for the game already has theyve released the new characters and theyre completely overpowering theyll fix it eventually but the disparity is too broad either they make it easy enough for the monster to hide in which case the monster crushes the hunters or the other way around theres just too much to balance and not enough people playing i wish people would play and justify the money that i spent on this game but its never going to happen dont buy evolve,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,the game itself is a fun game if you are a fan of l4d then this game is probably for you as far as content this game is very simplistic like l4d was but there is also no option of using the community content if the game allowed community content the company couldnt nickel and dime you like they are doing here i have been following this game for a long time now and i am sad to say you should wait to buy this until there is the inevitable goty addition with all the content and at a fair price i am with the public on this and do not recommend this game due to the dlc practices day 1 dlc is never acceptable no matter how little it matters the dlc model they chose to go with may or may not hurt them but i cannot recommend a 60 game that charges so much for so little even with the pcmr edition at 100 you dont get all content,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i will try to be brief should you buy the game right now no should you buy it when its on sale yes maybe lets go over the pros first 1 visually the game looks decent 2 the gameplay is more or less fun when you finally catch up to the monster it can get pretty frantic and fun when you are searching for the monster thats where it becomes dull and boring after 49h over the past 2 days i cought myself thinking can i have some action please when we were searching for the monster for 3 minutes streight yet again and daisy was going back and forth in one sport without any indication whether she cought the tracks or the scent 3 the character banter can get interesting well thats about it proswise i am not a big fan of playing as the monster although i do admit that it is more thrilling and some pople might enjoy that aspect of the game way more than playing as the hunter being a monster is a tenser experience youre constantly on the move constantly looking for food and trying to figure out how much time to feed you have before you have to run and then where is the perfect spot to evolve cons 1 the content the content in this game is minimalistic there is a short campaign which is basically 5rounds of various modes you can beat it in around 40ish minutes and thats it theres scarsly any story and i just can hope that turtle rock will eventually release additional campaign chapters that will make it more interesting other than that you are getting 16 maps 3 monster characters 4 hunter classes with 3 characters per class you cant customise your characters beying the perk that you select before the round begins or the skins that you buy from the shop but well get to that later evolve claims to be an aaa title yet given the content that is avaiable in this 60 game i cant really agree with this claim a stale series such as cod usually offers you a full campaign aka story mode multiplayer with a dozen of maps a fair ammount of customisation for your character bf does the same alternatively games like wolfenstein tno or bioshock offer you an immersive world with a strong story and a overall a memorable experience and i cant really say that evolve offers any of that what it does offer if is a shop to go and buy tons of dlcs 2 dlcs there is a lot of day one dlc content that 2k is trying to sell you for additional fee in fact the shop looks like something that belongs in a f2p game some people defend the game buy saying well you dont have to buy this content it doesnt affect the gameplay and even gw2 wot and dota 2 have shops a the fact that i dont have to buy all that content doesnt change the high probability that at some point this content was part of the base game the sheer amount of it indicates that the customisation option is an innate part of the game and at some point it was likely indluced in the game without the shop ripping contnet from the base game with intent to sell it on top for a 60 price tag when the game on its own is already a barebones product that doesnt shiny with an overwhelming ammount of conent to being with is just a poor sales practice b a comparison with likes of gw2 is also innacurate because gw2 albeit a beast from different genre had tons of content in the base game something that evolve with its 16 sameylooking maps cant boast c wot and dota 2 and other f2p games dont require you to ponnyout 60 just to get in to the game so its only natural that those games will have shop finally 2ks argument that allegeldy without that shop and ton of dlcs the game wouldnt be able to exist is doubvious at best when you see other aaatitles brinning more content for the same 60,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i played the alpha whatever thingy and i will prefence this by saying i didnt much care for l4d2 and ill get to why that matters in a second but what i want to say goes beyond the bugs and load times and connection and preformance problems that are in a lot of alphas which were rampant in this one i want to talk about the core of this game so here goes i do not like this game at its core what it is is very shallow which is not the problem but how it is executed is the problem for me atleast the premise is very simple 4 hunters 1 monster trapped in a jungle who will win but what this leads to is a bunch of tedious running lets explain how the monsters work and what is truly wrong about this game to me the monster works like this you spawn in at stage 1 you can either kill all the hunters or destroy a power relay to win but when you start you are generally to weak to kill them but there are 2 more stages which you can get to by feeding on weaker creatures in the jungle stage 2 for most monsters you are an even match and can win most fights if done correctly stage 3 you are an overpowered killing machine and unstoppable they could tweek the monsters to balance them so thats not what i really want to get at the heart of my problem is the complete lack of variance in how you play a monster from stage to stage and how they change the abilities of a monster stage to stage and what i want to address are things i believe they will not change in the full release you only become more powerful from stage to stage there is no trade there is no cause and effect there is absolutely no reason not to hide and run until you get to stage 3 there is no thought to making the monster complex or thought of incentivising stages which means you spend almost every match running from spot to spot trying to catch up to something thats just as fast as you and can scale cliffs faster than you and can cover its track almost completely now for the l4d2 comparison the reason i didnt like that game is similar to why i dont like this and wouldnt you know it the same people made both both games make a huge emphasis on the maps you play on not what you do on them they spread and spiral but theres not really much substance you run and run but you really get no where both games use this long slog through nothing to create the illusion of accomplishment when really you just spent 20 minutes with sub par combat on a sub par map running thats all you do none of the guns in either game feel particularly good and both games are entirely dependent on having a full team of people who know exactly what they are doing for it to work at all which lets be honest doesnt happen a lot of the time in any online multiplayer if youre not playing with friends that is which means that this game like l4d2 will be relagated to friend only play for a lot of people which for the love of god take into consideration before blowing 60 on this game i am not by any stretch of the imagination saying this game is terrible i am not even saying dont ever buy it but what i am saying is dont hype buy this game is to me one of those games that is only as fun as you make it and considering there are a lot of games that will give you fun coop play at a much lower price then why drop 60 on this i feel that like titan fall this games hype will be short lived as people slowly realize this game has as much substance as a glass of water now i think mindlessly criticizing is pointless if you do not have a clear idea what you want and what would make the game better you are basiclly just being a picky child who stubbornly refuses to eat his vegatables so id like to speak my peace on that front there are many things they could do even now that would push the game towards what id want i just dont think theyll do any of them even now they could completely get rid of the power relay the relay is pointless and slows possible combat with the monster why push the pace now when you can get to stage 3 and force them to meet you when you are more powerful than them i mean think about it imagne theres no relay the monsters at stage 3 now he actually has to hunt the hunters it would completely flip the dynamics on there head and make the game more interesting keep the stupid relay but make it physically impossible for stage 3 monsters to get to it meaning you can only attack the relay at stage 1 and 2 and making the desicion to go to stage 3 a risk reward decision where you have to find and kill the hunters another thing if oh no the magical relay to import to get rid of greatly reduce the speed and mobility of stage 3 monsters at this point its just ing stupid you just stand no chance againt a stage 3 monster with the relays if he gets to stage 3 youve already lost you just have to sit there and watch him destroy the relay and die what i really want which is albeit a lot harder at this point because theyve already kind of commited to monsters and their design give me a real reason to stay in stage 1 and 2 i mean the lack of thought in this what id consider the most important part of the game is kind of shamful on their part but this is how i believe the monster should be built and funnily enough it utilizes some l4d2 elements to me stage 1 should be all about stealth shush moron and read on because what the game does now is not that and not what i mean i mean stealth in the true sense i do not believe stage 1 monster should leave foot prints or be able to be trapped in the bubble and should be able to cloak and have a move akin to the jocky in l4d2 which would also cut off in game mic now is that not more intersting than running and eating things having the ability to watch and hide and wait for someone to lag behind then strike to have an actual reason to stay for atleast a period of time in stage 1 stage 2 id say its fine the way it is for the most part a balanced fight good mix of power and speed both sides should have a chance of winning a head on fight stage 3 should have some sort or negatives to the massive power increase there needs to be pros and cons not having them makes it pointless for hunters to play when the monster hits stage 3 why not just quit its like playing monoploy for another 3 hours after you had to mortgage every property but one whats the point and people will just start quiting out when monsters hit stage 3 if its not balanced which will ruin all the weirdos fun who love this game the way it is only because they have some kind of power trip which trust me other people will not indulge for long but i mean honestly i do not understand the point of different mosters at all it should be 1 monster with a great verity of branching paths making multiple monsters just narrows what you can do in a single match which also makes the game boring because from the word go you know exactly where its going where if there were only one monster youd have no idea what to expect each time you met the monster making it much more exciting when you met i mean it is called evovle right why cant one monster evolve into all of the bull crap monsters they are making why can i not see how the people im up against play first and then deside what kind of monster i want just a thought i mean the reason im writing this is because i heard the hype and i wanted it to be that good and honestly its just not its a sub par game with mountains of potential that will probably all be wasted as they get on their own hype train and ride that mofo straight to titan fall station just another sub par blip on the gaming radar oh well ps its no wonder theyre blocking reviews until full release when a 3rd of reviews are negitive,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,ignore the negativity hence what i did it actually its free to play you have nothing to lose play the game for your self and form your own opinion pros 1no dlc 2balance gamplay 3quick matchmaking 4can have a good time with friends 5 2k 6devs actually listen to player feed back behemoth was underpowerd and there buffing him alittle and wraith was overpowerd henced nerfed him 7little bugs to see 8 no in game purchases by the looks cons 1in my opininon the rounds are pretty short 2depending on your team if they dont do there job your pretty much ed but if they do then your laughing in conclusion its generally a fun game i dont know why it gets so much hate but the difference between the paid and free to play is generally the paid is more focused on hunting while free to play is more arcade but it dosent undermine the base gameplay it still the same game with minor modifications but in the end get it its fun,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i really wanted to like this game and at times i have a great deal sadly overall i cant recommend the frustration ive experienced from this game to anyone else this is not going to be one of those reviews that bashes the game because of its dlc policy abusive or not were here to talk about the game as is and frankly there is plenty of diverse content to enjoy in this game there are four character classes assault medic trapper and support and theres also the monster class each of those classes have three different characters to enjoy it with theres a medic who uses a tf 2 med gun to heal you but then theres also lazerus whos best time to heal a character is actually after they are already down or dead there are assault characters who are best up close and personal and assaulters who do their best damage at a distance there are 15 characters in all to unlock and each one plays utterly different than the other i can actually applaud the variety i can also praise matches that go perfectly there are times where you are the exact class you want for an entire evacuation match which is really 5 minimatches rolled into one big instance with a great team against a skilled monster when it comes together evolve is a lot of fun but evolve doesnt come together all that often the only way to start playing is to just enlist into a massive pool of random players and hope the game puts you into a match of your preference you rate the classes on a scale of 15 which measures how much you want to play a give class when you pick you preferences the game even promises to try and give you your top picks as often as possible total and utter bold faced lie i usually have the monster rated 5th in last he or she yes there are female monsters plays just fine and is balanced enough as long as youre pretty crafty after a long day at work where i have customers ganging up on me day and night i dont want to play a game in which a group of 4 does their best to gang up on me that is my number one preference and i have felt it ignored at every chance it could ive spent ten straight minutes joining and rejoining matches in the hopes that i wouldnt be thrown into a monster roll or a dead hunter and have quit without even playing a match there is no way to indicate that you want to start on day 1 and that you are willing to wait for a party as long as you get the position you want yes its annoying watching impatient players come and go but id rather do that than join a match as a level 1 wraith already domed and down to half health theres a way to play evolve strictly coop the monster is ai controlled at all times and this has sadly become my only option the monster ai is good but also lacking in everything you want it to have you want the monster to be like a predator from the movies giving you a mighty good chase only to lead you into a tunnel where you are bbqed by the crafty monster as he chargers threw your party like a bowling ball i won once using this strategy sadly the ai doesnt have that resourcefulness and most matches are just you following the monster from feed sight to feed sight getting in a shot here or there till it reaches level 3 what brought this review on was a repeating glitch ive been suffering from in coop where ive finally said enough is enough as stated before evacuation matches go on for 5 days and saves the best xp and accolades for the end of the 5th day ive been suffering from a glitch that for some reason ejects me from matches stating i am not signed into a profile so im not allowed to play despite the fact that im on day 3 already i am thusly ejected from the match and miss out on the xp i deserve and since there is utterly no way to have any say about which match you join youve practically just wasted your time these problems can easily be fixed with a few patches and i am genuinely intrigued as to how this game will grow depending on who wins a day the monster of the hunters the game will introduce a prowinner perk thatll change the game the hunters can get ai buddies to follow you around or portals to transport you around the level while the monster will get increased wild life more aggresive wildlife toward humans ecetera the perks sadly go away at the end of the match i cant help but feel the loss of depth imagine if they carried over throughout the campaign there could be massive amounts of angry wildlife which are bombarded with a space laser that the humans saved they need to expand evacuation possibly into an intergalatic monster war there is a terraformed moon revolving around the planet so im assuming well get up there at some point im sorry for the massive length i only wanted to get every thought out and i thank you for reading if for some reason you did i do like this game and i had some fun with it but in its current state or at its current price i cant recommend this game,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this all started when thq liquidated and trs bid their meager 250000 on the evolve ip and 2k outbid them with 11000000 it doesnt paint a pretty picture that 2k outbid the original devs so absurdly drove the game into the ground and then booted the devs out the second their contract ended,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,before the game is even out a 25 of the playable monsters are locked away as dlc everyone buying and playing this is mentally ill,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,great game but no players why you may ask simple the developers decided to charge for everything this seriously had the gameplay to go places but with a horrible payment model the player base shrank until it could no longer be seen,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,update 2016 jul 12 came back to see if the game had improved with the ftp it has not the game didnt have much to it before and most of the things that made it unique and occationally entertaining have been removed or dulled signifigantly the game has gone from a series of hunts which were occcationally tricky to a rather dull multi stage fps my main problem with the game originally was that when you knew where the monster was it was usually a extended game of follow the leader with the hunters trying to catch the faster monster that hasnt changed all theyve done is remove the interconnected missions and the need to actually find the monster cant believe im saying this but the games actually less fun than before devs really should have spent more time trying to make the core mechanics better than rushing this into ftp update 2015 mar 26 with the new hunters coming in i wanted to see if the updates since launch had improved the game play at all sadly they have not the game still feels like an extended game of tag where the hunters try to catch a monster then immediately switch roles and try to avoid the monster or face getting chain stunned to death it never feels like your hunting the monster tracks and sign are easy for anyone to follow most of the game is spent chasing the much faster monsters there is the occasional chance to cut off a monster but experienced players minimize these opportunities the thing i find most frustrating is that it never feels like theres a balance and the devs really dont know how to fix it in the latest patch one of the characters i enjoyed playing cabot received around a 50 nerf to his damage he may have been slightly overpowered before but a nerf that large screams lack of pretesting or extreme overreaction as much as i want to enjoy evolve i just find it an exercise in frustration ive only been able to stand for a game or two during events in order to unlock the rewards before i want to play something else still wish i passed on it at this point original review i was looking forward to playing evolve last night but was seriously frustrated by a lot of the functionality in game you cannot skip the initial tutorial or any video the characters are all introduced this way but their skills are simple for the most part and could be introduced by a static graphic instead every player needs to sit around for 2 minutes while these videos play i was so frustrated at one point i actually altf4d out of the game in frustration just so i could skip one of the lengthy videos in addition you need to score your favored classes theres no option to not play a class i had no desire to play the monster or assault last night but was stuck with them on multiple occasions this included being selected for the monster in back to back games in a campaign which caused me to drop out in frustration evolve has been compared to l4ds asymmetric gameplay but its a poor comparison l4d built tension with tight areas harassed the survivors with npcs and provided the infected interesting ways to disrupt theres no tension here the neutral mobs only exist to provide a temporary buffs food for the monster or a minor annoyance i think the most frustrating part is theres very little incentive for the monster to engage until its ready this might be interesting gameplay for the monster but it means that all the hunters are doing is trying to catch upcut off the monster for 12 big fights that means in a 10 minute game all the hunters are doing for 78 minutes is running around the map i cant say the fights are particularly engaging either most of the monster attacks cause a fair amount of knockback and most of the ccdeployables the hunters have can be instantly broken by a basic attack as a result all the hunters are doing is trying to avoid drawing the monsters attention with the primary target being thrown around and ccd to death with very little chance of evading the game may grow on me but it wasnt worth the cost imo note the problem most people have is with the amount of dlc although i didnt have a problem when they announced the packages since they were being upfront i was disappointed to see a truck load of day 1 pay dlc not included i stopped buying games from ea because of their practice of launching day 1 and microtransaction dlc on full games i will no longer be supporting 2k games after this,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,game that was supposed to be a f2p title with microtransactions turned into a 60 title with an overload of dlc dont believe that watch this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdsi7wfdjojo,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,dont support this business practice,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,you 2k and your dlc t basegame 4999 all additional content right after release 8088 go die in fire please you already killed the borderlands series for me with this cancer about the game,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,a game so dead even an necromancer wouldnt touch it,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,not worth the price and the community is rather unpleasant last i checked,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this is an alpha amp beta review that means it is subject to change at the time of the official product release evolve was iconic at e3 it delivered cuttingedge visuals with immersive gameplay it also introduced a style of gameplay that has not been ventured into much by other developers at e3 evolve was the next big thing it was the successor to valves immensly popular left4dead franchise but did it deliver its intended effect no the visuals are stunning the physics are wicked the concept is good and the mouse optimization along with changing the color scheme on the mouse when you play as different classes is the neatest thing i could ever imagine a game would have though i was slightly confused initially as i did not know the game could do that then what went wrong the core gameplay the core gameplay lacked most of the elements which make a game worth playing throwing in millions of dollars and thousands of hours of development to introduce nifty elements to the game failed to mask its complete failure at entertaining the player in my five hours ingame i chased a raving leaping lunatic monkey relentlessly occassionally cornering it and killing it however the amount of time spent in chasing the said monkey was so high that it was not worth the kill the hunters were disabled by the fact that the monster moved significantly faster than them and could easily elude them even at close ranges occasionally we spent nearly threequarters of an hour searching for a monster that switched positions from corner to corner of the map making it impossible for hunters to intercept or even reach remotely near did you want to wait instead and set a trap for the monster near the power relay and kill him once he arrived there as a stage 3 beast too bad he had full armor at that stage his hits dealt 3x damage and the power relay had very little health trapping the monster in a portable dome didnt help either because hed lunge around the dome till it ran out and escape leaving you chasing him for another halfhour additionally to the monsters advantage there was no time limit on how long each round would take so the monster could eat and elude at his leisure and take his sweet time destroying the power relay lastly the fov of the game felt slightly absurd and personally for me induced mild motion sickness so thats a disclaimer for anyone wishing to try the game by the end the game made me feel as bitter as this review is,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,firstly let me start by stating i love the game the design is great the characters are fun and interesting and the game modes are entertaining and challenging albeit some could do with a bit of tweaking the gameplay is great the packaging however is truly godawful even without mentioning the horrific balls up that is the dlc everything around the game is shoddy and desperate unskipable fmvs i thought we were past this kind of t that forced everyone to delete the file in their install directory matchmaking please my god dont match on experience it means nothing if i can grind xp in solo matches but am actually useless in a game against human players i wont even talk about the being unable to actually pick the class you want or the fact theres barely any penalty for leaving an inprogress game you know those people who havent lost a game its because they leave if theyre losing which brings me on to competition ranking boards that rank on wins so if i grind enough ill be top even if im truly godawful fantastic you can compete with your friends to see how many games you play any form of serious ranking would be a godsend even just an automatic loss for quitting an improgress game game finding no i dont want to join a game as the monster where hes 2 bars from death and stuck in an arena no i dont want to join a game where im in a team of complete ai against a human thats what solo is for game choice i fancy a nice nest game oh no sorry you have to play a full 5 round game to have a good shot of getting one of those games but its ok your team mates will probably leave if you lose a round so its back to solo dlc because obligatory corporate moneygrabbing is what all the cool kids are doing tldr great gameplay wrapping even publishing unless they do some serious reworking i wouldnt recommend it,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,monster killed everyone but the support support called airstrike on himself to kill himself and the monster it worked we listened to dont want to miss a thing after in his honor turned the song off after two seconds cause the song sucks tears were shed his daughter now knows he loves her,1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,fun game ruined by dlc avoid,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,just not worth the price maybe 2530,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,heartbroken by the decision of 2k to stop production of the game the game had great potential the concept of 4 hunters trapper medic assault support each with a different role and each with unique abilities trying to hunt a monster before it gets too strong to kill a monster that is weak in the beginning having to hunt amp consume wildlife to evolve and grow stronger strong enough to destroy a generator defended by the hunters or kill all of the hunters before the time runs out i bought the game before it was free to play and i still think its worth every cent but the decision of 2k to fire turtlerock studios effectively shutting down production of the game left me genuinely devastated i first heard this news from the youtuber grizzlemarine and he was quite upset and i get that even going as far as to create a petition to try and get the game to be available in console when you follow a game from the beginning watching how much the game grew and how the awesome developers were at constantly fixing bugs and introducing new characters and monsters just to have it suddenly end like thisit just doesnt seem right the devs were awesome at their jobs and its just really unfair for them im sure the true fans of evolve will still come back to this game but we all know it wont be the same rip evolve,1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,great game that is a total blast to play to expensive for what you get 60 plus 25 pass wait for a sale a good one,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,one giant monster four hunters hunters chase monster and if the game goes on long enough monster chases hunters sort of the game changes the objective of the hunters to defend a point when the monster hits stage 3 of evolution which should really be called the the hunters so hard stage all in all that is the entirety of the game a game that costs 60 usd and doesnt really deserve to is it fun sort of between in game voice chat bugs a cursor that just wont quit in game and a sense of general balance issues here and there the game has a lot of problems the core idea of the game is a good one and has potential to be fun killing floor and orion prelude have similar ideas and both are a hell of a time however this game has more problems than good to it right now a problem that i cant say for certain will be fixed as far as the ludicrous dlc amounts look no further than the 9999 usd pc monster race pack that gives a fifth playable monster two aditional hunters and four monster skins it also includes the base game but that is a lot for release day dlc in a game that lacks as much content even when compared to free to play mmorpgs by aria games somewhat legendary in their lack of content in games and even worse when compared to the often times 1 orion prelude where at least you can enjoy the sensation of killing dinosaurs across more maps bare in mind that the fact that it costs 60 base they are asking 40 for the privelage to play an entire monster type and two hunters if you like me bought this game i am sorry but at least you werent the only one and assuming the bugs get worked out it can even be considered a good time i will still be playing it occasionally if for no other reason than a boost to my own self esteem a desperate ploy to make me feel like i did not waste my money if you were lucky enough not to dont wait on it and see if this game becomes worth the 60 price tag or not,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this is a game about buying dlc as the game consists in trying to endure and justify the 60 bucks you spent in an incomplete game that 2k and turtle rock claim to be 100 dollars,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,left for dead titanfall devolve pricing model is truly disgusting not to mention all the dlcs day one dlc 15 monsters 750 characters 2k games are milking us gamers dry,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,just in case dont blame turtle tock studios they didnt have the choice to continue supporting this game it was 2k decision,1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmotvp6tamn4 trs made a game 2k ruined it edit to all who defend and support greedy publishers and are fine with their lies httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvoayf8ecqse,-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,evolve i dont even know where to start well lets start at the beginning i started playing when the game was in beta i was so hyped for this game i did not play anything else showed it off to everyone because it simply was awesome and it still dont get me wrong but the game has changed over the time in a way that it broke my heart first off the game died fairly fast you really noticed how it took longer and longer to get a game so lets get to my usualy review form positive the graphics are good the perfomance is alright this game is a very strategic game even though it is 4vs1 you need to stay coordinated there are lots of maps and neutral monster which can change the end of the game negative the devs do not care about anything happening in this game reports players or bugs balancing issues or even plain communication as already mentioned the game is pretty dead there are a lot of buggs in this game there is a low supply on content in this game and when there is you need to pay for it microtransactions do not get me started there are a lot of new characters which all cost around 5 maybe which is unreasonably overpriced for a game that costed 60 i really tried my best here i have put quite some time in the beta and in this game i never stopped coming back hoping for the day where everything will be good again this day apparently never came if the game would not be as dead as it is i would recommend it to new players but since this is not the case you will just waste your money here conclusion i can only agree to the other reviews saying that game was nice but it went down on quality drasticly the game had an uniqe aspect there were not many games like this out and it was something new something that a lot of people loved but the devs decided to ruin that do not buy this game its not worth itanymore,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i didnt manage to play it during alpha but i was extremely looking forward to this game then the preorders started happening preorder bonus of l4d who doesnt have l4d by now since it was free awhile ago that isnt even the main issue the issue is the fact that it is horrendously overpriced theres no debating that this game is overpriced its a 60 dollar game that heavily relies on the mp aspect and the community on top of that the dlc is ridiculous 20 dollars just for 3 playable characters i would definitely wait for the inevitable goty sale however by then the game will have most likely died and thered be no reason to pick up the game since the game relies too much on mp i have no doubt this game is fun and amazing but the fact that its overpriced at 60 dollars 100 dollars for the full experience while completly relying on mp just makes me do a full 180,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,nothing like day one dlc and 99 pay wall for every monster in an unfinished game amiright,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,fun game thats ruined by day one dlc and bad business models do not buy this game it is not worth the cost we have to show the industry that we wont settle for this crap,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,fun level 4 players vs night hunter in dying light gt 4 players vs monsterwho just always have to run and evolve in evolve,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,game is great solid gameplay good graphics amazing ambience highly addicting and a top tier strategic team based game for the hunters that is evolve can be an amazing game except for the fact its payment model which will be the inevitable downfall of this game also the amount of content for the price is not exactly what i consider a good deal rather the polar opposite of that save your money for now unless the devs fix their dlc model also this is what you get for paying the minimal amount for the base game gt12 maps gt3 monsters gt12 hunters gt4 game modes rescue defend hunt or nest evac is just a combination of those 4 modes not a new game mode gtingame cash shop to me this is not much content for a game priced at 60 minimum on steam,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i wish 2k dump battleborn support instead it has less players than evolve,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,not enough content to justify the current price and ludicrous amounts of excessively overpriced dlc we need to show todays developers that shady business practices such as this will not be tolerated do not buy this game,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,ffter f2p f2p model fixed low amount of players issue there are still old and new problems about the game poor matchmaking despite of 2050k people playing matchmaking system still cant guarantee fair teams you can get really newbie hunters against you and snowball them at stage 1 or you can get elite premade team who will do flawless victory rarely you can see something close to fair matchmaking disbalance okeyokey many games have it and dont care but really some monsters are too strong and some hunters are really useless playing dozen hours i found out that there are actually few popular sets in terms of hunters team bugs you still can stuck yeah playing a monster you still can stuck even after 2 years they couldnt fix it but lets cosider you move carefully moving system buggy by itself how do you like losing your ranking point after actually winning ranking match such bugs are so motivating poor gameplay one game mode is actually boring to play again and again after checking different monsters and hunters you find yourself doing the same stuff constantly running the same way shooting the same target etc this game really misses variety before f2p i would not recommend this game because of dead mp i tried the game free weekend time and there were 4k players online only it took more time to get team ready than match lasted for example 12 minutes of waiting and 8 minutes for a match poor matchmaking you can take low level players versus expirienced monster and vice versa i got into matches that last 15 mitutes only because of monster had no idea what to do and on the other hand i played with people who dont understand how to play vs incredibly elusive monster disbalance lvl 3 monsters look overpowered there are monsters that can be invisible or can fly so you cant really touch them do you want another monster or hunter please pay more poor gameplay you either look for monster to trap and kill it or you run away as a monster to eat and killemall in hunt mode there are 4 game modes at time when i write it but i cant check and enjoy them all because of dead mp price really even with 50 discount i will never buy such game thanks to free weekend keep in mind dlcs prices too,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,i loved the alpha i really loved the beta with my friends do u really think im a tard i hate those season pass or everything back in the day we buy a game and we have free updates now a game like evolve charge u on day one with the game plus a dlc,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,over priced game feels the same each round nothing but a grind fest on a single repetitive mode not worth the money at all especially with more overpriced dlc coming 1499 or something for a character monster worst overpriced dlc ever not bought the game alphabeta has let me review the game,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,evolve is the recent game to be added to turtle rock studios small collection of games most known for their development of left 4 dead and left 4 dead 2 they have yet again tried something new with the development of evolve this game carries a lot of controversy mainly in regards to the price range i agree with the concerns of the price point of this game and the amount of content you get for such a price do i believe the game is worth 6000 no plus the additional editions which can raise the price up to 20 dollars or even an additional 40 dollars no you might be wondering what turtle rock studios is offering you for such a price let me go ahead and tell you what you get for 6000 youll get the base game nothing less nothing more 12 characters four game modes and three monsters preordering the game gave you a copy of left 4 dead and magma skins for the monsters 8000 got you the evolve digital deluxe edition this includes the base game plus the evolve hunting season pass which includes four new hunters at a future date 10000 gets you the evolve pc monster race edition this includes the base game the season pass a fifth playable monster called the behemoth at a future date the magma skins as well as the four new characters i do not believe that this comes with all of the optional skins it may or may not whether or not youre willing to spend that much for the items i just listed is up to you for me it isnt enough i believe that the behemoth is a ploy to keep you from trading away the game gameplaywise how is the game well the gameplay of evolve is tense and very smooth the characters are very easy to control as well as use although some of the characters are harder to use than others everyone has the skills necessary to learn and perfect a class with a little time and effort the game does come with a tutorial for every hunter and monster that you unlock this makes it easier for you to understand how to play a match with your characters the ai has been drastically increased from that of left 4 dead when playing evacuation mode you have the option to play with a group of four other players against an ai controlled monster or four players against a human controlled monster the ai controlled monster is pretty much hard mode as it does target those important hunters first making the coordination of your team crucial without communication in this game youre doomed to fail by default you can ping with the q button this will make a ping noise and mark in the area where your crosshair is pointed a necessary tool for those with and without communication although microphones are always best this game is better played with a group of friends as opposed to random players but what about the actual hunters and monsters is there any point to upgrading yes as stated earlier the base game gives you 12 hunters and 3 monsters listed below each of the hunters have flaws and unique abilities that make them special medic class val first lazarus second caira third support class hank first bucket second cabot third trapper class maggie amp daisy first griffin second abe third assault class markov first hyde second parnell third monster class goliath first kraken second wraith third the game modes consist of the regular hunt mode survivor rescue defend and nest hunt goal hunters vs monster monster must reach level 3 in order to destroy the relay or kill the hunters hunters must kill the monster rescue goal hunters must rescue and escort the survivors to an extraction point the monster must kill a certain amount of survivors or kill the hunters nest goal hunters must destroy a certain amount of eggs before the monster is able to hatch or kill the hunters defend goal the monster must destroy all three of the hunters generators before the time reaches 0 the hunters must defend their generator until the time limit is up or kill the monster my personal feelings for the modes are below hunt fun fair cat and mouse mode nest huntersided if you have a team that knows what theyre doing rescue fair as long as the monster isnt an idiot defend monstersided the monster has respawning minons every 30 seconds and the hunters generators cannot regenerate power what about the gameplay what can this game possibly offer to make you continously interested well people are right to have fears about being bored of this game after several hours of gameplay it really is the same thing over and over again and it does get boring i didnt expect to get bored of this game so soon but i did there are several mechanics in this game that just make me believe this game is a cashin from turtle rock studios day one dlc skins why for a game that is 60 dollars there must be some sort of replayability right wrong the replayability that comes with this game eventually turns into a grind to get elite status for a character this begins a series of questions for the terrible matchmaking here are a series of issues i have with the game to sum up this review 1 why are we restricted from filtering out certain monsters from a server not everyone wants to play against a certain type of monster in my scenario and almost anyone elses wraith its such a lame monster high damage and high evading capabilities its also a real to track making the match a grind and forcing people to resort to abandoning a server if they are just not in the mood to go through the process 2 why are we restricted from having a party member be allowed to be the monster if your worries pertain to something along the lines of well you can sit there and grind elites with your friends and cheat experience then thats invalid youre able to create a customized match and set the map settings to pretty in depth settings the thing about these customized servers that only your party can join is that you can still gain regular experience and character progression so if you need 900 direct hits with parnells rocket launcher to reach your elite skin no worries just grab a buddy set the game to monster favored set the strikes to 0 and have him kill your ai partners once done feel free to hammer away and exploit the games elite skin game design 3 why is our only means of customization through the elite skins yes i get that you can purchase weapon skins and a couple skins for the monsters but why why isnt something like that already in the game for turtle rock studios to hold the behemoth and extra four hunters until a later date youd want to be continously interested in the game you wouldnt want to get bored so fast into to the game sure there are perks that you unlock as you get further into levels you can also customize a badge with little pieces and different colors as you progress through levels but that kind of stuff doesnt give me something to work for i dont log into a game and say yes i cant wait to play all day and unlock this particular badge piece id want to sit there and randomly stumble upon different skins and such 4 why do the characters feel so limited as to what they could do they should at least have different loadouts in which you can fool around with it really makes the game feel empty val only gets this and that markov only gets that and that theres no mixing up their weapons with other class specific items im not saying have markov have the ability to use parnells super soldier or shotgun give each hunter unique skills that they can reassign and fool around with 5 what is so hard about making an efficient matchmaking system many other game devs have been able to pull off a decent matchmaking server im tired of having monster so far away from first place and the game constantly makes me the monster,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,there isnt enough content to justify the games price and on top of that they are selling day one dlcs and have microtransactions in the game if it was f2p that would be ok but its 60 minimum disgusting,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,evolve is really fun for about two hours but for a full price aaa title evolve is so vastly lacking in content diversity strategic depth and general charisma the games biggest problem is its formulaic nature there is one way every hunt match plays out the monster tries to avoid combat until it evolves to level 3 the hunters try to find the monster before it can evolve this is the game unlike other games that allow for perhaps an early sneak attack zerg rush or unorthodox strategies evolve only allows for one way of play you will conform or you will lose apart from the signature hunt mode the campaign mode takes about a hour to finish this mode could have been pretty interesting with a real story and meaningful choices rather it is just a string of 5 matches in a row with lip service to story think titanfalls campaign but somehow worse the other game modes are very slight variations on hunt that clearly were thrown together without much thought rescue in particular is so very poorly balanced with the monster given competing goals of trying to evolve but also forced to immediately attack the hunters this game could have been so much more there is so much potential in the concept it took turtle rock years just to come up with a barebones experience with formulaic matches the unlock progression system is also of the extremely grindy variant that gives mathematical advantages to obsessive players and discourages new players then theres the day one dlc and ingame dlc store despite asking full price up front an abomination in conclusion when call of duty has the decency to give us a full 10 hour sp campaign a distinct coop mode and a fullfledged mp mode evolves one gimmick game design just doesnt stand up to the competition but hey those first two hours were fun,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,too laggy too little replayability too expensive,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,the game that broke my heart twice,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,everyone says the price isnt worth the gameand they are right the amount of features you get for the large price tag for just the basic game is ridiculousness then add on that the extra for the dlc this game should be either a 50 tops or a free to play game however the price of the game does not define if its good or notas much as i would love to say everyone come buy this game they really shouldnt here is why gui bugs while these are not game breaking it is a royal pain in the as you will face having a mouse cursor while you run around as a hunter and no mouse at all when you are in menus making it hard to change classes and perks monsters although it is clear that monsters are supposed to be powerful the biggest issue is that two of them wraith and kraken have such an easy time running away from the hunters so that they can ignore stealth almost altogether in favour of simply running away so unless your trapper is a class and you have a team with great teamwork in a public game what are the chances of that you simply wont catch them or catch them long enough until they are rank3 and have no issue taking out your party humans a couple of hunters have issues that should have been picked up in beta but for some reason they got ignored for example cabot main character i play his rail gun is supposed to shoot through walls to hit the monster yet what they dont say is that it only seems to work if the monster is pressed up against the wall you are shooting into not only that but for a rail gun you would assume that the weapon would have no range limitations however it seems that it does making it frustrating hyde for some reason was given a grenade that is supposed to cause a puff of toxic smoke to hurt the monster if it stays in place not only does it do such a little amount of damage its a pain to rank up other plays will hate you for it because the visibility issues it gives the other hunters makes it more of a disadvantage then advantage there are more but i am trying to save on boring anyone kind enough to read this long and the short of itthis game would be good fun with a group of friends playing with mics having a few beers making it worth the bugs and the oddities with the game but in random public games it just isnt worth your time or your money until they fix what they should have fixed in the beta,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,yeah 100 dollars for dlc totally make sense,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,evolve is a disappointment and i dont say that because the game is a catastrophe quite the opposite the game is a disappointment because so much effort was put into making a game that could be so much better im writing this review a little more than a month into 2016 and the community was on life support well over 6 months ago im going to start off with whats great about the game its easy to learn but theres room for mastery this has its costs and benefits the obvious benefit is that the game is accessible to newer players but this isnt to disparage other games with massive skill curves initial hurdles like that can allow for beautifully complex gameplay but thankfully evolve doesnt shoehorn in complexity where none is necessary or enjoyable the monster and hunters each have a short set of weapons that fulfill unique roles instead of a multitude of tools that are largely redundant instead of trying to learn a massive list of rockpapersscissors you just need to figure out how to appropriately use the tools you have its got variety people take this for granted but the developers actually did a great job of varying the abilities of monsters the weapons and aesthetics of hunters and so on people dont complain about every hunter being the same or having the same kind of weapon or every monster having the exact same abilities but you can bet they would and rightfully so if the devs had neglected this aspect of the game maps and this goes back to the previous point to some extent evolve actually has quite a few maps enough that youll get tired of the gameplay before you ever get tired of the setpiece for that gameplay it looks pretty good graphics arent a dealbreaker but i can appreciate the immense effort that went into modelling texturing etc to make this game look good without requiring a super computer to run it just from examining the environment equipment wildlife hunters or monsters you wont conclude that the devs cut corners no to reach that conclusion youll have to actually play the game so why is the game a disappointment two reasons balance and community the latter problem the community is not technically a problem with the game itself but this is a multiplayer game and matchmaking can take quite some time so i hope youve got something to do while the game looks for a match especially if you prefer to play monster balance whats wrong with balance well all of the maps are understandably somewhat small if they were significantly larger it would essentially mean that if a monster broke line of sight long enough itd be able to escape the hunters for the whole round some maps however are extremely small broken hill foundry and are nearly unwinnable for the monster if you take wraith whose whole build is predicated on stealth and you get stuck in a map like that you are screwed sure theres some difficult choke points for the hunters but that doesnt really matter if youre a level 1 wraith with no survivability and unimpressive damage dealing abilities when i played about a year ago less than that but not by much the semicompetent monsters would usually stomp pubs but any competent team of hunters would win the vast majority of games against even competent monsters at this point it seems like any team of pubs can just stomp the monster at least the wraith at this point which has been nerfed quite significantly since i last played this is ridiculous considering the fact that competent hunters were already favored in a head to head match because if they used their abilities like sound spikes and sending track darts into prey the monster will likely eat theres no chance the monster can sneak around until they get to max strength like i sometimes used to get away with maybe the players are much better now certainly doesnt seem that way but i think monsters have been nerfed into the ground the basic reasoning by the devs being that its better to have 4 medicore players hunting the monster leave satisfied than to have 1 competent monster beat out 4 mediocre hunters who cant work together i think the problem with the devs attempts at balancing is they base their attempts at balancing off of win rates and statistics but not from actually watching gameplay if competent hunters beat competent monsters 80 of the time this would suggest to me that the game is unbalanced hypothetically if comptent monsters beat incompetent teams of hunters 80 of the time this suggests to me the obvious fact that when you have two equally powerful machines a monstervs a 4 man team of hunters and the latter machine hunters has 4 moving parts players that can fail it stands to reason that if the game is actually balanced the monster should win the majority of the time because its far more likely that one of the moving parts is faulty in the hunters team yet the devs aim towards a 50 win rate which means theyre aiming towards having monsters lose 50 of the time to a team of hunters which is 4 times more likely to contain an incompetent player the target they consider balance will be biased against the monster because they fail to recognize that a fair match between 1 monster and 4 hunters should naturally favor the 1 monster a monster doesnt need to worry about communicating with teammates or relying on them for success balancing the game off of win rates and shooting for 50 win rates will lead towards a bias against the monster random teams of hunters that dont coordinate should not have a good chance against a competent monster imagine that in online chess one side consisted of one player the other of four players who were not allowed to communicate at all the one player is naturally going to be favored now instead imagine that the four players have the option of communicating by microphone if they plan in advance even then theres a good chance one of the four players will screw it up meaning that although the game is balanced the single player will win more often this line of thinking apparently has not crossed the minds of the developers or they simply do not care to examine extensive amounts of gameplay at various skill levels to get a view of game balance that is more grounded in reality i wouldnt recommend this game unless you have 5 seriously interested friends with very consistent schedules otherwise this will almost certainly be a waste of money especially this late into the games life,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,the game has potential but in its current state it doesnt possess enough content to stand the test of time wait to buy it when it goes on sale a year or so down the line maybe itll have more to do by then,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,nominated for the missed potential award,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,this is for the stage 2 update and if you should give the game a second chance video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwblqlas09vs text evolve suffered from massive issues going from unbalanced gameplay to many game modes to manage and a nonexistent player base to play them the various monsters dlc skins and unlocks only added to the commercial confusion for players that wanted to get into it stage 2 does away with all of that everything is struck flat into a fairly straightforward unlock system using silver keys ala riot points or gold or other f2p currency and you get some every match to upgrade your character unlock new monsters and various skins as well a much cleaner system that allows for people to get their feet wet and unlock things gradually but not requiring a large upfront commitment the gameplay has also been rebalanced redone in various ways firstly all modes except hunt are gone this might upset some people but i view as a good thing it allowed focus on balancing one game mode to the best of their ability instead of spreading resources to thin and they did a pretty damn good job so far the gameplay changes have shifted a lot of the run 15 minutes and pray your trapper doesnt miss or the dont let them find me until im lvl3 evolved into a more gradual shift in power and more interaction and combat between players and monster with less stress and more teamwork for the hunters allowed a much less toxic experience overall i really do suggest taking a second look at evolve stage 2 its core hasnt changed but it has received one of the best rebalance and business model changes ive seen in years,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,rip evolve you will always be remembered and never forgotten and to all who have seen this games full potential and know it could have been capable of more its been good hunting with you,1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,good game i just wish others thought that way,1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,putting the controller on my nuts while it vibrates is the most exciting thing i get out of this game,-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,tldr a game of untapped potential soiled by poor execution and brand handeling over its lifetime pros atmospheric interesting concept eyecatching character and monster designs competitive 4v1 its a game unlike any other cons broken matchmaking system incredibly grindy to unlock anyone since the patch hard to learn hard to master gameplay a learning curve the size of a small skyscraper variations of characters flood the shop full price for slight tweaks a game that requires coordination and composure not a bad thing but never gives new players that chance off the cuff balancing that either incapacitates a character completely or raises one to godhood i want to like evolve i really do the aesthetic is intriguing albeit everything is quite gray characters have suprising depth and relationships that are expanded upon during prep in cute little conversations and the premise itself of a 4v1 gritty hunt is really interesting but hot damn if it isnt easy to get the fun absolutely tomped out of you by some rank 100 monster little backstory i had convinced 3 of my friends to join me in playing evolve stage 2 i had played the game a little back during the beta for just evolve and my friends liked the l4d series enough to join me in experiencing the rebirth of evolve so we play the tutorial do some bot matches and get the hang of some characters generally having a pretty jolly old time we finally decide to buckle up and begin our first real online match weve all got our naked banners and brand new characters naive smiles on our face we arent waiting long thankfully before a behemoth shows up but unfortunately the first monster we encounter has this glowing gold trimmed banner with three black claw marks were getting a little nervous since we had no idea what that meant but we quickly learned that when that banner shows up expect the game to wrap up preeeeetty damn quick to cut this short after evolving withing 3 minutes he brutally murded our crew one by one leaving us feeling so dejected as this veteran has his way with our virgin booties we kept trying though and eventually we had 2 matches with people who were also brand spanking new it was still difficult which is a good thing the game should be challenging but after we successfully hunted those 2 new monsters we left the matches feeling how should i put it tired it was fun sure but during that hunt everyone was silently focusing and making calls ive never heard a voip server so quiet with people in it actively playing together fighting monsters feels like such a mudslinging battle it is a tiring experience when were winning so you can imagine how draining and salt inducing it is to get smashed by a veteran as of writing this me and my crew are sitting at about maybe a 15 winrate thats being generous probably but it has been a bloody salt soaked experience attempting to learn this game i know what youre thinking we just started were expected to be bad keep practicing and youll get better work for your reward i agree too thats why we kept playing we told ourselves yeah were bad but lets keep at it and well eventually get better lets keep giving it a good ol college try its just a game after all but holy hell when the learning curve is the size of a small building and has 200 hours on you its really hard to climb above it hell its hard enough to break that challenges armor yet alone win a game against it 4v1 is extremely difficult to balance naturally the 4s are weaker indiviually than the 1 and rely on communication and coordination to overcome the 1 and hell people on the subreddit for evolve even complain the game is becoming too huntercentric how hunters are too strong and the monsters are getting shafted but weve never seen that happen the veterans have made sure of it hell one gold skinned behemoth took down our crew without even using his 4wall at least that guy was a nice one naturally with online games youll have some bad apples but thats besides the point like i said i want to like evolve its so interesting but as long as were stuck without a matchmaking system and some questionable balance choices 300 price increase on everything has really riled everyone up we cant get into it unless youre having an incredible amount of fun getting your face stuffed in the dirt every round youre time will be better spent elsewhere good luck taking the plunge because youll come out with some true grit if you hone yourself on this incredibly unstable game,-1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,if i had to pay the full price i would expect a collectors edition in ing gold,-1,1

275850,No Man's Sky,this was my review prior to the 11 update this game has failed miserably i am very annoyed that i am stuck with this garbage in my game library because it is completely terrible and i will most likely never play it again when the game first came out it had over 200000 players on at one point now there is a mear 800 if that doesnt prove this game is the biggest scam of 2016 i dont know what does the devs completely lied about countless features that were meant to be in this game i clearly had very strong feeling about the game after playing for about 40 or so hours but now that hello games have released the new update i decided i needed to revist the game in order to see what sort of improvements were made obviously the update doesnt add all the features we were told about before the game was launched but it does add content that we had all hoped to receive and thats awesome it shows that hello games have started taking a step in the right direction in hopes to fix their game i really did enjoy the game when it first was released but did quickly realize how much content was actually not in the game its very nice to see the developers going back to try fixing this by adding content many players were excited about thoughts about the 11 update game modes the additon of game modes is very nice i think its a great way to allow different kinds of players to enjoy the game the three modes are normal this is what most players who revisit the game will know its basically the same as before 11 but with the new content such as base building survival practically the same as normal but with a very steep learning curve i personally really loved the challenge you start in a random location on a planet from my multiple games i noticed all the planets had some sort of harsh environment and in order to get your ship you have to gather materials and reach you ship the ship seemed to be anywhere from 815 minutes away from your spawn location creative much like creative mode in minecraft you have god mode and unlimited materials its a great mode for building up a base if you want to see what all you can do with it base building the base building is fun and simple being able to set up a planet as a home base was something i was excited about from the start of the game its very simple and i can already tell how useful the bases will actually be they will not be something you spend time on and then forget about within an hour hiring people from the different races is an interesting way to liven up the bases as you hire people to work at your base they will give you missions to go gather materials in order to advance or learn how to make a new building the base researches is a great way to add somwhat of a questing system within the bases it seems like you have you own personally space stations which is very nice no more flying back and forth once you fill up your ship with materials having a teleporter that can transport you from the space station to your base is actually very cool i always hated having to fly to the space station just to buy some material i couldnt find on the planets easily materials the new materials are interesting i like the idea of needing to research certain equipment in order to harvest new materials some of the new materials require you to have sort of gauntlet in order to harvest i think its great that you now need more than just your multitool in order to fully harvest a planet for all of its worth as i said above i really enjoyed experiencing the new content and found it very simple yet enjoyable i think its great to see hello games finally make a comeback after letting down so many people its obvious they spent a lot of time on the new content in order to make it up to the older players and to make sure they gave quality content to their players this is probably the part where i start to get thumbs down because of my review after revisiting nms and checking out the newest update i think 99 of the recent reviews on this game should be removed they are clearly people who hardly tried the game before deciding they wanted to give it a negative review like everyone else if you read their reviews they cant even tell you want they disliked about the game how can you give a negative review but not explain what you disliked i think hello games did a great job with the 11 update and i think that most of the negative reviews should be ignored until you get the check out the game yourself,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,if they keep updating it ill keep playing it,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,look this game received a ton of flak however the foundation update demonstrated that hello games actually cares about their product and will try to make it what we expected,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,the 11 update is amazing if you still have the game give it another chance i recommend it 11 sadly is how this game should have launched with the promise of more to come afterward great work dev team keep it up edit12172016 i fell for the hype and purchased the game when it was nearly full price i did use a coupon to lower the price before buying because i never really buy games at full price it was a mistake the base game was great fun for about 4 hours and then it fell apart when i started to see that the gameplay was overly repetative and the features were lacking this update brought many features that brought me back and had me playing for many of the hours i refused to invest in the first version of the game due to the fact that it just felt tedious i agree with many that the game should have been launched as a 20 or less indie game rather than at a big budget cost i also agree that the 11 update brings some items to the game that should have bee there to begin with as i said 11 is how the game should have launched and add that to the edited in comment about 20 dollars or less being the pricepoint they made a ton of mistakes in the marketing and launch of the game however i have hope that it can still be made great long after the hype and be enjoyable i have hope that somehow they can patch in a large sum of content that might bring the value closer to the price point it launched at however i know that is not very likely i am not forgiving the horrible marketing of this game and far too early featureless release of the game im just hoping they can keep adding to the game that i already own and continue moving it in a direction that brings it closer to the hyped promises that brought me to purchase it early on at launch if only they had just called it an early access alpha beta rather than a full release,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,this game is 100 exploration hardly any combat to speak of progression is more abstract than concrete it is solitary mellow and a touch repetitive its sort of like fact checking this is a game you probably know beforehand if you will like it or not i cannot stress enough this game is all exploration if you do not like exploration if you dont have a sense of wanderlust if you dont get gripped by a need to know things or by an air of mystery you will not like this game this is a niche game a very good niche game but niche nonetheless it does not appeal to everyone and i doubt it ever will me though i love it edit first off i would like to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my review everything said has been hilarious at best and interesting at worst ive never had a review explode like this before so this is been kinda cool for me anyways a few further thoughts in response to other peoples thoughts on the topic of the game not runningbeing buggedbad port i havent experience this myself i have an intel i54590 nvidia gtx 970 and 12 gb ram and im running the game 1920x1080 antialiasing off anisotropic filtering 2 textureshadowgenerationreflection all high and max fps 30 with those specssettings the game literally runs just fine for me ive experienced no crashes and no bugs every now and then the game will hang up a second or two went i arrive somewhere new but thats it for me this has been a nonissue for me personally i cannot comment on that aspect further as for missing gameplay featuresthis is also more of a nonissue for me personally i personally dont care if i can see other people in the universe or not i expected this game to be solitary so it was what i expected aside from multiplayer features i dont really know what else everyone is saying is lacking from the final release i did not closely follow the prerelease buzz because i was going to get this game anyways so i am not informed as to what else was promised that is not present concerns about repetition in relation to limited content and procedural generation are valid true the pool of parts the algorithms can pick from is rather tiny indeed many planets have a tendency to feel samey overall and i would say that this is the weakest aspect of the game however i personally am willing to accept this limitation as a trade off for the game existing in the first place i bushed along this this topic in the review above but i will elaborate a little further exploring places that feel similar is a bad thing yes but i do not find this to be the focus the focus is more abstract i feel this game is more about exploration itself rather than the results of the exploration arguments about resource management i would say are half valid from my experience so far the resource gather is more at your pace than at the games pace if i want to sit around on a moon mining gold and gathering a big reserve of plutonium i can if i just want to grab enough fuel to hop to the next system i can do that too your daytoday resource requirements in the game are very low you can easily get upgraded ships and multitools just by exploring and without ever mining for resources to sell even warp cells require very small amounts of resources 50 carbon 100 plutonium 50 heridium 50 zinc and 100 thamium9 in total if you make it from scratch for reference your suits inventory slots have a maximum stack size of 250 and with just a few upgrades to the multitool mining is very fast furthermore this game is secondarily a survival game and resource management is an important aspect of survival gameplay i do not see any problem with the resource system in game since i feel like this is exactly what would happen in the world of no mans sky decentralized harvestingproduction of goods due to extremely advanced technology that allows individuals to be nomads and just grab elements they need to manufacture goods they need directly in close i am still enjoying this game and i anticipate any aspects will be fixed and expanded upon within the coming months that said if hello games doesnt get the pc port better optimized then at least half the criticism leveled at them will be totally valid also if they dont add more content then i will certainly be disappointed i do agree that 60 feels steep for a game a mile wide and an inch deep but i myself personally paid full price as an way of paying forward further development and because i was very excited for an exploration game that veered more into hard scifi,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,this is a very educational game that teaches you the concepts of false advertising as well as the consequences of preordering video games im sure glad i spent 60 to learn this valuable lesson you can not get this kind of education anywhere else,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,16 hours played for me and it only came out today oo suffice to say i love this game ive been following it for three years and its just what i expected from it which seems to be for a lot of other people a problem in that they expected things of it that it was never meant to be this is an exploration and survival game its as much art as game its like stepping inside an old fashioned scifi book cover from the asimovheinlein days its beautiful stark contemplative at times harrowing at others ive seen this question asked about 47000 times the last three years what do you do in no mans sky simply put you explore period its a vast universe of wonder and youre there to check it out sometimes youll shoot things sometimes things will shoot back sometimes pirates will try to spread your atoms across space sometimes a krakendinosaursquid will try to eat you but none of that is what you do its just stuff that happens along the way this game is about exploring and the wonder that is the universe if thats boring to you do not buy this game if you have to shoot things every 5 seconds to be happy do not buy this game this game is frequently mellow and contemplative its art its science its beauty and occasionally its a game and thats enough for me and then some there is no multiplayer nor do i want any its you and the universe go see whats there thank you to sean murray and the hello games team for bringing my childhood dreams to life reading heinlein and asimov as a kid playing the original elite back in the 1980s seeing those planets in every space game for 30 years and knowing theyre just painted textures and you cant go down to them i always wanted to go down to them and i wanted them to be amazing and now i can and its awesome d update 3 days in still love it but holy hell the venom and salt being spewed in the comments i feel compelled to add a bit to my review to head some of that garbage off you are allowed to not like or be interested in this game just as i am allowed to like it suggesting that no one could possibly like this game is idiotic clearly many of us do enjoy it very much more so than most games this is a niche game that will appeal to a very specific set of personal tastes if its your thing you will love it if its not you will find it crushingly boring personally its great for me and what i like but its not for everyone maybe even not for most people if you arent sure this game is for you then do some research there are hundreds of lets play videos already up on youtube you can see before you buy exactly what the game is like there is at this point no excuse for not knowing what youre getting with this game whether its worth 60 is a personal decision for me it is others may want to wait for a sale yet others wouldnt like it even if it were free theres plenty of material out there now to make an informed decision update 2 final thoughts 2 weeks on im basically done with the game now at 94 hours ive exhausted the ugprade tree perfect ship perfect multitool perfect suit while i intend to revisit now and again just to check out new planets sometimes gamewise ive done all it has to offer since i know whats at the center of the galaxy is basically nothing theres no strong compulsion left to play it a lot i still stand by my positive review but ill also agree the game as a whole is a missed opportunity i enjoyed what it had to offer for about a week and a half and then i exhausted it it was a very enjoyable week and a half but i had hoped for more 94 hours for 60 is not bad at all and im satisfied with my purchase but i realize im very likely in the minority this is an indie game and an impressive technical achievement but they got greedy it probably shouldve been 30 at most if theyd done that plus been honest that this is a limited indie game and to temper peoples expectations i think it wouldve gone over much better with most people i remain hopeful they will continue to support this game to add content and features its a promising start but clearly incomplete in many ways ill revisit it in the future and see what theyve done to it it would be a shame for something this promising to merely be abandoned because of a bad first impression,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,intro this review covers a lot of the political repercussions of the poor launch reception but also discusses some key game features and their improvements the nature of this review can cause quite a controversy so read at your own risk important note for improvement the game is much more likely to achive a greater improvement if the development team is motivated to improve it negative reinforcement alone is not a good motivator at all and in fact can leave the person or people in question unmotivated to do anything i feel that if we want to see good improvements on this game we should give more support to the good features of the game but in so we must not forget the bad ones either grinding well the game has a lot of grinding as do other games and the grinding can be fun but if you are just playing the game to complete it then the grinding becomes the main objective and it can become very boring if you take your time to explore and scan creatures and appreciate some of the good ones then you can expect to have a nice evened out experience size of the game the game is big very big the game consists of more planets than you will ever be able to set foot on so there is that but at the same time this is just kind of an illusion as you are going around from planet to planet eventually you will realise that there is not a huge amount of variation amoungst the plannets but there is enough to give you that illusion if you let it of course you can nit pick and look really closely and break the illusion but you are only doing that to yourself take it like a picture best viewed from a certain distance exploration it is no lie that no mans sky has a veriety of means to produce novel situations to the player this is wonderful and really helps drive your onwards the creatures that you discover can be very different from one another however you need to take this with a pinch of salt it cant be easy trying to populate a game with all kinds of new creatures when the game is as big as no mans sky there is a wonderful video that explains how the creatures in no mans sky are made up i recommend taking a look at it if you are interested story the game has an objective but also has freedom the main objective if you want to call it that is to get to the center of the universe yes you can do that but you can also take your time in doing so that is how i have played it and i am enjoying myself doing so you can really immerse yourself along the way and enjoy the game as an exploration space travel who does not love space travel and no mans sky does it wonderfully i can fly down to a planet and blast off from one with no loading screen and i can explore a vast collection of star systems and fly wherever i want the game does this brillinatly the only drawback from this is the inavbillity to fly close to structures and terrain with your space craft this really breaks the illusion of flight and makes it feel like you are being bubble wrapped and your hand is being held maybe i want to crash into the ground ground combat the combat in the game is some of the weakest combat i have experienced in gaming however the combat is there it exists and i am happy that they put it in the game the ground combat at least gives me some sense of danger whilst you are roaming around on the ground doing your thing however the ground combat is really easy and does not pose much of a threat this could really do with a tweak ship combat well the ship combat in the game is a different story i personally like the ship combat with a pinch of salt but yet again the inabillity to fly close to objects and terrain ruin it so much i want to fear the ground and other objects as i battle it out in my ship i want to use them to my advantage as i take risks by flying close to the ground so that my enemy struggles to keep up besides this immersion breaker the ship combat is awesome and does what it says on the tin however it is few and far between you are not going to be finding a lot of combat unless you go out looking for it and even when you do it can take a while to find it crafting amp inventory of lord of lord the crafting and inventory system needed a lot of work and work has been done the inventory system was lacking to say the least and the crafting was simply combing two objects to make one it felt very tacked on in the game i am sorry hello games but this is one of the things that i couldnt stand in no mans sky and it needs an overhaul i will however give it props that it does work and it does what it says on the tin so i cant complain too much it is not somthing that will ruin your time playing no mans sky but sheesh it could do with a little touch up value a lot of people critise the game for its price and i completely get that i do see how the game could be a bit too pricey yes it is pretty costly but i am keeping my hopes up that with more and more updates the game will become worth the original money that i payed for it the first update marks a great step towords a great game and i have faith that the updates will keep on rolling out note on support i know that the advertisement was really missleading and i know that the game was over hyped by a lot of people but if we keep throwing insults at the game just for the sake of it and just falling into confirmation bias then all we will see is a crap game try not to be driven like a sheep with horse blinders on and make your own oppinion of the game and not the advertisement or polotics that run with it what we have here is a good game its not the best game by any means but it is not a bad game at all i have really enjoyed my time in no mans sky and will continue to play the game be unique and make your own oppinion of the game and dont follow the mass of people that are slandering the game for political reasons alone note on negative reviews the majority of negative reviews are unfortunatly the product of something called groupthink look it up where a large mass has come together and followed majority view and slandered the game without any real thought in fact a lot of the reviews you will see have only reviewed this game so you can see by this that they are just jumping on the band wagon and giving it a negative review however before you go crazy on me some of the negative reviews in fact a lot of the negative reviews highlight a lot of really helpful things that the development team can take action on these are constructive reviews and well explained personal oppinion and i respect them note on posotive reviews the positive reviews on no mans sky are lacking and i am making an inference based on the key points i have discussed that this is a product of the bystander effect look it up of course by saying this i am making the assumption that hello games is a victim in this and i know that will spark a rather large proportion of controvecy so please think of it as this everyone is attacking the development team and no one wants to help by giving an alternate view in fear of being attacked themselves yet again i erge you to make your own oppinions tldr the game itself is fantastic i love it and will continue to play it i have outlined a lot of the reasons as to why the game is seen as such a negative thing the game has a few immersion breaking features but can be overlooked as an exploration game its brilliant as a survivalfps it lacks overall i will recommend no mans sky not only to people that are new to it but also those that have purchased it before the update give it another go and please make your own oppinion of the game dont fall into groupthink ps i value all others oppinions and i am open to constructive criticism of my review respect people and people respect you,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,the game was boring and repetative everyone on it and got refunds press tore the devs a new but then instead of cutting and running they decided to overcome their bad situation and kept developing the game the result is the first of many updates the foundations update this update adds sooo much to the game new resources new modules a base building system the ability to purchase a freighter and upgrade it several bug fixes and more well done guys and thank you for not abandoning us,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i think the game was rushed for its initial scheduled release and you could tell this a mile off basically the devs simply didnt have the time to include a lot of the features that they wanted to at that time a lot of people saw it as some kind of money grab but i think it was due to time constraints more than anything you also have to remember that this is a hugely ambitious game the added features from the foundation update have made the game a lot more enjoyable though survival mode in particular has addressed what was previously my main criticism of the game in that it simply wasnt challenging enough also planets have now been improved considerably which is another big plus point hopefully the devs now have the time to work on more exciting additional features that will make this game into the space exploration game many of us want it to be the foundation update has certainly given us hope in that regard ill probably come back to write a more detailed review at a later stage,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,this new update brings a major improvement to no mans sky overall the main problem with no mans sky in the beginning was the lack of content promised this update is the foundation of fulfilling those broken promises this update includes an all new base building system which includes the ability to build bases both on planets and inside of all new space freighters which are purchasable with ingame currency there has also been a graphics and terrain generation improvement in this update some things which still need fixing my framerate still lies at around 40fps even though my pc is a beast some graphical things such as the terrain generation grid showing on distance mountains and some textures in the new freighters near the freighter doors are glitching out overall this update is a great step in the right direction,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i believe a bad approach to advertisment is what lead no mans sky to its savage let down instead of saying this is how the game is now it should have been released as an early access game ie alpha or beta and hello games should have told us the true state of the game and heres what we are going to be working really hard to achieve in the coming months if that were the way no mans sky were marketed then i blieve everything would have been just fine the game is great if you accept it for what it is laid back exploration and a sense of how small we are compared to this universe we are a part of the 11 foundation update is a great addition to the game in my opinion you have to give props to a small team of 8 people that they didnt just give up after the massive uproar of the gaming community against them they really buckled down and put forth a lot of effort to prove to us that they are in this for the long haul and will stick with us and their game you can really tell in the update that there is a lot more in store for no mans sky and that is really exciting all in all i would say if you are curious about no mans sky wait for a steam sale or family share it with a friend give it a shot it really is worth a chance,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i was hooked on no mans sky from the first few minutes i played i followed it pretty closely for about a year leading up to it finally being released i was intrigued by the idea of free exploration on a grand scale and i wasnt disappointed some people dont think theres anything to do prefoundation update but ive always felt the exploration itself and the freedom it provides was where all the enjoyment comes from i just love exploring all the nooks and crannies of each planet i land on and generally spend 68 hours per planet before the inclination hits me to move on and see what the next planet has in store the foundation update has provided more terrain complexity more animal ai and interaction better vegetation etc along with basebuilding with farming and quests better space battles and huge freighters to buy im more an explorer so im just enjoying the even better scenery and ability to do what i went when i want and where i want on 18 quintillion planets after 230 plus hours i just continue to enjoy it more and more,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i completely understand why this game has a largely negative review score its most definitely not the game that many were expecting even so i would still highly reccommend this game to anyone when the game came out it was a slow grindfest of resource collection and practically baren planets many of the features hello games had said would be in the game were absent what was given was pretty much an early access game for full price thus far this sounds really negative but hear me out many people that played the game had the sole intent of getting to the fabled center of the galaxy as quickly as they possibly could and realised that the game is actually not as longrewardingintersting as they had hoped i will tell you right now dont rush through this game if anything dont even journey towards the center take your time get to know a single star system for a large amount of time and youll see what hello games was going for a sprawling universe with almost endless posibilities personally i found the game most rewarding when screenshot hunting the game although not graphically the most beautiful game compared to something like the witcher 3 or battlefield 1 it has an almost breathtaking art design that when captured at the right moment can make any scifi lover squeal adding on to that as of today 11272016 update 11 aka the foundation update has been released the foundation update brings an extremely comprehensive refresh to the entire no mans sky making the game feel almost completely different in short base building is finally introduced a new harsher survival mode is also available many tweaks have been made to the game overall to make the experience much more enticing thats the beauty of this early access structure this game has as polygon said no mans sky is the new destiny in the sense that destiny when released was lacking in fulfilling package of content however look at the state of destiny now many still play the game and expansions have kept destiny thriving years after its initial release the same is likely to happen with no mans sky with the foundation update this is the start of larger things to come also in defense of hellow games they are quite literally a fifteen person team many aaa games are developed with teams spanning up to 500 people the fact that no mans sky is playable in any state right now is quite amazing in other words let this small team work their magic the game is still evolving to become their vision,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,the foundation update has made this absolutely worth another shot survival mode is a lot of fun i have faith that devs will continue to update making this more amazing recommended,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,new update improves so much i love it,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i greatly appreciate that in the face of adveristy and much negativity that theyre still continuing to work on and improve the game that shows that this wasnt just some cash grab the team genuinely believe in what theyre doing i always enjoyed the game though it still may not be for everyone but im definitely impressed,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,while the inital offering of no mans sky was underwhelming and stunk of the megahype that was once spore the changes that have come unlike with spore have really brought a lot to the game that was missing not only had they added some much requested big features theyve added new elements and new crafting requirements and improvement to the depth of game play im much happeir with it now and think it deserves a second look,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,ok so i dont do many reviews so just stay with me here we all know what nms is and what it didnt turn out to be i didnt buy nms for full price and nor would i buy it for that price i got it on sale and i reccomend if youre looking at getting this game now is the time the reason i didnt buy nms when it first came out was i thought it was too hyped and a hell of a lot was promised and i was lucky with that decision nms fell harder than the comet that wiped out the dinosaurs it got awful reviews i watched gameplay after gameplay not believing my eyes at what i was seeing so skip to 3 days ago when i brought the game hence the low hours but still not too bad for 3 days when i have other commitments the reason i decided to buy it was reading the newest reviews and hearing about the foundation patch so it started to interest me now we can build we can have frieghters have farmers and armourers live with you on your planet base side note they move with you when you set up a new base on a new planet after you install their terminals you dont know how happy i was about that i was like please dont let me have to travel all the way back there haha and theyve added a bunch of other new stuff go read patch notes gameplay is good its a slow grindy game and to be honest i like that i like games where i can go out do what i please and dont have to follow a storyline or stuff like that graphics are great i love how i can go from one planet to the other and its different maybe not massively like a toxic planet on one system is roughly going to be the same on the next but if you take your time like i do then youll notice all the little differences that the generator has made iv seen quite a few planets now water world toxic wastelands fiery messes hell the planet iv set up shop on for now iv called it womans emotions as it can go from 13 degress to 100 degress literally every 5 minutes with a storm but the reason iv set up on this planet for now is because its covered in mountains of gold so making a fair few bucks there thats unless the space pirates scan my cargo get wide eyed and screw my up haha iv had no problems with crashes or freezing iv had fps drops but nothing that would cause me any dramas the thing you really will struggle with is inventory you ask anyone who plays and likes nms what really makes them pull their hair out its inventory because your kit upgrades go into the same slots as items so youre constanly moving stuff around etc etc etc its a chill game you go on you fly around you go to another sytem check out whats there maybe even go through a black hole and be shot 13 lightyears away like i did you harvest you sell you get stuck ona planet because your thrusters are empty again because you didnt bring resources just in case if slow grindy gameplay that you dont have to follow the storyline isnt your cup of tea stay away far far away from this but if you want a game to chill to get it have fun with it and find out for yourself thats the reason youre on here to see what others think in my opinion a lot of the people who have given negative reviews either need to change and tweak them or reinstall it and check out what this new patch has done for the game and nms are working on more things but we did wait 3 months for the foundation patch but some games you wait even longer cough dragonthegame cough cough yea but if youre seriously interested give it a go try going on creative so youre not grinding for the res like me and you can just mess around and see if it is for you out of 10 hmm id say 710 for now its a lot better than what it was it has everything i like and it is a good game hello games just shot themselves in the foot at the start but theyre slowly making up for it,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,those of you who refunded the game i doubt youre gonna come back to this as i feel this update really isnt enough to do that however for us lot who held onto the game for various reasons whether you couldnt refund it or just ignored it i recommend you give it a go hello games has done a good job with this update adding the huge capital ship sized freighters which you can build inside and summon at will base building on planets with pretty standard building pieces and decorations but look nice in its artstyle all the same more resources to collect for example killing animals no longer collects carbon but mordite and some general fixes and graphical upgrades like motion blur and temporal aliasing the new update also added new gamemodes such as creative survival and the normal game mode similar to before the foundation update the survival mode makes the game so much harder as life support runs out much faster and resources are more scarce than before creative mode makes you a god completely invincible and with unlimited resources and money allowing you to just explore and build wherever you want without having to worry about running out of resources or units bearing in mind hello games said this update was the first of many to come id say it was a pretty good start and if all the updates are to this standard then this game will be awesome within 23 more updates personally i wish hello games would add multiplayer as a priority so we can finally find each other within the galaxy as this would only make the game far better than it already is overall still not entirely the game that sean murray promised but its on the way there and its nice to see hello games didnt take the money and run,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i played this game for 244 hours prior to 11 release because like many others i thought the game would actually provide me with something the game was fun for the first 10 hours and then that was it now with the foundation update ive played for 527 hours in the last 3 days and im still finding new things they actually more than doubled the amount of different resources scattered them in many different kinds of planets and star systems and actually prompted you to go out and explore the beacons are amazing in that you can actually revisit the place youve been and home base is fantastic feeling like you actually belong in the universe tldr 11 update saved the game,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i have a lot of respect for this team for not just packing up and running with whatever cash theyve made to put out a large update with all the negative energy thrown their way shows intengrity im not here to change minds if youve made your decision about this game i doubt its even possible id had my fill prior to this update as well i had some fun but my efforts felt futile and aimless the addition of being able to make a homestead and or purchase a freighter has for me given the game instantly more structure i feel as if i belong in the universe now rather than just hopping around for no apparent reason exploration has an immediate purpose and reward im no longer focused on just finding the center of the universe it feels like a game world now not just a artsy proof of concept which i feel is a huge step in the right direction if they continue to flesh out these buidling systems and were to add more survival elements wed be looking at a universe scale survival game with limitless exploration im impressed its still not for everyone but its changed my opinion about both the game and the team behind it edit spelling errors,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,its still not the game promised but its most certainly a big step in the right direction but even while you can build bases customize freighters etc youre still just exploring planets that look all too similar searching for whatever however im enjoying base building so much that im recommending it i cant wait for future updates so should you get it i recommend you wait for at least one more major update then wait a week after that watch some videos on the update then decide this game is more like a seemingly pointless exploration game which is strange for me to describe because i constantly come back to it looking foward to doingi dont know but whatever it is im enjoying it and if hg adds some sort of coop better than full on multiplayer in my opinion then id be sold and it would have two thumbs up from me i know this sounds like a mixed review and it most certainly is but im about 60 yes and 15 no and 25 wait for more updates tldr good game game seems about 35 or so wait until its worth what you think should be 60 then get it,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,11 update really added a new layer to the game it looks and feels better with some cool features hopefully the updates keep coming,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,the refund button works well,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,dont know how it was like prepatch but as a newcommer the game is really fun to explore and progress your shiptools playing normal mode i never see the necessity to grind or rush the game of course for those who want more challenge they have added a survival mode although i havent tried it yet other reviews of the update say it has given the game a nice urgent feeling restarts are required if you land in a impossible planet though sorta feels like all the negativity was overblown if that was cause of the update then awesome if this was the foundation the future updates will keep improving the game to be honest 35 is the appropriate price for the game right now it should have never been released at 60 nor be given the nod by devs that it should be treated as a 100 finished game although at the time of this review my play time is still a little minor the nichness of the game is really apparent i do love this kind of gameplay loop so it will keep me going for a while especially with what the update addedchanged like with any game charging right through its content will probably leave a more negative experience as well edit to clarify this is not an indictment to those who felt slighted by the developers i am saying the update to me as a newcomer to the game and someone who relatively ignored the hyperesponse to the game it feels like it had been really blown out there so thats a positive if the patch and future updates gave me this different perception of the game with the continued stream of updates this will become stronger in time so that should be a positive thing if everyones activism had them change their entire ideology after release,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,there is so much hate for this game and i can see why 60 for an alpha wth but honestly this game isnt as bad as many make it out to be youll read more and more negative comments but most of these people dont even understand the game to start this game is massive they didnt randomly generate a game world a solar system a galaxy no they randomly generated a freaking universe 225 galaxies to explore 18 quintillion planets to land on seamlessly with 0 loading screens unless youre jumping from one star system to the next but even then load times are 15 second all of this packed into a 2gb package that alone makes this game impressive af but lets get down to the meat and bones the gameplay it consists of mostly walking scanning alien life objects flora shooting rocks gathering materials the basics just like every other survival game but now with the new update theyve really shown what this game is capable of now you can claim a planet for yourself build a base on it hire alien specialist to gain more technologies blueprints etc you can farm rare plants to gain important material purchase a gargantuan freighter and load it up with materials to then fly to other systems and sell for major profits wanna customize that freighter well you can you can build inside of it just as if it were a planet side base and fill it with whatever honestly this game is flawed it isnt great but it is good this update is the first step the team of 15 at hello games yes 15 people made this game in the right direction if you deleted this or werent able to get a refund and just pushed it from your mind now would be the time to get back into it the next update codenamed biggie is right around the corner and the content in this current one is worth the time i promise they rebalanced everything and added a load of content give no mans sky a second chance you wont regret it,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,is this game perfect no but update 11 proves that hello games is working very hard on this i see a lot of future in this game,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,when nms first came out i played for about 30 hours like most peoples experience the first dozen hours were the most fun fixing up your ship discovering a new planet starting the atlas path etc it was hugely disappointing when it turned out there wasnt anything at the centre i never got there but read about it and finishing the atlas path didnt really seem worth it however i still enjoyed most of my time with the game so i put it down and waited hg had talked about free dlc and it definately felt like they had been a little rushed to get the game out there was stuff that i thought would be in the game that wasnt quite a lot but i am pretty used to that by now so many games have had reveal trailers that make them seem to be something other than the final game you end up playing still i had confidence in hg adding those things in over time the silence was a bit annoying but i think a lot of people vastly overeacted for such a small team the reception and hounding from certain communities online must have been crushing they poured heart and soul into this game even lacking much that was hinted at it is quite unique and i think there only option was keep quiet and work hard to deliver updates that realised its potential the last thing they needed was to make promises they may not be able to keep the game suffered because of monumental hype and it obviously was too much for some people when it didnt fully deliver ever single thing they expected the foundation update has made me love this game again i started a survival mode game and its so much more rewarding than the normal mode even though i must have died about 12 times so far it forces you to plan ahead i wont go to a new planet without enough plutonium to take off again often hanging around in the station hanger bay buying small amounts off each ship that comes in i also make sure i had enough power to recharge my exosuit systems incase i end up in an extreme enviroment that said i have still had at least three occasons where i have been pretty much resigned to my fate seeing no way out other than starting a new game stuck on an extreme planet with no way to recharge my suit and only small pockets of plutonium at distances too far to gather and return somehow i have always eventually found a way to continue even if that required gathering tiny amounts of plutonium with just enough time to transfer to my ship before death rinse and repeat enough to get back to a station and stock up again i have now built my frst base and am doing missions for the staff i have hired the update seems to have massively improved the diversity of planet generation my home planet has vast deep gorges sprawling cave networks and is a joy to explore i have seen planets with huge mountains far bigger than anything i saw previously and resource and flora placement gives the impression of different planet biomes as you explore a lot is familiar but it always seems an improvement on how it was previously generated i am really looking forward to what the next updates bring and hope hg can regain trust in those people that are cleary currently unable to forgive the past mistakes,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,nice game still with few performance issuefoundation update was a good start just dont stopsometimes just closing the game and drop back to the system without any error messagesometimes after planet get in the spaceship and start playing in the ship with 5fpsget out from the shipeverything fine d,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,a decent game marred by a terrible release both due to misleading marketing and an unfinished game so what was the problem,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after foundation update 11 there is still hope,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,the foundation update is a huge step in right direction it showed that the developer does care the games and willing to listen to the community,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,before the foundations update the game was fun for a few hours before it got repetitive after the update i could spend several more hours playing ive setup a base in creative mode to test that new feature and am now looking for a frieghter to buy ive heard good things about those i wouldnt buy this game at full price however as it dosent yet have enough content but if its on sale definity pick it up and try it update so ive found a frieghter i like them so far using your x menu you can warp it to you from any system but you cannot warp your frieghter to a new position in the same system just discovered you can but you cannot manualy fly your freighter which would be awsome,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,this upvote is conditional if you see the game on sale for 2030 then grab it 60 is asking way too much as the game feels less complete than several of the early access games i have in my steam library i do not recommend the game at the 5999 price point at the time of this review i do not think you will be disappointed in the game if you get it for 20 if an open space exploration game sounds like fun to you the game is really relaxing theres really not much of a challenge unless youre playing on survival mode it is repetitive but visually pleasing therapeutic in a sense animals and planets are now more diverse since the foundation update and base building gives you a reason to revisit some planets whereas before there was no reason to travel backwards on your journey to the center let me take the chance to once again state that the game is very repetitive this is not a bad thing if you want a game that will give you predictable expectations i find it a great game in 2030 minute sessions a few times a week your mileage may vary,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,nms has gotten a bad rap ill be honest it has its good and bad points overall though the bad rap it has gotten was due to eitherstuff that didnt make it into release yet or stuff that people talked themselves into expecting that was never explicitly stated if you are looking for a game where you get to explore to your hearts content this is for you if you are looking for a game where you travel through the stars and deal with frustration from lacking though expandable inventory while trying to find the cool stuff this is for you if you are looking for something where you can group up with other people have massive trading or weaponized wars this game is not for you at least not yet though possibly not ever i came to this game expecting relaxing if challenging exploration i got what i expected i am happy with it and i am glad to see that it is still expanding,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,the update shows there is support for the game and for an indie developer there is a lot of content i harshly judged it at first ps sean lied and im about it but theyre trying to make it up to us,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,great comeback by hello games with the foundation update 11 at first was kind of disappointed during the initial release but after the update they really changed a lot of stuff my recommendation watch some gameplay footage check the discussions on reddit and only then decide whether or not is your type of game,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,this game simply failed to live up to hype it shows a lot of promise heres to hoping that the devs actually work on it like promised do not buy if your expecting a game where there is an end goal do buy if you know what your getting a game where you explore and catalogue biggest reccommedation if you have played elite dangerous and the part of that game you like the most is exploration this is probably the game for you if not play elite dangerous,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i bought this game because i like exploration game without any hype or expectation like most people had i was okay and cool with the initial release and was lucky that ive never had any crash like other user reported the gameplay itself was okay the game managed to keep me busy with exploring and discovering new creatures techs multitools and ships for first several hours after a while i suddenly already had discovered all the multitools and ships tech and it was only matter of time to discover the materials to build them discovering techs suddenly became boring multitools and ships came in different shape but with no different feature pistollike or riflelike i couldnt feel any difference what matters only the installed techs same goes for the ship whether is big or small it was really doesnt matter the shape purely is for cosmetics and i was not satisfied with this mechanics what keeps me up to play nms was purely because i like to explore and the gameplay itself wasnt that bad and now with the recent update nms was getting better with survival mode base build and what so ever yet to come i guess ill play this game regularly again for a while,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,this new update makes the game playable looking forward to where they go with this at 35 dollars i think it is a fair price but 60 is still overpriced,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,nice improvements in v11 release,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,lovely game lots of content still to come hopefully i feel like if this had retailed at half the price itd be hailed as a great success maybe if sean lied a bit less too or at least communicated properly,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,the new 11 update and survival mode add alot of promise to the game i had uninstalled it but playing survival mode is actually alot more fun than the original game mode,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after the 11 update finally i can recommend this game i was enjoying the previous version but i knew the market that suits the game is very niche with the latest update somehow it broadens the market and more people can enjoy this game the engine is solid the future was lost but now it resurface with the new update you might want to wait for cheaper price but current discount price at 40off is a good starting point,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,im going to review the game in its current state after the foundation update and say that the game is now mostly worth its pricetag i paid 60 on launch day expecting the very features that the foundation update brings and i am very pleased they are now present for example i bought minecraft in the beta stages and have been happy with their updates ever since i would look at the foundation update as version 10 in the same way pros the game will provide you the experience youre looking for you can milk the game and stay entertained for countless hours very much like minecraft you can rush through it iyou dont rush movies why rush this if you so choose base building is amazing though slightly buggy sentinels occasionally found indoors updates are promised on the horizon which will make the game a great investment cons still buggy as hell the game occasionally crashes to desktop so you must save often framerate will occasionally drop horrifically which is fixed with a game restart still no meaningful multiplayer capabilities from what i can tell,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,worth original price tag no however the update has put the wheels back on this wagon its now well worth the buy at the going rate of 23 with guaranteed free updates in the pipeline some are going to wait for further updates until the game content reaches a level that suits their needs but whos to say whether or when this price tag does not rise to previous point of sale at which point some are going to regret not grabbing it right now if future updates are anything like what we just got in in the 11 update then this game is stepping out of the shadows and back into the positive light of prelaunch expectations in my opinion and ought to be recognized for the innovation it undoubtedly is irrespective of postlaunch shortcomings many are already returning and are suitably impressed with the new content as it stands me too,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i was hoilding off on the review i wanted it to be positive because i have enjoyed the game thus far now with the update its starting to shape up to what it was advertised as although in saying that i would like more instructions on how to build a base etc but hey the game is coming along i got use to every star system having like 3 frigates in them after the update it is like the universe is alive and that youre not the only living thing in the universe i hope to see more improvements and at the least local co op play as i have had many friends say to me that they would have bought the original version of the game if it was co op now with the added base building etc it would be super cool anyways thats about it for now everything is looking super good for no mans sky and i am glad i was patient with the devs also it was a good idea to drop the price so kudos,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,okay this game is far from perfect but its really an incredible experience its beautiful surprising survival mode is very difficult and it was made by a very small team with all that in mind this game is definitely worth a try while it is on sale,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,ive never been a hater of this game but i totally understand that it under delivered in spectacular fashion this update feels much more like the proper release playing it on hard survival mode makes things instantly more engaging i found myself faced with a spaceship 8 minutes away and an environmental survival time of less than 3 minutes with very little cover or critical elements between me and the ship now thats very interesting,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i purchased this game on a steam sale for 35 ive had a lot of fun playing no mans sky but i had low expectations going in and did not play prior to the foundations update theres not a ton of depth with what is presently available the game is predominantly about exploring a procedurally generated universe and scavenging the necessary resources to do so i find it a relaxing exercise in wandering and poking my nose around in new locations to characterize the game overall id describe it as broad but shallow theres a lot of planets to explore but they have a relatively small number of themes to draw from theres crafting systems with discoverable recipes for many gameplay mechanics but the recipes for any individual mechanic have 4 or 5 elements xenobiology produces some interesting looking races but they generally fall into one of three or four distinct types more depth in each of these dimensions will make them feel more substantial and the universe less sameyfeeling the idea is interesting and should be rewarding to play for people who can appreciate slower paced games and a focus on explorative gameplay,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i know that this game has caught a ton of heat for misleading the consumers but if you listened to hello games from the beginning they constantly stated that the demo worlds were not what you would see they just showed a world that was representative of everything possible on one planet sean murray constantly stated for years that multiplayer would not be a thing the fans kept pushing him until he slipped and said that it would be possible but highly unlikely then the fans took it from there when the game released everyone was mad that they didnt get what they dreamed up they just got what was stated all those years ago well i never bought the hype just the game i have had a blast with it you may not i have found that it depends on the solar system you start with how your experience is i started another game on ps4 and have had a pretty awful time but you get that with procedurally generated games it is a fun space explorationcrafting game nothing more nothing less,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i bought it for 36 after the update it was still overpriced but i have had an absolute blast with the game if you are willing to spend the money you will have fun as long as you want to explore planets instead of rushing through the game the biggest problem with this game is it is very easy to play in a manner that will not be fun if you only follow the objectivies laid out for you like you would in most games you will not have fun but if you take the time to explore planets and scann flora and fauna and give them funny names you are going to have a great time that is what the game is all about yes there is not a tremendous amount of diversity among the planets but there is more than enought to make the game quite fun the only exploration game that i have played that is better than this is subnautica and sadly that one isnt is space if you want a space exploration game this is your gig nothing else on the market even compares by the way based off the newest update the game is only going to get better and it is already quite fun inb4 lt60 helpul because i said i liked this game rip this review,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,this is certainly a game that received a lot of hype hype that it didnt quite live up to but that doesnt mean it is a bad game the internet can be a dangerous place but if you start no mans sky with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is then its an extremely fun game however if you read whats out there on internet youll skip purchasing no mans sky every time but why not stop and think for yourself for a minute if you want a game with space exploration planet exploration guns grenades lasers and warp drives then no mans sky has it if youre after a game that takes your mind away from day to day life take you into another world with an incredible atmosphere then no mans sky does that the recent foundation update has shown a glimpse of what lies ahead for no mans sky it shows there is still a small dev team willing this game success and adding features what should have been there on release we may never know why the game was feature limited on release but i believe the future is bright for no mans sky very bright if you want a game with a deep complex story boss levels and explosions the size of a small city then no mans sky isnt for you but please make that decision for yourself pros great graphics wow moments wide variety of plants animals and minerals base building and research various game modes buy any ship with a wide variety buy a huge freighter that you can summons challenging moments cons can start to feel a bit samey after 20 hours doesnt yet include the features that were discussed during development story mode is pointless and doesnt emotionally involve you at all to keep you going some animals are just odd,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,with update 11 this no mans sky takes a big step into the right direction great work this is how the game should have launched,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,foundation update steam sale for 35 good purchase,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,well this is a risky review but all i can do is give an honest opinion on my experience lets start with this game is not something you have seen before dont try to fit it in with minecraft or elite dangerous dont compare it to fo4 or cod its not like anything youve ever played before its a true work of art that masquerades as a game look at the science involved in the generation real world science ill start with cost as thats a beast hello game is a british company if you have any idea of whats going on in the world i imagine you know what brexit is and how its raised the cost of everything in my country this is a 25 game prebrexit sorry about my fellow idiots they did mess everything up for me as well ive been waiting for something to stratch the exploration itch when this was released it was also mentioned that there would be base building for me thats what i was looking for a galaxy to explore and being able to call somewhere home when the foundation update dropped and i saw what it included that was all i needed to try the game out im not even close to being finished with it but i think that ive put in enough time to now have an opinion its a space exploration game yes its a bit grindy yes its beautiful theres quests upgrades ships tools space freighters pirates and aliens every planet is very different even when they initially look the same the detail in the generation is incredible and unfortunately appears to be overlooked by most ive discovered hundreds of stars planets plants and animals in my travels through space im busy learning three alien languages to allow me to understand the races i meet theres moral puzzles maths puzzles language puzzles and puzzles based around the races lore an example i found a monolith on a planet when i interacted with it it began to melt and i could see a creature frozen in the ice the monolith gave me two options i could leave the creature trapped or try to free it i chose to free it wrong choice i was actually distubing a sacred tomb and it lowered my standing with the race faction its a one off choice there is no changing your mind or having another go i actually love that i made the wrong decision for the right reasons and was punished for it its just not something you see in games the entire galaxy is full of little events like this where choices on a human level are just wrong as i explore further i keep finding little snippets of lore that teach me about the races their culture and history which in turn enables me to actually start to figure out the moral choice of the race rather than my own all through this im on a mission to gather as much knowledge about the galaxy as i can this in turn gives me access to better everything but best of all it happens naturally just by exploring yes theres space battles land battles creature fights the sentinels space police looting freighters environments thatll kill you but even on the harshest planets devoid of life theres beauty to be seen exploration to be had and knowledge to learn,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,ill keep it short and simple pros literally everything no mans sky fulfills everything i want in a space game i truly love it cons no multiplayer some may feel that its a bit repetitive although after the new foundation update 11 i do not get that feeling like i used to spoiler disappointing end to the atlas quest in my opinion that is while you get to find blackholes in the galactic map it just feels like i wasted 10 atlas stonesthe reason is you dont get to name the new star you built or even find it also the reason i put quotations on star is that there is no way to really know if one has been built or the game just says that give the game a chance it really is amazing and deserves some love justonemoreatlas stone aaaand its morning,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,there is so much beauty in the game its sad that there is so much annimosity pent up about the way too early release 11 is a good first step not permanatly dropping the price is a bad one 11 is not worth full asking price however a 20 might be there is so much potential for this game to be awesome and i do like it hg needs to keep the free updates coming and incrementally lower the price,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i was really hyped to play this game bought it right as i came out and was surely disappointed but with the new 11 update they made me playing it again and yeah its awsome just what we wanted with the promise more to come gj guys,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,despite all the hate i still love this relaxing game with the latest update it became interesting to start playing again and i cant wait until the next updates,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,if only they released foundation update from day 1,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,am i bummed that promised bullet points werent delivered yup am i still enjoying the game regardless yup,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i have enjoyed playing this game from the day it came out the beauty of the landscapes the sense of exploration and solitude of a spacebound wanderer are exhilarating and unique to any game ive played,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,with the new update this game is even better for an exploring junkie like me it is heaven thank you hello games,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i have been playing this game since day one and have enjoyed it since day one yes it was missing a great deal of the hyped content but it was still enjoyable as a game i did take a break as it did get repetitive but after the foundation update and seeing as hg is updating as promised i can really recommend this game i play in normal mode mostly but i hear survival is quite the challenge and upcoming mods and updates will continue to improve the experience,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,beautiful exploration game with room for improvement the recent update is a huge step in the right direction and im impressed with how quickly the devs were able to add so much looking forward to seeing what else they come up with over the next year,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i was gifted a copy of the game by a friend jf before the game release and i wasnt too pleased with what we got and i seriously was thinking on doing a review condemning the developer and the game now however with the release of the new foundation update and after playing the game for a few more hours i can honestly say the game is worth the sale price as of now its still on sale nov 30th 2016 and they have done allot of work getting this new and improved update out sure they still have a long way to go to make up for what i consider the fault of sony and starting with this update only shows that they are going to give us what they promised even though the trailers showed material not in the game at release time again the fault of sony do i recommend the game now yes i do so snap it up while you can in the long run you will most likely be happy that you did note disregard the naysayers out there they just cant admit too themselves that hg is here to stay and are heading in the right direction they want the game too fail miserably so they can slap themselves on the back so jump in folks and have fun with the game also note that the game is still in development meaning there is not only some great additions coming to the game but there will also be bugs that will need to be dealt with so stay tough and enjoy the ride it will be worth it in the end,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i held off buying this because of the hysteria surrounding it but with the recent update and price drop i thought id give it a go i know its not what a lot of people were expecting and there definitely are discussions to be had around the way games are presented prerelease but i personally am having a great time with this the game has its flaws but if you think it sounds like something you would be into then you shouldnt be put off by the negative reviews,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,at first this game was horrible after 11 its good but far from what it could be now theres actually things to do and you dont get bored after 2hours like before i never thought i would say this but good job hello games keep your updates coming and your game could actually become something really good for starters i you could add the ability to have several bases another thing bovering me is all the long cutscenes everytime i interact with an alien or a terminal trim it down for christ sake what i would recomend you do hello games is listen to your players and actually furfill your part and put the things gamers want in your game,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,foundation update simply put 3 months are literally not enough to develop implement test and release an update of this magnitude no matter how big your studio is anyone who has ever coded can understand this this strengthens my suspicions that nms 10 wasnt the game they planned to make in the first place and they got pushed by sony to an early release with everything that followed being a natural result i believe many of these features were under development already when the game first launched even now after 11 people still find more data files like the ground vehicles and the fourth alien race after the tinfoil wars hg have come out of their closet and the answer is good these are good programmers and they love their game for me this is good enough as for the content of the update survival mode is probably the best thing that ever happened to the game this is seriously difficult the freighters and base building are a nice way to add more playtime and giving a way to build a full economy maybe for the creative mode players its all about the screenshots but at survival having a steady safe income from your farm is very important other game changes like making buildings scarcer auto miners beacons and craftable save points help a lot with both immersion and cartography of an endless galaxy planets are now more diverse than ever with varying biomes per regions mountains and valleys are way more distinct unrealistic animal anatomies have been very toned down animal population size and behaviour is much better space battles are much better now skies are more populated and new interesting features like bounties are the icing on a very well baked cake overall every single change in this update has been very good granted the initial ground was on the low side as they basic game was very blunt this is no longer the case though the game is now lifted in a very good standard and if hg continue working with the same passion we will see an amazing game pretty soon as i was writing since the initial release the immense potential is still in the game,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,hello games are doing a good job at improving thier game if they keep it up no mans sky might even catch up to the expectations at some point of time the foundation update was a big step already,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,its a good game but defininetly needs more time to develop and is not worth 60,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,if you ignore the hype and the broken promises this game is actually quite good revolutionary even it gets repetitive after a while but i managed to get around 40 hours i enjoyed in this game before i got bored id say that is sufficient for a full priced game now the new update has arrived with some nice additions like base building and owning a freighter which adds several hours of fun more updates are coming in the future i really dont think this game deserves such harsh criticism its very enjoyable and fun to explore,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after the foundation update this game has really caught a second wind i enjoyed it before but only up to a point where it was just the same things over and over again this new update gives some new long term goals and cleans up a lot of the early problems with the game,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i dont usually review games unless i feel like theres a large distance between my impressions and the sentiment expressed by the majority of reviews at the time of this reivew steam lists the overall user reviews as mostly negative as my experience with nms has not been mostly negative i wanted to offer my 2 cents nms is a really cool exploration crafting game it is a super laid back experience that you can play for hours without getting fatigued or frustrated between bases and the atlas main quest theres plenty to keep you on a track if you want but you can jump off the main track and just do your own thing whenever you want i like this sort of opt in gameplay sometimes i want to build up my base or discover more of the game lore and sometimes i just want to explore nms can be a strcutured or free form as you want and you can switch off freely i dont like sandbox survival games and i dont really like crafting in games so i was super skeptical going into nms i didnt expect to enjoy it however after a while i got into the groove and really enjoy it once i started to understand what types of resources i needed and generally how to find them i started to really like it that said there are things i find aggrivating inventory space is really really really tight and the upgrades you craft must be equipped into inventory slots that means that everything you equip reduces spots for materials on top of this you have to keep a lot of basic materials on hand just for the core gameplay such as fuel because of this i find that im rarely able to craft things ive picked up dozens of recipies for upgrades but in 30 hours i think ive crafted 2 upgrades i really wish the game was more liberal in terms of the inventory space or that equipped upgrades didnt eat up inventory space additionally i wish there was some kind of resource locator or something how do you find what you need theres a scanner but it doesnt work too well there are upgrades for it but i dont have the space to equip it and i cant find the materials to build it the above criticisms of the core crafting and collecting mechanic could have been enough for me to shelve the game after 1012 hours however theres a lot here to keep me going first the base building in the foundations upgrade holds out hope that resource space and resource availability will be easier with the base plus the quests to build the base are fun and add some variety additionally the exploration is just plain fun when i get bored with a system or if i dont like the planets in a system i just take off to a new one theres always new and exciting things to see the planets varry quite a bit and no two are alike a relaxing gameplay distraction i really love is scanning and cataloging animals and plats when i dont feel like doing the resource grind i find a cool planet and go all national geographic on it finally there is some really cool action youll get interdicted by pirates if you have valuable cargo and will have to dogfight this was super aggrivating at first and i kep getting blown up but after buing an upgraded ship this has gotten a lot better space battles are really fun youll also find freighters being attacked and can save them so theres some variety in the space battles youll also find yourself fighting against the drones on the planets the agressiveness of the drones varries from planet to planet and planets with extremely valuable resources will often have very agressive drones youll find yourself fighting against them head on sometimes other times youll try to outwit and outrun them by hiding the drones mix up the action on the planets but they are also kind of weird fromn immersion perspective why are there these ai drones on every planet and why do they all look and act the same where do they come from who mantains them i have no idea it seems pretty weird lastly theres the action and drama of dealing with hostile planets nothing will get your blood going like being out of fuel on a 230c planet during a storm there are definitely things id like to see in furture updates a resource locator and some better balance for invetory would be nice more quests and npc interaction would great too the ability to build temporary shelters on hostile planets would be helpful variety in the space station designs would be great too cities or towns on some planets would increase immersion and a solar system map would be super helpful a more usable galaxy map would be nice too overall this is a really great game two of my favorite games are skyrim and elite dangerous nms feels a bit like a combination of the two if you enjoy space games exploration free roaming and a gameplay experience that can be as relaxed or as intense as you want then this is a great game,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,okay to start this off i was never part of that oversized hype train before release i have no need to bash the developers for what ever the general populace of steam has been bashing them for i like the vast open world exploration of the game even though it is single player the graphics dont have to be amazing to suite me but the price does need to change this is not triple a material in my honesty opinion with the foundation update the base building is pretty darn fun once you find that perfect planet with no crazy weather conditions spoiler alert the game will find this planet for you so dont bother looking just progress the game like normal the frieghters on this game are quite immpressive and very costly they made the currency in the game units acutally important now the three games modes are a nice killer way to choose how you want to play i bought the game solely because of the 3 game modes and base building and survival mode is unforgiving but the rewards are so much greater in space and on any planet when you find that resource your looking for in survival you cannot just run around and colelct everything and not pay attention to your surroundingsprotectionoxygen and even your ships fuel you acutally have to make careful decisions on weather or not to land on this planet because you can become easily stuck on the world with no way to get off until you find a fuel source so in short it feels to me as if im am in a very realistic survivala siutation some cons i do hope they look into though is the hostile space ship fights or frieghter fights in survival mode as it is extemely difficult to take on more than two ships on your own without proper upgrades to your ship which can easily make your lose all that hard earned items you foundmined i give this game a 810,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,the newest update was a real gamechanger and although the base game didnt give me what i want i cant help but appreciate the absolute massive content drop that just fell onto my lap looks like ill give this game one more go for those who dont know what 11 gave a few highlights are basebuilding farming system for plants that you find buildable save points mining nodes and beacons questing system for bases homeworlds fast travel to and from said homeworlds gigantic friegters that you can customize from the inside lighting overhaul major space combat tweaks new resources and new ways to gather them 3 gamemodes normalsurvivalcreative survival has been kicking my up and down the hills of my starting world new randomly generated elements like parts of ships and plants lovely addition to the already nice soundtrack bug fixes my goodness thats a lot and in such a short take after release and this is supposedly the smallest of the content updates to come if you can still take hello games word at it all of the above is a free update and has my attention the game isnt perfect but keep your mind open and your eyes up to see what else hello games will do so far they are listening and thats the most that i could ask from them,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i got pretty bummed when the game got out has most of us got but now after the update starting a survival campaign it took me 2 god damn hours to get out of the first planet because i had to run to shade every minute or so high temperature planet and no means of getting thamium and zinc meant i had almost no life support and had to hide in caves and explore them for a while to get everything i needed the night was amazing because i could get stuff done actually it felt challenging i loved every minute hello games made a step in the right direction i will never forget what they have done but i can forgive them not now but this looks promising keep it up,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,the foundation update has really saved this game for me not only is survival planetside much more challenging but i feel like i have more goals to work towards during gameplay if you gave up shortly after initial release give no mans sky another try now,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,im not one to review games ever but i believe this game deserves a little credit for what it is and not blame for what it isnt lets keep it fairly succinct the game on release was lackluster a large group of people believed that this was supposed to be the game to end all games and when you drink that koolaid youe always in line for disappointment yes the developers did make comments and show clips to suggest certain features that didnt appear on launch multiplayer amphibious ships freighters base building etc however they chose to hint at things instead of promising them outrightso that when they didnt appear in the game people felt duped including myself to a certain extent without splitting hairs too far it was a shady practice by a bunch of guys that are fairly new to the market and i think theyve began to learn their lesson though time will ultimately tell why do i believe theyve learned their lesson because they didnt abandon the game though the majority of players were absolutely destroying their game their company and ultimately the reputation of both instead of making grandiose promises they buckled down and fixed the major issues not long after launch instead of trying to deflect comments that they took everyones money and left they were adding a huge update one that they consider small by adding new features to the game that make it look nicer run smoother and much more interesting to play and explore on that topic update 11 is really nice it adds freighters and base building to the game along with tons of improvements new resources items upgrades etc the hellogames team calls it the first of many but instead of making promises it seems they are opting to just deliver a welcome suprise occasionally which i appreciate in light of how they started there are undoubtibly plenty of people who will still be angry and will add negative reviews even after this update these arent all necessarily baseless but its important to differentiate between people who dont enjoy the game as it stands right now and people who feel that they got duped and will never be happy some people would make you think that this game was a major life purchase like they bought a car without an engine its a standard priced game divide it by the number of hours the reviewers have in it and tell me if you can do better with other forms of entertainmentif you can dont buy it however i think its an interesting space exploration game with some really incredible randomly generated planets animals lifeforms ships etc i love finding new planets and being blown away by the complexity and beauty my gut and this patch named foundations suggests to me that were moving towards a truly multiplayer experience how that shapes up will come with time regardless of where it goes its fun to play now is it worth full price maybe nothowever i bought this game at full price for myself and my friends and am now happy that i did as i look forward to seeing where it goes,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,update is a good start to fix an okay game to be a great one,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,with the 11 update it is a sign of huge improvement i enjoyed the game before now it can only get better,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,no mans sky has been a weird experience seen by many as a promising game it quickly got consumed by its own hype pushing even the developers and sony to promise heaven this lead to many things from the false marketing of maybe planned but finally undelivered promises over the radio silence and bad customer treatment up to the outrageous triple a price tag on the unfinished product upon release but aside of that history and in light of the new foundation update with which hello games delivers on their promise of ongoing free updates to see their promised game realized one day we should look at the game itself not what it could be or might be in the future but what it has become and by no means is it a bad game no mans skys vanilla mode which is still an option in the new foundation update was easy once you got the rough ideas of the game down you had no problems gathering resources or surviving it was just an exploration game with a sandbox universe far too big for its content quickly one saw that each planet was just a small number of variants that decided to randomly litter the overworld with monoliths to learn the language plants and especially structures they had no coherence or sense to them in space you often found the same cookiecutter setting with the same aliens and only slightly changed price tags sometimes you even saw the same alien three times not by design but by actual identity the cloning bug the achievements were generally easy to do aside of the planet exploration of species or the survival achievement the main reason was the tedious search for the last alien that spawns as a rarity or the fact you had to survive 30 sol in one sitting on a dangerous planet it was not accumulative the vanilla version of no mans sky stands as a warning too high expectations and the urge to be swept up in hype forced an indi studio to oversell their own game and vision and they paid a terrible pr price for it while one can point the blame here solely on sean murray and sony one has to ask what the other developers thought today we see their work which not only introduces crews building diversity and an actual survivor mode it also offers new variety to a previously stale game no mans sky was delayed prior to release to finish features it was still released without them today we might actually see the original idea of nms in its 10 juvenile version just with the label of being 11 in truth this game never deserved the triple a pricetag it might not even deserve it now but nms is not the villian that people have branded it recently it is just another indi game that was overhyped if you see nms at a reasonable discount or for below 30 bucks compared to its 60 at release this game definetly deserves to be explored and with many people coming before you you might actually be able to trace their steps as they weathered the initial experience during the games initial downfall ingame stories standing in their own right in light of the recent awards i say give this villian a well deserved hug in the sea of survival and exploration games nms still remains a rarity to be enjoyed,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,originally a complete flop on launch went silent for 3 months now they have come out and released a massive update might not be worth it to everyone but its a sign of good things to come,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after 11 i can finally say that i like where this game is going check it out its finally worth it knowing that more updates are to come,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,ive given this game a thumbs up recommendation but only if you read my full review and know what you are getting into you have to look at this as an early access survival game similar to subnautica or the forest only this one was advertised as a finished product and sold for 60 the foundation update is out and it actually adds quite a bit of content however similar to some survival games still in early development it has also changed direction for me personally the original release was too easy and had no goals the promised progression in difficulty as you head toward the center of the galaxy was apparently absent meaning there was no real incentive to grind out money and upgrade your ship with this update we have a new survival mode in which the difficulty forces you to actually think about the game systems and plan your actions quite hard at first but as you learn how the game works and get better is is very rewarding and gives you a greater incentive to upgrade your various systems furthermore you now have new resources and schematics along with base building and related goals in the form of mini quests and finally a larger end game goal of purchasing a freighter which gives incentive to make lots of credits however the game is far from perfect and many of the original promises have not been addressed some may come in further patches some may never happen including things like multiplayer this is all unknown and no road map for development has been laid out also if you dont like grinding and resource gathering or survival games in general this patch doesnt change those core concepts even if you do like survival type games there are others to choose from that are further along and have better communication with their player base and also are cheaper like subnautica but what those other survival games dont allow me to do is survive as a space explorer with a challenging survival mode game balancing changes a home base with storage and creative options new shortcut bar improved visuals i am personally having a lot of fun now and happy with the direction the game is taking however if you are on the fence and still undecided i would recommend you wait until it is on sale and maybe wait a few more months to see what other future patches bring,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,nms foundation 1010 esp survial,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,the update made this game alot better the future is looking brighter warning only purchase if you have the unnatural ability to think for your self,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,i have not played it until the foundation update and what i am seeing is what i was expecting actually much better than the first release critics describe probably because of the gameplay changes on the update there are groups ships flying through the planets there are dinosaurkind creatures there is no multiplayer though but still it is keeping me very engaged the gameplay feels very balanced making you progress and earn more units and better upgrades while keeping you wanting more and exploring new planets and settlements i do think it is worth it,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,im changing my review of the game to positive since the game is way more enjoyable after recent patches amp uppdates,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,that time when they add more content to the game in 90 days than in the 4 years it took to make it but seriously if these updates continue delivering then we might just get the game we wanted,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after 11 update can recommend prior nope,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,much better game now the foundation update has added purpose reason and direction to the for those who want to find a nice or challenging place to settle in for a while i would recommend those who have stopped playing but still own the game to give it another go its more than pure exploration now,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,after the 11 patch it went from a mildly decent game not deserving of overwhelmingly negative reviews probably a 55 10 to a good game 810 the patch optimized the game running it in a 3 year old laptop below minimum specs so far 0 crashes added more variety and added something similar to questlines given by the recruited staff in your base also the game was rebalanced to be more challenging even in normal mode suddenly there are no plutonium deposits everywhere and you really feel some stress to keep managing your stocks a con is the ui that is still too consoley and missing the lowflight mod that became essential in the previous version cant wait for future updates but i am already impressed by the current state of the game,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,enjoying it much more than i expected given the bad reviews the base building and quests are a lot of fun bought it thinking it was a sort of spacezoo sim where you could see lots of different interesting creatures but theyre the least interesting part of the game as they just look like a bunch of cartoon dinosaurs could do without the interactivitystopping letterboxing on every achievement milestone fps varies from 25 60 which is extremely annoying but not enough to stop me from playing,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,like so many people i was disappointed and wanted my money back when this game released i have put a lot of money into another game star citizen and i am happy with the amount i have sunk into it and intially compared to the 60 i spent on no mans sky i was very angry with the loss of the 60 bucks but now i dont feel it was a loss steam refused me and i am now glad they did the thing with this game and the newest foundation patch is i am enjoying it beyond the initial shine building bases is nothing new in a spacesandboxexploration game but the way they are built and the tools involved are seamless and intuitive the freighter aspect is so far awesome i dont own one yet but i have found a gek freighter now a few times that resembles a star destroyer check out my page for a public screen shot of one the korvax shares similarities to the nebulonb frigate but these are only a few of the model types i have seen and rescued the cost so far is just under 10 mil for around a 15 slot freighter and i will be watching for more the new teleporter is great and easier way to get back to the base you built without frantically trying to use the warp nav system my hope is that hello games doesnt stop here they can learn a lot from another developer eleon studios maker of empyrion they are active vocal and most of all listen to the community love your enemies for they tell you your faults benjamin franklin,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,i love the game after the 11 patch survival mode makes me feel like the king of the universe when i accomplish in something it aint easy and its not for people that get frustrated easily this game is for openminded explorers,1,1
275850,No Man's Sky,im giving this a positive review because after months of this game being slammed and being one of the more hated games on steam instead of breaking up or moving to a new game the devs seem to be actually trying to remedy their mistake,1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,this game isnt reallly as bad as most people are making out its just not worth a triple a price tag its quite a relaxing and fun game to play and the foundation update has added some other cool stuff aswell as the base building,1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,positive the most welloptimized pc game i have ever played on my system this runs on maximum settings at a steady high frame rate and in nearly 200 hours of gameplay never once has it stuttered noticeably dropped in frame rate or had a single screen tear also one of the best looking games ive ever laid eyes on transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are seamless and everything has a highly cinematic sheen to it clean intuitive interface and controls whether youre on foot horseback or riding in a mech everything is fluid and precise i dont think ive ever accidentally done something i didnt mean to in terms of character control the stealth gameplay is very well executed and the enemy ai is generally good despite some minor hiccups variety and interactivity are unmatched you can approach any given scenario pretty much however you want charging in guns blazing will almost always get you killed but thats an option want to steal a tank and ride it into battle thats an option command your horse to defecate do it on the road to cause enemy vehicles to swerve out of control thats an option if you have say enemy communication satellites to destroy you can go tactical by sneaking in at night in a stealth suit with a silenced tranquilizer pistol and planting c4 to detonate from a distance remaining undetected you can also choose to destroy the satellites with a rocket or grenade launcher or ride in on a mech and use its customizable onboard weapons or never even leave your helicopter simply fly above the site and mow down enemies and the satellites using its mounted minigun veterans of the series will be happy to know that the cardboard box also makes a return and now you can distract enemies by taping posters of models on the side of it or use it to slide down hilly areas for up to hundreds of feet the games world is a big playground and simply wandering around in it experimenting with what you can do is supremely satisfying there is a section in which you develop new items by using the games fictional currency you will need to raise certain factions of your army to specific levels as well as go hunting for military experts and resources in the field to unlock or level up these weapons amp gadgets this gives you a more customizable experience as you choose what to unlock and when youll want a decent weapon in each category but if youre more of a close quarters gunman you can concentrate on upgrading the shotguns or smgs first likewise if you prefer fighting at a distance there are sniper amp assault rifles aplenty later in the game you earn the option to modify each weapon for an even more personal experience audio is outstanding and you can use it to your advantage judging the direction and proximity of enemy footsteps or vehicles for instance among many other collectible items youll find cassette tapes littered all over the place many of them pop songs from the 80s including david bowie the cure and joy division which give the game even more of a sense of period and setting its also bizarrely satisfying to hear something like ahas take on me while interrogating an enemy pushing a knife through his chest then opening fire on a squad of child labor profiteers negative repetition there are over 150 side ops but theyre almost entirely comprised of groups of missions in which you do the exact same thing extract a hostage destroy an artillery unit or communications outpost clear a minefield only in different places some main missions though longer and more complex are guilty of this too and there are too few that truly progress the plot there are only two maps sovietoccupied afghanistan all desert and civil wartorn central africa mostly marshlands and some forests neither contain enough interior settings which is where metal gear solid thrives i feel and while they are large a lot of it looks the same and it wont take very long before youve explored both maps in their entirety mother base repeats so many textures and designs that it isnt worth exploring beyond looking at your animal conservatory featuring animals youve trapped in the field or gathering various collectibles hidden around this combined with the redundant nature of the missions adds to the sense of repetition in mgsv hideo hideo kojima kojima hes sort of like the george lucas of videogames mgs1 is one of the best games ever made and mgs3 is arguably the gem of the series his empire strikes back if you will but the series characters and overarching story are eccentric amp wacky at best and randomly silly amp stupid at worst mgsvs possibly most of all and theres nobody to tell him no save konami and only after he cost them too much money mgsv is rife with plot holes including a gaping one due to budget cuts that prevented kojimas team from finishing the final mission which wouldve brought closure to all the storylines left hanging and properly tied the game into the chronology of the series leading into metal gear 1 also at the beginning and end of every mission he reminds us that this is his game in the form of cinematic credits which accentuate his company and status he even makes a cameo in the game as himself again he did this in the exact same context in ground zeroes the game may as well be called hideo kojimas metal gear solid v neutral the story and particularly the ending which naturally polarized players i thought the plot had some great moments but that they were too far and few in between it has noticeably shorter and fewer cutscenes than previous mgs games which depending on the player can be good or bad the rpgesque micromanagement that comes in the form of leveling up mother base outer heaven from metal gear and your home when youre not gallivanting around afghanistan and africa as you extract more soldiers and resources from the field youll start to build more platforms and an army to train and deploy on offscreen missions with each soldier possessing different skills and traits some may find this fun and a nice distraction from the main game others an unnecessary bloated annoyance you can choose to ignore it to a certain extent but you will need to level up specific squads in order to unlock some important upgrades the difficulty in some missions can be downright brutal and it doesnt help that the checkpoint system is unforgiving boss fights of which there are significantly fewer than in previous mgs titles will start you over entirely if you die and you can lose a lot of time in missions if you get very far but are spotted and killed theres no manual save of any kind when youre in a mission only checkpoints far and few in between you need to be smart tactical and patient and not treat this like a typical shooter or 3rd person action game if youre going to survive especially early on this has very little in common with other games in the series 95 of it is spent in the open its much lighter overall on plot and dialogue and the nature of its stealth gameplay has changed dramatically by setting it almost entirely outdoors as opposed to the corridorstyle settings native to the series verdict while it may not be the swan song the series deserves in terms of plot the phantom pain is arguably the most fun mgs game with the most player freedom while it has some glaring plotrelated problems theyre overlookable considering this is one of the best stealth amp actionadventure games ever made its also unique as stealth games go because of how the those aspects operate in an open world setting veterans and new players alike are in for a real treat with this highly recommended,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,since i now have 100 i guess its time to review this game its damn incredible the gameplay is pretty much flawless in my 300 hours of playtime i havent found a single bug well except an aidriven truck trying to do some offroading with hilarious results the ai is really smart able to wipe you out if you arent careful they use teamwork and dont aim like stormtroopers or cheaters being nicely in the middle the buddy system is great and each of snakes companions feels like it has a purpose with ddog being my personal favourite theres a buddy for every playstyle as long as you develop the right equipment speaking of development this game has a ridiculous amount of weapons and items to develop and even after getting 100 i still have new guns and upgrades to try out they dont count to 100 as for the story its a strange one and it has a lot of different opinions i do agree with the majority saying that skull face isnt a massively interesting villain mainly due to the fact that he barely makes an appearance until later on endgame spoilers the final plot twist was pretty good too as i have a nice little idea on what kojima meant by it but its too long to fully explain basically i thought he wanted us to be a victim of big boss antagonism rather than play as him ourselves as for the graphics the game looks excellent with the fox engine keeping the game running at a smooth 5060fps and my pc isnt exactly the best around the sound and music is also incredible with the music ranging from the calming flutes of afghanistan to the pounding intense drums of a combat alert in africa the soundtrack also accompanies the mood brilliantly so do i recommend this game absolutely i almost cant fault it and its everything it was hyped up to be easily game of the year contender,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,what a weird game the gameplay itself is stellar and if youre a fan of the stealth genre youve probably played this one already its basically a highbudget remake of peace walker on the other hand it has the weakest plotstory of all metal gear solid games its clearly unfinished and with the current situation at konami its not likely well see an updated rerelease like substance or subsistence,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,game is amazing the graphics the story the gameplay i am just really amazed of what they created from what ive seen the pc version is really great optimized running with a 970 and i5 4670k maxed out at 60 fps with no frame drops if you really like open world stealth action games just buy it and i am sure you wont regret it the only problem with the game might be that the km controls are not so great but i expect most people are using xbox 360 controllers like myself so thats the only concern that i have also i have finished chapter 1 and i only have 1 game completion so imagine that the amount of hours you could get out of this game would be more than 100 at least 1010,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,call me crazybut i think this game was made by some sexy beast named hideo kojima the story takes place after the events of ground zeroes 9 years to be precise as your main character punished venom snake has been in a coma and is now on a hell driven odyssey to get his revenge so gameplay wise you go on a series of missions accessing via idroid in which snake will do mainly extraction or assassination missions all which is at your expense of how you play the game you can either go in guns blazing and get killed within seconds or you can go in and be the silent hero and sneak past guards enemy mechs snipers the whole mile with a whole arsenal of weapons that you can put people to sleep with darts or destroy everyone with a rpg the enemy ai is well improved as it will take skill to get passed you can also call on your allies to even distract some of the attention caused like helicopters your animal or human companions to even help if you are also new to the mgs series do not worry because if you fail the missions a few times which of course i did on a few you will get a chicken hat that either reduces the enemies spot target to half or even the baby chicken hat which basically makes you a ghost through the missions plenty of other side op missions to do as well you can also you can of course upgrade your weapons tools base in which you can control teams and send them on missions to expand your base being open world as well you also get vehicles to traverse around afghanistans rocky deserts whether it will be by horseback dwalker or other means of transportation tons of great characters and a great line of voice actors that really made the character as kiefer sutherland this time plays snake controls are smoothe and responsive when you play as snake only problem i had was on certain vehicles like the dwalker where on those controls i felt like a moron trying to be stealthy as i was roller skating my way while bumping into obstacles trying to reach the next mission nothing serious there but sometimes the controls can get frustrating when you are spotted and trying to hide again musical score is beautiful graphics are amazing no reason to go into detail on that as always you guys would i recommend it that is a definate yes its metal gear solid go and buy itlike now story is decent classic and awesome characters fun gameplay that will last hours on end because i have barely scratched the surface with this one as it provides so much more in game than what i could explain i just had to throw in my opinion on this one much love much recommendation,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,after gaming for over 20 years first starting on a snes controller in the early 90s i am giving my first gaming review it is fitting that the first review i write is the latest of the franchise that i first fell in love with on ps1 the original metal gear solid having played and finished all of the metal gear franchise i can safely assume that i could regard myself as somewhat of a mg seasoned expert and bottom line up front bluf hideo kojima has once again proven that he can easy bring aaa games to the field in a seemingly effortless fashion mgsv the phantom pain is a visually pleasing and exciting adventure with a story line that sheds new light on the events of outer heaven and shadow moses true to the franchise stealth is a big part of the game but not vital the option to go guns in blazing is there for the times you just get too fed up of failing to infiltrate an enemy base and want to progress the combat mechanics of the game are easy to understand and adapt to even for beginners with varying scales of difficulty these mechanics are implemented into a very successful multiplayer mode which focuses on both team death match and objective style missions campaign progression introduces multiple new systems of gameplay all the way until the final missions and although the story is quite linear there is a extreme level of freedom in regard to choices each choice has a consequence some of which are small and more like an easter egg while others can affect events later in the game they are not permanent though all choices can be overturned by replaying particular missions to achieve desired effect the map size is incredibly large which can take a substantial amount of time to cross on foot so there are a variety of vehicles that can be driven across the landscape the open environment is fantastic for planning and executing missions and the amazing and picturesque graphics feed the desire for those who like to explore riding along on horseback with a rocket launcher in hand shooting at soviet t72 tanks whilst listing to a great soundtrack of 80s hits from your sony walkman is one of the pure gems of this game the story like all metal gear games is the best part of the game from those that know the background of naked snake and his transformation to big boss will know the heartfelt detail that was put in to developing individual characters and giving them real human emotion to bring out that of the player favourites of the series like revolver ocelot and kaz miller make a big appearance in the games story along with some new characters like skull face and quiet which players will come to appreciate metal gear solid v the phantom pain is a master piece and deserves the respect that each of the franchise receives it is an amazing story that will make you think about warfare and human desire for retribution this game is one of the best for 2015 and should remain at the top for quite some time i give mgsv the phantom pain the following ratings 1010 story 1010 gameplay 9510 graphics 910 soundtrack 910 multiplayer 9510 overall this game is well suited for those that enjoy the following franchises metal gear solid splinter cell hitman grand theft auto max payne and mafia,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,the last mgs game i played was mgs guns of the patriots on ps3 that game was amazing having played this game amp not knowing much about it before hand nor did i play ground zero ive got to say that this is probably the greatest stealth game made the game not only looks beautiful amp is well optimised running at a stable 60fps 2560 x 1440 on a gtx 970 but is a pleasure to play there are tons of missions and side missions for you to immerse yourself in as well as a base building mechanic which can be quite time consuming on its own i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a rich single player experince who is willing to invest quite a few hours into the game in order to fully experince it in additon to the rich story driven single player missions there is also a multiplayer aspect to the game in which players can attackdefend their base or another players mother base,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,ive been following this game series for around 20 years ive yet to been let down by a single entry if you are on the fence because this is pc let me tell you this isnt just a port its amazing im around 54 hours in and its just getting more fun the mouse and keyboard controls and responsive and precise now with a mouse i feel like more of a boss than ever before thanks to easy aiming on the other hand if you arnt one for cutscenes and being sneaky this probably isnt for you please try all the other games in the series if you enjoyed this one the others are more linear but razor focused on story progression this one is about rebuilding from scratch less about one misson of couse kojima has told a beautiful underlying story deep and full of reflection 1010 would get tattooed on skin,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,metal gear solid v the phantom pain is an open world action adventure stealth based game developed by kojima productions and published by konami releasing on pc ps3 ps4 xbox 360 and xbox one in september 2015 this has been touted as the final instalment in the metal gear series however it is the eleventh game to come out since the franchise started this is a prequel to the original metal gear solid game that was released way back in 1987 we all pretty much know what to expect from a metal gear solid game by now but for those that dont mgs is a stealth based game where you play in third person controlling big boss phantom pain is an open world environment which is a little different to how previous titles in the series have gone but it is a nice change you sneak from point to point avoiding guards search lights and patrols whilst training to remain undetected you are always encouraged to try and progress through the game by being as lethal as possible so you are equipped with a tranquilizer dart from the beginning of the game phantom pain also includes a basebuilding element which allows you to develop weapons and items for yourself you are able to recruit enemy soldiers to work in your base as well which is definitely a nice touch phantom pain also has a new daynight cycle added in as well which means you can plan certain activities for different times of the day such as infiltrating a base is easier at night due to the lack of light it is so in depth that you are able to study the patrol paths of guards for certain times of the day and even the shifts of the guards giving you all that extra couple of seconds to sneak in unnoticed graphically phantom pain is just breath taking obviously i couldnt play at 4k but even a mere resolution of 1440p it just looks gorgeous the near life like look to this game is honestly one of the best looking games to ever be made the pc version puts the console versions to shame and by a large scale as well the crispness of all the modelling is perfect not to mention the stellar animation of everything and anything i am struggling to find words to describe just how good this game is in this department we have come to know that mgs games have pretty epic sound tracks too and phantom pain is no different being produced by a four time mgs veteran harry gregsonwilliams makes a return throughout the game you are able to find collectable cassette tapes which you can play during game play of the extracts of the soundtrack itself phantom pain is only tricky if you go in all gunsblazing this type of game you have to plan your steps methodically and put your plan in place before you move i did have to refer to a walkthrough at times to give me an insight on how to progress on some quests and areas but the majority of the time you can work it out for yourself with ease if you just pay attention the games prologue which acts as a tutorial system does well to introduce a lot of the games core mechanics to any new players too the game has taken me just over 50 hours to complete the main story with a good portion of side missions there are roughly 150 side missions to complete and i would highly recommend people try do as many as possible not only does it add hours and hours of content but the rewards you reap from them are far from useless somehow the game for me was technically sound i was at least expecting some bugs and issues given that it is a vast open world game but i had no problems at all i played with keyboard and mouse and was surprised at how well it controlled normally i play third person games with a gamepad but i expected precision to be key so of course the mouse makes that the perfect tool for the job my conclusion on metal gear solid v the phantom pain is that it is a near enough perfect game with no flaws from what i can see i loved it from start to finish and i really will be replaying the game at least one more time at a future date just because it is a masterpiece of a game people may think the retail price of 4599 is high whilst it is high you are going to be getting a game with potentially hundreds of hours of content and easily the best game to come out of the metal gear solid series toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6 this is a must play if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up if you would also like to follow my reviews more easily be sure to join my group by clicking here,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,about welcome to the world of metal gear where the world history took a very weird twist already in 1950s mgs5 takes place in 1980s you play as big boss who awakes from a coma after 9 years the game fits surprisingly well into the timeline it closes the whole storyline and finally creates one solid line of a story the story is complete finally from metal gear solid 3 to metal gear solid 4 the gameplay is very repetitive it almost feels like the game caught an assassins creed syndrome but its not that bad at all its still one of the best tactical stealth action games i have ever played the story is kinda missing from this one but that was expected because kojima was very limited towards the end of the game second chapter is very unfinished and contains only minority of main missions rest of the chapters are just recycled mission from chapter 1 which is very sad gameplay gameplay is very good responsive and feels just right both on the keyboard and a controller i play my game on the keyboard and im more than happy with it easy to control and fun to play performance this game literally runs on a cardboard box my game was played on a 2 years old laptop with 4gb ram i3 and gt740m runs more than good which surprised me the most this game is very well optimized is it good for new mgs fans definitely you are not losing much by starting with this game if you plan to play other games it links to the past and to the future simultaneously you will learn bits from both timelines and you can get to other games later for me this game would be 810 because of q spectacular gameplay repetitivness and lack of cutscenes and story,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,for story continuity you must play ground zeroes first else you wil be confused by a few aspects of the story having played this from release day until a recently i freakin loved this game it delivers in every department that i expect a metal gear solid game to showcase action stealth crazyness insanity chaos laughter in the story department it plugs up all the gaps that has plagued the series it all makes metal gear sense gameplay i love it grinding was a pure pleasure stealthing was my main mode of playing hardly ever killed anyone fultoning is my most used item tranquilizer gun is my weapon of choice fun fun fun is it worth us60 as of 04272016 a very close no even i didnt pay that much on release paid us40 even with the open world nature of the game it almost justifies the price despite the many hours i have poured into playing the game there is only one thing i didnt like about it filler missions these happen towards the end of the missions list and are not mandatory to finish the story but for someone who wants more metal gear it got on my nerves it reintroduces the missions you did ages before but with some changes i wont mention anymore for any person who loves stealth games this is the one to get a stealth game in an almost open world environment this is the business,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,if you are looking for the perfect openworld game to accompany a months long existential depression kojimas ultimate metal gear entry will not disappoint as you wander aimlessly through one of two equally dreary environments you will have ample time to ponder your place in the universe as snake similarly struggles to find any cohesive narrative or meaning in this digital masterpiece toil furiously to upgrade your weapons bolster your defenses and rebuild your mercenary empire none of your staff will notice or credit you for any of it there is no reward for your endless labors and yet you will discover a sort of nietzschean dignity to the struggle and through it perhaps see reflected the pointless beauty of your own continued existence 1010 would darkly ruminate again,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,my experience with mgsv tpp is unfortunately mixedthe gameplay itself is awesome and its a must have for fans of the stealth genre but this comes at a great costmsg tpp has the weakest story of all the metal gear solid games imoif you are familiar with peace walker you can consider this a highbudget clone with superior gameplay and more shallow plot final verdict good as a game bad as a mgtakes a solid no pun intended 810,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,a very solid experience great gameplay and well optimized kept me waiting but was worth the wait go ahead n get it edit there seems to be an issue with amd phenom right now but im sure itll be addressed in a future patch edit 2 there has been a patch released for the cpus affected and it is found under the betas tab of properties,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,contains very subtle spoilers my late review youve heard the hype youve heard the from the hideo kojima lovers see my mgsgz review for my thoughts on him and youve heard from the konami haters i couldnt care less about them either now hear an impartial review from a true casual gamer firstly i love it and cant recommend it enough but to give some insight on how it plays its a desert island game if you were stuck on an island with nothing but a pc and coconuts for eternity this game would keep you occupied for a fair bit in typical mgs style the plot is completely out there nothing really makes a lot of sense and you dont really know why you are doing a lot of what you are doing without any spoilers basically after the events of mgsgz you are looking for revenge but you end up unearthing a couple of other major plot lines along the way which are really good actually better than the main plot imo its certainly entertaining cut scene rich and more war symbolism than you can shake a nuclear warhead at the voice acting is great the characters are interesting if sometimes a little cringe i found the ending quite unsatisfying but the ending isnt the end of playing i got over it there is a constant air of seriousness about the plot but its mixed with plain weirdness and humour you will have all seen the videos of sheep being fultoned into the air hiding in a cardboard box with a hot chick on the front of it or using a water pistol to subdue a solider well the same game also contains the horrors of child soldiers bombs stitched into peoples stomachs drs and nurses being murdered by machineguns patients shot in the head in whilst they sleep inches from you and a virus that has sickening effects on people depending on the language they speak so yeah its got funny and at the same time it hasnt the choice given to the player straight after the prologue is huge you embark on a journey of plot main and side missions which unlock as you go but you can generally chose which order to complete the few you get at a time on some occasions you are forced into plot missions all this is done through the idroid which is basically a fictional 80s smartphone with a really crap interface the idroid interface is perhaps my only real problem with the game as a whole as being a loyal keyboard mouse user its the only part of the game you can see is still consoleified you do end up becoming quite quick on the idroid though in each mission unless specified you can go all out action or sneaking or a bit of both i found it plays a bit like a splinter cell conviction in terms of combat and sneaking enemies try and flank your last known position etc same trappings as all these 3rd person cover games you end up cover sticking to walls you dont want to or running over cover when you wanted to go behind when the game opens up a bit more you can take a buddy on missions with you too choose from a dog a horse a robot or the half naked woman sniper each have different pros and depending on your play style youll end up taking each one eventually the missions replayability is very clever there are conflicting challenge tasks in each mission which means you would have to play them a few times differently to achieve them all some reviewers i note dont like this idea of repetition but i do as well as this there are online challenges that change every now and then that give you bonuses to your online mgstpp profile i would argue there are only really 31 plot and main missions then there are extreme or variant versions of the same missions over again how the game deals with this is a tad annoying as it sort of leads the player to believe there is more when in fact you quickly realise oh its the same again again i dont really mind replaying the same mission especially if its an extreme variant such as total stealth but the way its presented to the player is a bit cheeky there are a bucketload of side missions to complete a lot of these repeat the same tasks but given the choice of approach given to the player i forgave this i had loads of fun completing all the side missions in all different ways all the missions are detailed and each has a lot of depth things are going on in the missions you dont notice the first time second time or even the fifth time playing them and the game encourages you to replay the mission to discover these little details there are situations where you can complete missions earlier because you know where the objective is before you would normally know and there is even dialogue in the game that notes this as you play you develop better kit which again leads to replaying old missions with better kit the development of kit is extensive there is an immense amount of guns and gear to develop and customise you must develop your base of operations and buddy kits too there is also a staff game mechanic where you collect soldiers for your own personal army each staff member have different skills like support combat medical etc i really like this part of the game but unfortunately its let down by the crappy idroid interface and it makes moving staff around your base very cumbersome and off putting to summerise the single player side it is an epic journey with a breadth of things to complete not just the missions themselves but the challenges collecting collectables like tapes blueprints animals scouting out staff developing your base and gear you can continue to do this for a very long time too the single player alone makes the game brilliant enough for me then there is online mgstpp there are two halves to online mode as i see it there is the vs mode and fob mode i didnt think there was enough to the vs multiplayer strain and i think its because as a shooter mgstpp is pretty standard in terms of its shooty mechanics there isnt anything new or groundbreaking about it or nothing that makes it unique other than it being mgs its also a grinding unlock type system which is off putting after playing a few rounds i realised that i might as well play go play my usual favoured shooter because im better at it and its better at doing it the fob mode is the more interesting online mode fob is your forward operating base which is just like your single player base but every player who plays mgstpp single player eventually gets one you develop this base too you can raid other players bases and steal resources and staff from them how you do this is up to you but the main options seem to be by killing stealing or infiltrating the base depending on what you want you start your raid from an individual platform for instance infiltrating the medical platform should get you some good medical staff but if you wanted resources you could go to the support platform and steal a load of crates and then just evac out if you are discovered on another players fob base and theyre online they can join the base and defend it this nowadays invariably never happens as the rush of the game has passed and the number of online players is much lower most bases ive come across the players have moved on and are playing something else which makes raiding much about the resource stealing other players can retaliate later on your base but only if you were discovered on their fob if you sneak in undetected you basically get away with it there is plenty more i could cover but i think that gives anyone reading a good view of what the game plays like,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,working great i love this game first i wanted to address the console controls issue it does exist but its not as bad as you might think yes there are some control cues that dont use keyboard mouse it says use left stick to walk and right stick to look but you can figure that out all other control prompts are fine and indicate correct keyboard keys so dont panic now the actual game mgs5tpp offers a huge amount of freedom customisation replayable missions excellent movies and storytelling and fun gameplay the scope of this game is really quite amazing you can manage and upgrade a base research hundreds of items and collect wildlife plants resources vehicles objects and soldiers to use missions allow for multiple entry points freedom of movement and let you choose how you want to complete them in true metal gear solid style the plot characters and gameplay are excellent this is one of the best games ive ever played highly recommended,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,zeeks solid review spoiler free i normally dont do serious reviews but ill go ahead and try this game is kojima productions at its best the second coming of my personal favorite metal gear solid 2 pros patches up retcons from the msx games multiple endings got rid of the horrid stealth ring system and removed camo index new and unique stealth gameplay amazing engine well opitimized the only time i lost 60 fps was when i saw electricity an extreme amount of content and story length i could play this game for the rest of my life especially since i was able to put 30 hours into ground zeroes biggest complaint i hear about this game is the lack of cutscenes the story is mostly told with cassette tapes i look at this as a pro i understand why people miss the sizable cutscenes because thats something the series is known for story for people who want it cons the final mission of the game was removed and was a very important ending rare but got spotted through walls a couple times if you are shooting a rpg and a bird flys by you you will die reused missions for act 2 forgivable but still annoying not many memorable quotes not many boss fights some boss fights were underwhelming microtransactions im normally against dlc and im definitely against supporting konami but id really like to see the final mission either added to the game as a patch or more likely dlc kojimas final metal gear and arguably one of his best 1010 mrrroow,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,unfortunately the games unfinished theres been a pretty decent amount of cut content from what i and others can piece together the game has two chapters the first one being titled revenge and the second being titled race im limiting myself here by not trying to spoil anything but lets just say the story seems to fall apart and crumble in the latter half metal gear solid vs story is like a lost sheep trying to carve a path and find its way in doing so it doesnt exactly know what its well doing i can only lead myself to believe that kojima and konamis conflict played a major role in the outcome of the game if you play through this game and actually attempt to get wrapped up in the lore you will undoubtedly feel like somethings missing kojima wanted to hit controversial topics and taboos but the overall direction tone and way the story is set up makes it seem less significant than intended certain things were left in as if they were going to have some significance and buildup and while it seemed as such they ended up having quite literally no significance at all i really want to give an example here so i dont have to have a hard time explaining but you know spoilers towards the end plot points are just left in the air but theyre never actually tied up due to cut content theres an entire mission that was supposed to wrap up a certain plot point but that was unsurprisingly cut from the game the saddest part is that the cut content people have managed to find is probably not even all of the cut content that exists in the end this game could have been so much more storywise the ambition is there the themes are there the plot points are there but theyre just left hanging with that said heres hoping kojima has better success in the future wouldnt want to see his creative talent and potential go to waste you are the man who trolled the world so why did i give this game a thumbs up well i wish there was a sideways thumb option if you arent big on mgss lore to begin with or dont play these kinds of games for the story regardless this is still a fantastic game the gameplay is superb controls are honestly as good as you can get in an openworld stealth game from fultoning soldiers on the field and recruiting them to join your diamond dogs pmc to going online and raiding other peoples forward operating bases i really am shocked at what this game has to offer in the gameplay department theres so many different things to do but i wont go into detail as ive already said enough probably hell i have just about 100 hours on record as of this review just because i find the gameplay always dragging me back for more all i can say is if you can overlook the story and play the game for what it is this game is amazing however being a big mgs fan and getting sucked into the lore this story left me in a bit of pain not just any pain a phantom pain if you already beat the game i highly suggest checking these videos out they pretty much sum up my thoughts exactly spoiler alert of course youtube video mgsv the phantom pains cut ending and abandoned ideas lost in conceptnbsp,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,is mgsv a perfect game what does it mean to be a perfect game,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,this is one of the best video games i have ever played and the most disappointing the gameplay is unmatched and a ton of fun but its plot is very lacking if this were just another game the plot would be highly acclaimed when being compared to most other games of the same genre but this is a metal gear solid game the story is incomplete and does not do what it set out to accomplish nearly the entire storyline of v is irrelevant to the rest of the series as a whole it explains almost nothing that it was created to explain in many ways it will leave a fan of the series feeling his own kind of phantom pain metal gear solid to me has always been half a game and half a movie this is 90 game with very few cinematic moments compared to its predecessors the explanations for many events and lack of logic in the plot has never been this poorly handled before in the series there are also blatantly stupid design choices one of the most beloved characteristics of the series has been mostly stripped away cutscenes the cutscenes that are present are very well done but much shorter and less frequent than what a fan of the series would be expecting many people complained about the amount and length of cutscenes in guns of the patriots but that doesnt mean that most of the story should be fed to the player through cassette tapes and radio communications phantom pain truly is the best title for this game because it feels like a large part of it was cut away you can still feel and miss what the game should have been with that said the gameplay is incredibly well done very fun and relatively balanced after a while missions may become repetitive and dull but there is almost always something else you can do to improve diamond dogs fob invasions while fun are very unbalanced and unfair to the attacker defending bases gives you a massively disproportionate advantage over the attacker with minimal risk to yourself fob invasions need to be revamped completely metal gear solid v the phantom pain is still very much worth the full price and is guaranteed to entertain you for many hours,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,you get a puppy with a matching eyepatch,1,1

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,gamplay mechanics the best most varied and most original in the series while the game rewards steath it can be played in an action style theres even some rpgesque elements to it really high amount of content to keep you busy for quite some time performance runs buttery smooth the game is very much able to run quite well on systems that are not brand new havent ran into a bug yet holds up to the typical kojimastandard of quality hideo is truly a master of his craft i know im not even halfway done with the game but you can feel kojimas mark in this game within the first few minutes of playing if you like stealth this is easily the best stealth game ive played gameplaywise will probably end up being that way with story as well if you like mgs seems to me to be the dream mgs game if the story holds up then it surely will be as the gameplay is definitely the best out of all the others already scores a 100100 in my book well miss you hideo old friend,1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,ive literally never played a metal gear game in my life and this is the best first impression possible ive fallen in love with mgsv from the storytelling the atmosphere graphics sound design level design and everything in between its everything ive ever wanted in a stealth game and some of the more absurd elements while they would detract from other games kojima manages to weave it perfectly into metal gear i have every intention to see the rest of the metal gear series after my time with this masterpiece 97510,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,mgsv is an open world actionadventure stealth game by the series creator hideo kojima it will most likely be the last metal gear game he will ever create and also maybe the last metal gear videogame ever you play as mercenary leader punished venom snake aka big boss the story is placed after the games mgs3 snake eater mgs peacewalker mgs ground zeroes and before the original game released on msx2 platform in 1987 metal gear i dont think its necessary to be familiar with other games in the series to enjoy phantom pain but ofcourse it helps to piece the whole story together gameplay first time ever mgs is based in a open world setting after the introductionprologue mission you are thrown in the mother base which is the heart of your operations to come you get to expand the base with different platforms by money and resources you get as a reward or gather yourself during missions you can also dispatch soldiers to go on missions on their own to gain even more money and resources these soldiers can be recruited during free roam or missions by fultoning unconscious enemy soldiers or saving prisoners of war so guns blazing with leathal weapons might not be the best option but its still an option dont forget to interrogate the soldiers either for locations of prisoners blueprints and etc you get to choose how you perform your missions and your perfomance is reviewed by a grade and a codename based on your style you have plenty of different tools in your disposal like stun grenades shotguns decoys rocket launchers water pistol and even the classic cardboard boxes that help you to sneak unnoticed but these items need to be researched and developed in your base first you start missions by calling in a helicopter to pick you up from base and then you can choose a mission from the list of main missions or side ops or just pick a drop off destination and go roam the world freely doing missions this is done by using idroid handsized device snake carries around its your primary tool for base management also and it works as a map besides the different weapons and tools you unlock you also get aided by few followers most notably ddog a puppy you can find and raise to be your aid and sniper called quiet both of them will mark enemies for you so you can see where they are going even through walls and you can give few simple commands to kill an enemy or make a distraction but beware even they might not notice every soldier the enemy ai is one of the best i have seen they react in realistic manner to your locations when spotted if you can change your cover without them noticing they dont magically know where to follow you but instead keep on firing and searching from the last known location in firefight enemies also act intelligently they dont just rush towards you but seek cover and call for back up presentation phantom pain is running on the fox engine created by hideo kojimas own studio it performs really good on pc and is quite remarkable in every way game looks really good and has great amount of detail in cutscenes snake is seen in the gear you have been wearing on missions even the possible spilled blood is there voice acting is very well done music composed for the game is great and you also can gather tapes of licensed 80s music from the enemy outposts you can listen to these tapes on your idroid unfortunaly most of the enviroments are just desert with guard outposts that dont seem much different i was left hoping for more different locations and especially more missions done mostly indoors and maybe bit more lively world than just few goats or jackals here and there story this might be the biggest shortcoming of mgsv earlier entries in the series are known for their long and frequent cutscenes there still are cutscenes ofcourse but the lenght and quantity has been greatly reduced though too much cutscenes is something that the series has been often criticized for but at the same time its been something many of the fans love much of the story is now told in tapes you gather by doing missions and you listen to them on your idroid when you wish codec calls as we used to know them are also gone you cant call different people for discussions anymore and theres no action halting calls coming to your way either but the problem is just not how the story is told it doesnt feel very impactful to the continuous story over all the games its still as wild and out there as it always has been and the tone is all over the place its up to the player how well heshe thinks the ridiculous comedy and over the top plot mixes with some quite dark themes i happen to like it what i loved was the story and character of quiet you get to develop a bond with her ingame as your character and even as a player if you choose to use her on missions i had my conclusion to quiets story after i had beaten the actual main story and it gave me more satisfying ending for the game overall metal gear solid v the phantom pain is a phenomenal game the gameplay itself is so damn fun with all the different possibilities you can approach the missions controls feel great and are intuitive with keyboardmouse or a controller the lackluster story cant pull the game down theres also an online portion to the game which i didnt try out at all so i wont comment on that the game has 2 chapters the second chapter was quite dissapointing in its mission structure you need to play older missions again with different rule sets to make them harder or grind sideops to unlock more main story missions i chose to do sidemissions going to same locations over and over again was bit frustrating but still the gameplay is just so fun and fluid it didnt bother me that much in the end while the game is played from 3rd person perspective shooting can be done through iron sights or scopes in first person its impossible to go through every cool thing in the game in this review theres just so much neat stuff to experience now go get the game let the legend come back to life score 93,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,this is one of the greatest games ever made hideo kojima is a hero,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,well it opens with 85 minutes of cutscenes the cutscenes are pretty epic after that you finally get to start exploring the open world of metal gear solid v and all i can say is that its pretty amazing you can go back and forth between the field and the mother base you can kidnap or hire members to your rampd team intel team and other teams just like previous mgs games and there are so many things you can make and upgrade were talking about a lot of different equipment explosives rifles pistols shotguns vehicle upgrades etc the gameplay mechanics are some of the best ive seen in a third person action game its so amazingly fluid and the graphics look amazing i am running it on high 1080p on my gtx 760 and it runs flawlessly constant 60fps without problems i really dont know any cons in this game,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,played this game too much alreadyim addicted and i love it update lets be a little more detailed what i love im a fan of the mgs series storyline will make your upset or cry at some point open world maps the real time weather and day cycles loads of stuff to develop replayable ability to have a dog as a buddy that fights the eh while the game seems incomplete it awnsered questions i had concerning the storyline there is a cut mission from the game which would of been awesome if they added it fob online base pvp has no anticheat beware there are some bugs in the game that could prove to be game breaking,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,pros its metal gear directed by hideo kojima appears everytime runs smooth as butter just as good as ground zeroes im on a laptop 4gb i5 gt 740m running the game on high fox engine is amazing keyboard and mouse controls are satisfying 2spooky8me heavy war themes historical references 80s music military acronyms deep discussions about society and culture young kids really shouldnt play this game they wont understand a lot some things may give them nightmares too still has that metal gear sense of humour which helps break up all the seriousness look out for the posters challenging and rewarding stealth that requires planning you cant always go in guns blazing impressive weapon gameplay that really affects the outcome of how you play bullet drop realistic reload with chambered ammo custom attachments etc true freedom free to roam and play how you want although the prologue and beginning is linear gorgeous environments theres several different environments not just sand a lot of welcome surprises gameplay and story wise i didnt watch any spoilers pc dev team has very fast response time and has released patches to improve the game they really care about the game they fixed a major bug with phenon ii cpus in under 5 hours emotional and thought provoking at times things like a prisoner crying because you came to save them their speech weak because theyve been tortured and beaten it becomes harder to pull the trigger when you eaves drop on enemies and hear that they only took the job to support their children sneaking out of a base saving the prisoner and not killing anyone makes you feel like a true hero when you return to your base everyone salutes you and thanks you for saving them no other game can offer that feeling cons people who didnt play ground zeroes may find the controls learning curve a bit steep menu doesnt have mouse support navigate with wasd i dont mind but im guessing that will make some people mad windows 10 users may have issues some people have the game running fine while others not at all most people having trouble running the game are using windows 10 if you are using windows 10 maybe wait a bit longer the devs havent tested it out so officially its not supported so ive finished the game and i can say without a doubt that this game is worth playing people will still be playing this 5 years from now because it is so much fun i know i will,1,1
287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,despite the hate mgsv received i would still recommend it the hate is perfectly understandable but this game is one of the best stealth games i ever played personally i advocate for gameplay first when it comes to video games and this one has solid gameplay stealth,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and second part of the witcher you simply wont find anything that hasnt changed for the better vast open world that is not randomly created and filled with dull stuff story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end graphics even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade still makes this game the best looking rpg ever created soundtrack it finally goes back to the style presented originally in the witcher 1 something what makes you forget thats just the video game it gives you the feeling you are in there in some village city or that you are fighting with someone something which makes from every single battle an unforgettable memory every single side quest and believe me there is a lot of them is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests i call it a new quality in rpgs choices and their impact on the story even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you this game is mature finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all combat nothing more to add its decent though its nothing to be praised really you wont be able to mash buttons and win you have to dodge use signs and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his misery the witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws although nothing that cant be fixed some balance issues economy basically showing geralt as a very wealthy person who he should not be small performance problems like stuttering in novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content fixed by the expansions many of the things i struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them all in all one of the best games in the last few years even a decade,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this is the greatest game ive ever played in my life ive been gaming since pong2600 my time played is bordering on embarassing and its going to get worse with baw just released this is my comfort game whenever i am bored of another game i can always come back to this one i also played through w1 and w2 multiple times not on steam so i was foaming at the mouth for years waiting for this game im the kind of gamer where i need the big 3 from a game story lootcrafting char devepmentcustomizationskilltrees this game has it all and its completely adjustable only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into craftingalchemyskills just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that and just watch the story naughty dogtelltale style you want to get hardcore and make all the craftingoilsbombspotionsthought into char build usefull turn it on death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on dm and it is the true witcher 3 experience games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore a good example of this recently was uncharted 4 dont get me wrong it had a great story but after the witcher i was bored to tears and still havent finished it in that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story which is fine for some people but not me in witcher 3 you get a got quality of a story including voice acting animation ect however when you want to take a break from that visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized withcher gear 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures hunt down rare ingredients for your potionsbombsoils theres all of that and i havent even talked about gwent yet you will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game the game is so ing good that they are now releasing it as a full game because everyone went ape nuts for it ive played so much gwent that i know what the computer is going to do before they even do it i could go on and on but bottom linethis game has set a new mark in all the gaming industry for other compaines to aspire to cdpr for ing life pros everything it has it all this is the equivelent of gaming super crack great char building and skill trees even better now with baw dlc a very well done and responsive battle system that gets even more fun and tacticle as you turn up the difficulty the only sword fight simulator that is better is dark souls tons of weapons armor and crafting including all the witcher specialized sets that change their look with each upgrade one of the greatest game stories ive ever seen which may have only been topped by its own dlc in hearts of stone top notch voice acting animation and choicedialog system ing gwent a vast living breathing open world only rivaled by gtavs open world for scope and detail details details details a huge amount of love and time were poured into this game i spend hours just looking at stuff and admiring all the little things see hours played cons it will ruin all other games for you everything else is now harder to get in to because of this so you knowbe careful,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,for me this is the best single player game ive ever played storyline 1010 story is presented in a very nice form in most of the dialogue you can choose what to say we have many ways to pass the mission we can do it quietly or killing everyone each mission is interesting and different than earlier the story is for 30h game without sidequests we also have mini games like cards gwent gameplay 910 beautiful world giving many opportunities for the player we can explore caves forests mountains helping peoples and doing much more things the map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part crafting and alchemy are more important we also can upgrade swords armors and signs these sandbox gives many many opportunities fight feeling is pleasant sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying characters 1010 each character has its own charm characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment we can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend we also can choose the path of the main character character mainly geralts and monsters doing really great feeling details are amazing graphics 1010 graphics in this game is amazing even the smallest details are well refined for example when we move the grass moves with us graphics capabilities used in 100 the movement of water clouds are very well refined falling leaves changing weather make a huge impression sounds 1010 music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits we can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game animals noises are natural the monsters sounds are really threatening character voices are well selected and fit into personalities overall 1010 if you are thinking about purchase this game if you like open world and action rpg games i would recommend these game for you and i guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game these game is masterpiece,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the amount of content you get for your money is unbelievable every sidequest is interesting something i have never seen in my entire gamerlife 1010,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,ive been planning to make huge review for this game but in the end decided to keep it short masterpiece,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i hope one day i get amnesia so i can play again to full effect,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,ive been a gamer most of my life starting with my first atari 2600 in the early 1980s this is the greatest rpg ive ever played ive used steam for many years now and never written a review for a game beforethis game was good enough to make me feel like i should looking back on it i feel like i actually played several games the overall storyline contained so many subplots that each chapter felt like its own complete game ive heard some people mention this as a negative but i cant possibly see how its valueyou dont have to play the game if you dont want to if you only want 40 hours of content from a aaa title then quit playing it after 40 hours as for the quests themselves i found even the random miniquests generated from undiscovered locations to be wellexecuted and thoughtful some of which would only take a few minutes to complete but added genuine character to the gaming world making it feel like a real place after over 170 hours of play i found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around skellige checking out undiscovered locations even though i knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches and i already had all the gear and crowns i could ever usei didnt want it to end i anxiously await the next dlc expansion i hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well and for the life of me i cant understand why in close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky and its hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed but thats only in a few specific places the combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it you can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blockingcountering if your opponent is human dodgeattack if your opponent is a monster now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs potions decoctions and signs especially in conjunction with area effects and each otherthere are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with igni is always entertaining as is using axii to make a guy kill his buddy some special attacks you can unlock like whirl are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship gwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention and i really didnt know what to make of it at first after analyzing it for a little while and picking up some different cards with different abilities i began to realize the genius of it and eventually got to the point where i can honestly say i havent had as much fun with an rpg minigame since triple triad in ff8 its just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep well there you go my first steam review i enjoyed this game immensely and unless youre a cave troll you probably will too,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,over 1000 hours and i still dont know how to play gwent,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,195 hours later my epic journey with geralt of rivia comes to a close anything i say now would just be retreading over what everyone else has said but regardless this was one of the finest gaming experiences of my life the world was meticulously crafted the story was engaging the characters were believable the struggles and victories powerful combat was enjoyable and varied this was magnificent not a perfect game but very close to it performance left a lot to be desired and the bug list was shocking to be perfectly honest exceeded if not matched only by the likes of obsidian and bethesda and that simply should not happen in this day and age the ui was merely passable in some instances and downright terrible in others and sadly the levelledloot was made utterly worthless due to the expansive crafting system in the game you craft and use for the majority of the game far better gear than you can find or buy and that too is a shame still i wont soon forget this game and indeed i fear now that the bar has been raised to such a level that it will negatively impact my enjoyment of other socalled open world rpgs to come a bitter sweet realisation i guess though theres nothing to do about it now except wait and hope for games to match the quality set forth by the witcher 3 onward to cyberpunk cdpr youve got your work cut out for you thats for damned sure 1010 would snowball fight with ciri again,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,pros fabulous graphics very big open world to explore amazing storytelling very good voice acting likeable characters detailed and immersive cutscenes a lot of choices to make enjoyable combat many high quality optional side quests dlcs actually contain a lot of extra content gwent cons the game ends,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,witcher 3 is not a game its another life you can live in there are sights to be viewed jobs to be done friends to hang out with and family to love and protect so witcher 3 is not a game gwent is,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this video game is a true masterpiece the witcher 3 offers the best storyline ive ever seen you can decide anything both minor and major things all characters in game have their own story which is really awesome velen is a land that suffered war and gives you that real authentic touch of how medieval land looks like just like novigrad which is just how one middleage city looked like graphics are beautiful and honestly i havent seen a rpg like it after that you have epic side quests with amazing lore and seriously huge map to explore by huge i mean the biggest map for 1 higly complexed video game in history then when i entered the skellige its like i entered another worldthe authentic irish accent made it look like whole another universe which this game truly is during game you have several romance options and you choose a girl which you will end up with which is something seirously amazing for a video game not to mention all those sex scenes to complete main storyline alone it takes around 50 hours while ending depends on you and your choices troughout whole game the soundtracks in this game are literally the best they are mostly made of polish folk music but there are also some serbian such as oj lazare which are some of the best slavic musics the only con in this game was that in free roam i didnt have the option to talk to the main characters but that was fixed in latest expansion which i really appreciate cdpr for as i and many other customers requested it i wont be describing dlcs as this review should be dedicated to the base game i really recommend this game to everyone from rpg fans to those who never played a rpg game before you will enjoy this game and you must play it it was worth every cent 1010,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this game is more than another blockbuster title its one of those that defined a chapter in my life i played witcher 1 when it was released in 2007 back when i was a single man working in my first job few years out of college i even remember playing it through one of the worst years of my life 2011 came witcher 2 was released and i immediately bought the box set with the soundtrack coin and map a lot of things changed in my life by then and i took on a whole new adventure in career travel and even love then after many years witcher 3 after finishing blood and wine the final expansion i uninstalled and finally closed this magnificent story that has been a part of me for the last nine years now as my wife and i take on a new adventure into parenthood i know that i wont have time to finish long rpgs anymore so this may be my last hurrah that being said this game its story characters lore will remain with me moving forward defining what story and videogames can and should be goodbye and see you witcher salute,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,set a standard that every game and developer hasnt been met yet makes it kinda sad the more you think about it like this game has essentially ruined gaming,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,im scared ill never have this much fun again edit just finished both dlc now im sure i wont have fun again,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,witcher 3 is not a game its another life you can live in there are sights to be viewed jobs to be done friends to hang out with and family to love and protect worth all 1010,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,almost killed a fetus threw a baby in the oven had sex on a unicorn hired strippers for only 20 orens cried like a baby when i did the last main quest and realized i wont ever play a game such as this one infinite10,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,his beard grows in real time beard grows oh and theres a vast beautiful open world to explore stuffed with interesting sidequests and amazing graphics but who cares about that,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this review has now been moved to my original account please view the review here updated review its hard to try and summarise a game that has so much depth because it truly deserves more then just a review for recognition the witcher 3 wild hunt has got to be one of the greatest single player games ive ever played and that is from somebody that is not accustomed to the previous two titles with so many areas to talk about ill first mention about game dialogue considering an average novel is between 80000 and 100000 words the script to witcher 3 accumulates to a 450000 word goliath unbelievable it requires over 950 speaking roles which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish whats slightly more incredible then those statistics is that witcher 3 makes you feel like you dont want to skip any of it whatsoever through an amalgamation of whit thrill mystery passion and more ive never known a game to deliver dialogue so well but on top of that its you that gets the choice of how the story goes your in control you can continue to show geralt as the renowned warrior he is or you can often show his softer side in certain situations there is no right or wrong even towards the latter stages codeveloper marcin iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings for the game mind blown the environment to witcher 3 is also a great achievement in itself to put it into perspective the map is 20 larger than skyrim its also 35 times larger than the map found in witcher 2 a large map is a good feat on its own but these facts give cd projekt red massive bragging rights at first it felt like the environment was very much going to be the same throughout and i was really wondering whether or not there would be massive differences later on as it turns out there is so much more in the lands of witcher 3 to explore in which i was extremely keen to find for myself you get to see a lot of the world through the storyline but stepping away from that and doing side quests amp contracts are where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances i cant honestly tell you another game thats genuinely made me want to do everything each side quest feels like a ministoryline you dont seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature on one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that velen and skellige have to offer then on the other side youll be hunting treasure balls deep in nekker swamps youll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests treasure hunts and contracts it can sometimes lead to confusion but the easiest way to clear your journal is to go through them one by one obviously due to level restrictions some of them cannot be completed until geralt is stronger which doesnt mean you cant try to do them it just means that it will be incredibly difficult to do so one moment that i will always remember is when i went to fight a royal griffin that was 12 levels higher then me i would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain but its almost like the griffin was laughing at me all i seemed to do was shave feathers off its back nothing more then in one foul swoop id be dead repeat dead repeat dead im one that embraces difficulty playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic yet this was a battle that i had to swallow my pride and leave go away get stronger come back and rip that ing bird to pieces this was great not many times have i been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level with this said i actually much preferred witcher 3s approach it created some great and memorable fight scenes where i wouldnt necessarily assume victory certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on so returning to them 50 hours later provides a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power now i remember all those years ago playing cards in a big saloon in red dead redemption poker blackjack maybe a little bit of five finger fillet or liars dice these were wonderful times now i have a new love playing gwent gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth something beloved by both roadweary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties i have no idea how much time ive spent playing gwent in this game all i can say is that 25 hours into this game i was level 3 3 gwent immediately took my focus as i attempted to gain recognition throughout velen its a continous side quest in the game challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments not only that but also every merchant is up for a game just when you think your building a great deck and come out of a tournament as the winner a local fishmonger will always be ready to embarass you early on anyway it becomes a breeze later on in game there is also a quest to collect them all so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of nilfgaard northen realms monsters amp scoiatael ive always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting particularly when the mechanisms are right i have heard mixed reviews about the mechanisms to witcher 3 combat some arguing that geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack absolute garbage i think combat can be pretty tricky in witcher 3 for those unfamiliar with the series considering the many different mechanics in play at any one time blocking parrying signs pivots rolls variant of sword etc practice makes perfect and it is different to other games so get used to it thats all i can say dismemberment is always a joy to behold and geralt doesnt hold back on his capability to carve through people creatures and monsters like butter could this game have anything to make it better yes amp it does free dlc not just a few but 16 16 free dlc packages to add even more into a wellpacked game cd projekt red have had the best launch ive seen of a game in terms of its update structure and responsiveness to peoples comments from launch there was new dlc every week patches to address issues and bugs retaining ingame free dlc includes new armor sets the ability to visit a barber new quests contracts animations alternative looks and not to forget the new game mode i put this review on hold numerous of times as it deserved to be reviewed once completed it truly is a remarkable and well made game that will forever have the highest of impacts on me its groundbreaking in every sense of the word and literally pisses all over certain companies that think its right to strip a new game of content then release it as paid dlc congratulations to cd projekt red for providing one of the most immersive amp detailed games that i have ever seen i look forward to the expansions hearts of stone amp blood and wine to continue my witcher journey,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,honestly this game is brilliant im 30 hours in and feel like i have not even started yet the maps are huge and quite intimidating there are lots of things to see and places to explore sometimes randomly exploring places you will find a hidden letter or item that leads you on a new quest speaking of quests the secondary ones tie in beautifully with the main story and feel like they have meaning and purpose behind them the visuals are stunning especially if you have a rig capable of using hairworks and hbao to their full potential the daynight cycle on top of the changing weather conditions really engross you in the world the sound both ambient and effects are all awe inspiring just listening to the wind blow the trees the village sounds of hammer on steel and axe on wood even the gentle noises your horse makes as you travel is just very immersing the story telling is one of the major positives for me personally all the npcs really come alive with the texture and detail on their faces cd projekt red did a great job with that the voice acting is great much better than witcher 2 and feels far more professional all of the conversation options are well thought out and there are plenty of decisions with some severe consequences depending on the way you play it if you import a witcher 2 save you will have a few surprises and reappearances as well combat is solid it takes a little practice to get to grips with the dodging parrying and when to use the signs effectively but once you work it out you will love fighting some mobs the skill tress are varied and indepth and you can really tailor your play style by equippingunequipping specific skills for different scenarios using mutagens to further develop and buff your abilities there is so much more i could talk about like gwent the card game barteringintimidation mechanics boat sailing all the crafting and potions but you need to play it yourself to really appreciate it hopefully with further updates and user mods the game will continue to improve and evolve there are not many negatives mostly performance related which as of writing a lot of have been fixed already with v103,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this game is a masterpiece it is possible that it is the greatest rpg game ever side quests are not boring the game world is huge weapons are great and combat although has some minor problems is glorious no game is perfect this game has some problems but the combination of great atmosphere depth story attention to details quest diversity sound voice acting music monsters weapons armors storms roach the horse and of course the best mini game i have ever encounter in a video game gwent all of this plus dozens of other great things add up and to give 1010 masterpiece keep reading for a few more details if you are interested side quests i will not specifically mention any side quest because i dont want to spoil anything but i have to praise the quality of the side quests i have played a lot of rpgs in my life and i have never encountered one whose secondary quests are so well written even the smallest one of them have something interesting for example a dead guy can have a note on his body which narrates something related to his final demise also im not exaggerating when i said that the stories of this quests are amazing going even head to head with main stories of other games some of these quests endure 2 or 3 or more hours also the main quests are amazing monsters yes there are monsters in this game and you will hunt them down and probably kill them occasionally you may let them live if you choose so but the best part is that you can track this monsters down with something similar to detective mode which will give you hints of what kind of monster you are tracking also villagers may help to determine of what kind it is and there is strategy in this monsters have weakness to something it varies from monster to monster to learn about this weaknesses you can read the bestiary which is a log of entries that have descriptions histories and details of monsters there are necrophages specters giants insectoids draconoids and many others you mostly track them down by accepting or taking witcher contracts potions crafting alchemy yes this game has all of this i as a player usually dont waste time with alchemy but i really enjoy it in this game there are dozens of potion recipes and diagrams for armor and swords that you will encounter in the game world and they are meaningful not like in skyrim were you have like a million useless potion in your pockets in here i actually use them especially while fighting monsters for example there a different kind of oils that can be applied to your swords each one add damage bonus to a specific kind of enemy graphics sounds and music yes i was a little bit disappointed when i saw all of the graphic downgrade posts and news and yes there is some downgrade if you compare the game with the e3 trailers now that said even with the downgrade the graphics have remained impressive armors lighting reflections all of them looks well the game atmosphere is amazing there are storms strong winds rain thunders and even the occasional fog is some areas so dont let the graphic downgrade thing affect your judgement of this game its pretty the sound is top quality too and the music is also top quality combat the combat control is not perfect specially the first few hours but as you become more familiar with controls you will really enjoy and master its mechanics geralt of rivia and remember you are a witcher a guy who is basically an expert swordsman and alchemist but at the same time have some basic knowledge of magic spells like kinetic blasts and fire bursts this is not an rpg were you create a character in here you play with a forced role you play as geralt of rivia and you have no choice in that matter but this is not a bad thing you will feel like geralt and live as himand decides like him geralt will have to deal with hundreds of choices in his adventure those choices have different outcomes if you had never played any witcher games lets said that this is something similar to mass effect choices but better also you can import your save files from witcher 2 so decision in there has some interesting outcomes in witcher 3 if you have never played any witcher game dont worry you will still understand the game progress yes there is ability tree and all that stuff so you as you gain xp you can invest points in different abilities like magic combat and alchemy and a general attribute section gwent this is an in game card mini game im one of those guys who usually ignores all mini games in games but you should try gwent it has a lot of depth and strategy at the beginning it may be difficult but as you progress you will earn new cards that will help you in your gwent careertry the mini game is amazing update 1110,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the con of this game is you dont know what to do after you finish it its a masterpiece,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,537 hours and still continue playing thats your answer for how good it is,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the witcher 3 is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish its also the best candle lighting simulator,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,when im 80 years old and sitting in my rocking chair ill be playing the witcher 3 and my family will say to me after all this time and i will say always this game deserves every last bit of praise it has gotten it has one or two flaws most of which will be resolved with the addons but youll have to be really really picky to find them if youll even notice only problem with this game is that it still finishes me even upon finishing the game for the third time and that i have absolute no idea what to play next for whatever it will be i will be sorely disappointed,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,just going to recommend because this really should say overwhelmingly positive instead of very positive,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the witcher 3 makes fallout 4 look like a childrens game,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,genre open worlded fantasy rpg i have played through the witcher 1 and 2 until the end of both recently i read all the english translated books by andrzej sapkowski a hero and they are highly recommended i have already ploughed 80 hours into this game by doing many exploration sub and main quests i am trying to have breaks so i will finish it eventually unlike skyrim where i was skyrimd out the monsters characters and environments stay true to the witcher world you can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment they are providing free dlc but you can buy a season pass if you want even more witcher goodness the fighting is fluid and there are horse races crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game shame there are no sex cards this time though the graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary you actually feel like you are making a difference to the world around you liberating towns and developing relationships this is one of the best games i have played i wont say game of the year just yet but it is clearly going to be in the top five,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i admit i was a bit concerned over the few years that the witcher 3 was being developed hearing how cd projekt red decided to go openworld and make the game 30 times larger than the previous witcher games these games were always more about substance for me and openworld games tend to lose some of that i wasnt so sure it would work then the game then was delayed in 2014 wasnt a good sign for me soon after it was released i picked it up i spent the first few hours just taking in how beautiful and detailed the game world was the water trees animals grasseverything felt alive i started playing the game and got hooked the main questline itself was full of characters you grow to love and care about and a story that you typically dont get in a video game the side quests in the game werent your typical fetch this or kill this typeall of them had a story and decisions to make on how to complete them the combat seemed clunky at first but then you start to realize this isnt a button mashing game patience and timing was the way to go it can be on the easy side on the normal difficulty levels especially when only using your sword for combat but it gets more interesting when you start to use alchemy and signs in the end i couldnt believe how great of a game this ended up being the games production values and writing are some of the best ive ever seen although i spent 150 hours in my first playthrough of this game i was bummed it was ending rarely do i feel like that after playing a game of this scale it really is amazing how much cd projekt red put into this and they easily made one of the best games ive ever played,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i couldnt believe how empty i felt after finishing this game i got that feeling you get after you finish a reaaallly good netflix series you just dont know what to do in your life anymore but seriously i loved everyone minute of this game and really tried to stretch it into the most hours the main story is awesome i loved messing around with ciri and my witcher buddies i felt like every decision was important and the game does a really good job of that the consequences for decisions may be immediate or will present themselves over time whether they be good or bad i love this game and eagerly await the lengthy expansions buy the witcher 3 now,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,pros geralt can now jump swim ride a horse and sail boat geralt now have learn how to grow beard con final series of the current witcher trilogy sidenote number 3 is not a curse sign as valve believe cd projekt red has proved it by making this game truly a masterpiece cant wait for the next installment,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,the witcher 3 wild hunt continues the noveltovideogame adaptation of polish author andrzej sapkowskis witcher saga this latest entry in the series concludes the tale of witcher geralt of rivia by following his quest to track down his adopted daughter ciri she is being chased by the mysterious and evil wild hunt while previous witcher games featured a more linear level structure the witcher 3 is the first to introduce a completely open world that is described by the developers as 20 percent larger than the elder scrolls v skyrim geralt is a witcher a spellsword trained and mutated from childhood to become a nearsuperhuman monster slayer the games prologue finds him in search of the two most important people in his life his lover yennefer and his adopted daughter ciri for different reasons both are being pursued by a terrifying supernatural force known as the wild hunt like a lot of things in life this game is much more about the journey than the destination geralts journey sees him make his way through three huge distinct and open areas of the northern kingdoms and their surrounds roman empire analogue nilfgaard is on the brink of completing a crushing invasion of them but begins the game in a temporary stalemate against the last two of these kingdoms united under the banner of the stern king radovid v the witcher 3 wild hunt expects and rewards preparation above all else anybody who plays it like an assassins creed title or other action game will find themselves reloading frequently i should know because thats how i initially approached it mashing attack might kill a few stray dogs but thats about it as i found out side quests are all but mandatory as enemies do not scale to the players level its one among many ways that the witcher 3 wild hunt makes you feel like one man in a very large world thats one of the things i really appreciated about the game the tutorial if enabled will nudge you once or twice but afterwards will leave you with plenty of rope with which you are free to hang yourself with multiple save files are a must for this reason the games soundtrack was generally fairly restrained but battle seemed to bring out the silly side of it each time the chorus of wailing warrior women got started i felt like geralt and i had stepped into an episode of xena warrior princess in a way thats an apt comparison as geralt slashes pirouettes and leaps through skirmishes i cant help but think of xena beloved in part for its occasionally slapstick choreography combat is both challenging and rewarding experimentation is again encouraged i found that one of geralts signs minor spells that witchers cast was able to knock men from horses from there geralt was able to execute the grounded fighters without a struggle i realised that a similar technique could be applied to flying enemies and cursed myself for having not thought of it earlier it wasnt too long ago that i had been fighting a griffin after all signs swordplay bombs potions and oils are geralts main tools in combat and the witcher 3 wild hunts crafting ensures that youll be making the majority of them yourselves weapons and armor both degrade over time and require repair in order to function properly for a small fee craftsmen can also take materials provided and upgrade geralts current gear or craft entirely new items for him youll find yourself spending a lot of time in the company of blacksmiths so why not challenge a few to some cards thats where gwent the witcher 3 wild hunts amazing minigame comes in gwent has its roots in games like goofspiel being a simple game to learn but a complex one to master supposedly an analogue for how a battle unfolds gwent sees players placing numbered cards across three different zones the first player to have the highest numbers on their side of the board for two rounds wins its not as crucial a part of the game as triple triad was for final fantasy viii but it was compelling enough that i had to force myself away from it lest this turn into gwent a review load times are disguised by short recaps of relevant main quests matched to panning images like the one above unless youre reloading a save or just opening the game you wont actually see them often at all the witcher 3 wild hunt really is an open world gone are the days of plotting where to base your skyrim life to minimize loading transitions if you see something in the witcher 3 wild hunt you can usually walk up to or inside of it on the presentation and visual side the witcher 3 delivers one of the more engrossing and atmospheric game worlds seen in awhile from trees waving in the wind to waistdeep swamps everything about the games visuals create a world that effortlessly combines realworld beauty with fantasy and medieval themes the game world is presented in such a way that each territory and the people that reside in its cities are unique in their views on the current war not to mention differences in their clothing and armor larger cities feature shady characters walking about streets and s on corners promoting brothels while a smaller more controlled city only contains nobles and streets that are well maintained while there is a fast travel system its far more enjoyable and atmospheric to use geralts horse roach or to sail across rivers and oceans in a boat theres a whole bunch of blacksmithing and alchemy plans to uncover and put to use as well the world is chockful of components particularly on the alchemy side where the general wilderness seems to hold plants to collect every few 10 yards or so it can get a bit overwhelming early on but youll quickly learn that its not necessary to use or craft every potion or oil in the game as you slowly mold your alchemy use to something that benefits your particularly playstyle crafting armor and weapons is fairly easy to do but i found plans and competent crafters were a bit hard to come by the side contracts are where the game really shines where other open world fantasy games would treat bulletin board quests as a chance to make players gather ten bear butts through text only prompts these can be just as nuanced as the main story chapters with interesting twists on straightforward setups forcing the player to make the call as to who the real monster is even incidental missions and collectables filling up the map while appearing too much like ubisoft at first blush manage to have something of a narrative seed embedded within treasure hunts often have examples of environmental storytelling and letters and roadside encounters can lead to more complicated missions later on storywise the witcher 3 does an admirable job of giving new players enough information for them to

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,please do believe me when i say this ive never wanted to write a review for the witcher 3 wild hunt because no matter how much you praise this game in your wall of text you just cant do justice to this masterpiece words cant possibly express nor describe this experience this journey to be honest i dont know what else to say despite all that i felt the urge to write at least something even if it is just a few words after all this is my favourite game of all time a mustbuy and dont get me started on the dlc,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,never heard of the witcher bought it prerelease cause of the hype played it loved it cry in bed because i finished it played it again addicted in therapy at the moment they say i will never be happy again go buy it now,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,ive been gaming for well over 30 years ive been pc gaming since before windows even existed ive long been an avid fan of storydriven rpgs and there are not many out there ive not played that being said you can take my review with however large a grain of salt you may wish to say the game is vast belies the true scope the designers wisely guide you from quest to quest in a flowing natural way almost always part of the story note that i said guide there is rarely any pressure or situations that lockstep you into a given path you are free to make choices that let you go as deep down the rabbithole as you wish to go and that hole is very deep indeed story rich is a term that has a nice general sort of meaning to it but again does not do the efforts of cdpr proper justice the game is so tightly wound into the books that unless you have read them you constantly miss the references that are so beautifully woven into the tale if you have not read the books you dont lose anything but you definitely gain so much more for the knowledge the story while deep and inviting is marred a bit by the development of some of the characters there are some that have a constant impact in the game but the characters themselves feel somewhat shallow and undeveloped yennefer for example the character of the books is haughty proud complex and passionate the game character feels just bty and moody some of them however are just delightful and give you real reason to buy in to them zoltan and dandelion come immediately to mind the environment i am somewhat of two minds about the environment aspects of it are epicthe vistas from on high can be breathtaking the play of light through trees and the colors at sunrise and sunset are a visual feast there is a great deal to lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that is critical for immersion into the game world but there are some things that blow that disbelief up quicker than a grapeshot bomb the trees bushes and grasses look very obviously twodimensional it was a disappointment that was lessoned somwhat by the variety in the landscapes and the impact of weather on it but it still was a bit of a jarring surprise when taken in context with the overall quality of the environment then there are the many inconsistencies in the way geralt interacts with his environment swimming on land the inability to use terrain to your advantage in combat getting stuck in trees etc combat is by far the best iteration of all the games in the trilogy it still remains a bit clunky having to go into inventory then go to your potionsfoodbombs tab then select the bombs you want to use then exit out of all that to have to go into the wheel and select the bomb before you throw itis a real pain in the would have made far more sense to allow the user to simply click on the bomb slot in the power wheel and get a pop up inventory of just bombs same for potions slots and special slots but beyond those inconveniences the blend of signs and attacks coupled with dodging parries and combat rolls makes for an engaging flowing combat experience some fights are simply acrobatic melees while others require careful patience waiting for the right time to strike while maintaining a stout defense to avoid getting oneshotted now all this having been said i have to admit that i was more than a bit disappointed that cdpr fell into the same trap of american publishers putting the game out before all the bugs were ironed out there have already been 8 patches and still there remains a plethora of irritating bugs inability to talk to certain npcs that you should be able to talk to without meditating for an hour first or the flank speed on boats not working are the two most immediate that leap to mind yes there are pros yes there are cons but even with the cons i would easily match this to the mass effect trilogy or the dragon age trilogy as one of the most enjoyable rpg experiences ive ever had in gaming ive already played the game 3 times back to back and working on a 4th with the new game which really is the exact same game with everything made higher levelive not yet seen a benefit to this yet watching geralts beard grow as time goes by was just a huge giggle for me it was a neat touch watching whales in the ocean broach by my boat as i sailed by gave me no end of delight i parked geralt on a mountain top in skellige and watched an entire sunset i checked myself into gwent addicts anonymous would i recommend this game without a breath of hesitation then i would immediately advise to take the bugs with a grain of salt and get lost in this rather amazing world and thoroughly enjoyable story go and see just how deep that rabbit hole is,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,its strange how the main game gwent is hidden in some kind of wierd storydriven rpg the rpg is okay too i guess,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i dont know if i can adequately explain why this game is as amazing as i think it is but ill try the good the writing hands down this game has some of the best writing ive ever experience in an rpg the main quest feels very personal and you actually want to progress in order to find out what happens next the characters are all interesting and also incredibly wellwritten the quests again this game has the best side quests out of all the rpgs ive played and thats saying a lot every quest seems to have at least some back story theres typically at least a few forms of interaction other than just killing something and then returning to the quest giver the decisions you make are never black and white and usually involve some form of consequences and finally you actually get to feel like a real witchermonster hunter by taking on some really fun witcher contracts the world velen and skellige can both rival some of the largest open worlds out there in terms of size and yet the level of detail and polish remains consistent throughout exploration is very rewarding theres loot to be found everywhere and little quests can be unlocked along the way to help you find even more treasure novigrad is a huge city and you just walk inside without a hint of a loading screen it actually feels like a living breathing world npcs have daytimenighttime routines and will seek shelter if it starts to rain little things like that go along way to bring you into a world graphics and art design how can i put this all things considered the witcher 3 is probably the most beautiful game ive ever played you must experience this game in motion but feel free to look through my screenshots if you need convincing wwwflickrcom one thing that cant be seen in screenshots is the way everything moves and feels alive and while the wind effect might seem overdone it really helps to sell the atmosphere the witcher 3 can be rough around the edges and other games are definitely doing some more impressive things technically but the overall witcher 3 experience is definitely greater than the sum of its parts the combat this grew on me at first i didnt like it i didnt think signs were strong enough and i was constantly getting my butt kicked but then i learned how to dodge and counter properly i learned how to use signs to my advantage i learned how to stick and move and start treating each encounter like a puzzle eventually i was punching way above my weight taking on level 20 witcher contracts with a level 14 character now i love the combat and im always looking forward to doing the next witcher contract the bad controls quite possibly my biggest gripe with the game controls just feel clunky at best i play with a mouse and keyboard so maybe that is part of the reason but movement in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive sometimes ill try to move geralt a little bit and he wont budge and at other times hell move too far and run off a cliff just turning around can feel like a chore as geralt has a rather large turning radius even worse are the horse controls which kinda feels like driving around a very large suv constantly getting stuck on geometry and trying to maneuver around it is an ongoing frustrating chore balance even on the largest difficulty it doesnt take long for this game to become a cake walk if you enjoy the sidequests like i do youll likely spend a lot of time completing them instead of doing the main quest the main quest is good but some of the games best content can be found in the sidequests and after 20 hours of questing youll probably find that the next step in the campaign is 5 levels below you and therefore not challenging in the slightest there were several instances where id go up against an enemy that is supposed to be tough and intimidating but i kill it in less than 12 seconds loot progression is also a joke if you do any kind of crafting the witcher gear is probably better than anything the game will give you from monsters or chests during your travels youll come across countless relic quality swords and they may even have more damage than your current green sword but witcher gear is highly specialized and usually compliment specific builds using a higher damage sword might actually gimp you if you lose a massive bonus to sign intensity or adrenaline point gain other stuff theres still so much i could go into replay value is probably lower since you only have 1 character to play as but the game makes up for that with a much more personal and involved story gwent is probably a very fun card game but i still havent played a single game due to not wanting to dump a ton of time into it some day i will witcher sense is fun at first but after a while it will feel like a chore having to hold down the button combined with the ridiculous screen effects really hampers my enjoyment of this commonly used mechanic and you never feel like youre solving an investigation using witcher sense just looking for red stuff on the ground and following on screen prompts while geralt figures everything out for you conclusion i can not possibly cover everything there is to cover about this massive game but i can say that the good far outweighs the bad and that this is is my favorite open world rpg of all time i know that the witcher series isnt for everyone but i think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try and again if you need convincing that this game is dropdead gorgeous have a look through my screenshots httpswwwflickrcomphotosjim2point0sets72157653074223832,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this game is so spot on in so many areas that its hard to review imagine a really really good movie with action and suspense and wry comedy and adult themes now imagine that it has its own world its own lore and youre actually playing a character in it becoming doubly invested in the characters stories i know that this is the promise of so many other games but the witcher 3 actually delivers like no other game the difficulty is super scalable so that you get just as much tension as you want making it excellent even for casuals i have spent nearly 200 hours on just one playthrough without a break in which i played something else ive been gaming since the days of the tandy 1000 and i have never put this kind of time into a game and im looking forward to delving into the dlc if there was a game that deserved in content quality enjoyability and sheer production quality to be far higher than the 5999 aaa mark this would be it and its 3999 right now you need to play this game now while everything is still the best that exists dont let this one be one of those that you put off for ten years only to meh at it when its cheap if you buy one aaa game in 2016 and 2017 combined it should be this one,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,finally the epic finale for the story of geralt of rivia arrived combining the best of open world rpg and story driven rpg cdproject tried to offer the best of both worlds so to speak while many say it is the next skyrim i always had to think more of red dead redemption in fantasy both games had a fixed main character which is only so far customizeable which is a big difference from skyrims system also the dark and gritty settings with their bit of melodramatic storyline exploring all the mostly bad sides of humanity are quite similiar naturally the witcher has the plus of a more interesting background world filled with magic war and monsters as well as being the finale to a story spanning three games and many books also cdpr did the trick to create an open world which not only looks beautiful and offers an nearly unbelievable amount of possibilities to do but also kept the content of the great amount of quests so unique that none feels the same and surely not like the boring mmo grinding stuff for example some bioware products of late do the characters are also very well made and i surely couldnt believe the stupidity of some gaming journalists whining about how witcher 3 favors anti female and racist content anyways naturally even this new rpg masterwork isnt without its flaws sadly some bugs still can annoy players one which even seems to be introduced with the last patch disturbing some character models though i trust cd project to solve this in due time one of the other controversies about this game seem to concern the problems for a game which is made both for consoles as well as pc to be optimised for both while on the one hand some graphic options had to be tuned down due to the limited possibilities of the consoles the menus and texts which were quite fine on pc were often complained about by console players this section confesses nearly all of the bad points for witcher 3 though there are very few things i can say about the actual game which are really negative maybe that your witcher has to be a cleptomanic as who steals everything which isnt nailed down to use it in the very innovative crafting system or that one of the new mini games a card game named gwent steals way too much time of actual playing since its addictional content but all this fades against the atmosphere of a warridden novigrad where beggars and s meddle with fanatics and witch hunters conclusio this really sets new standards for open world as well as roleplay games imo definitive recommendation not only for fans of geralt,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,note at the time of this review i have completed every entry of the witcher franchise other than hearts of stone and blood and wine for the witcher 3 this review to some extent assumes you have played tw1 amp tw2 overview,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,130 hours to complete the game and i am ready to go for round 2 the witcher 3 was a beautiful game that had epic moments and great dialogue from the beginning to end the voice acting was superb and the music was memorable yet there are some problems with some of the combat and some parts that downright broke immersion a fantastic and great game that is almost perfect except for a few issues and immersion breaking elements the review i did was so extensive i cant even fit it on this steam review ill throw down a tldr for you guys out there but you can check the review video at the bottom if you want more in depth review thank you for taking your time to read this pros,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,a cautious recommendation for now,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,seeing as my socalled review got some attention and a few haters i decided to write a proper one,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,witcher games are like adult movie with a good story you went for the boobies but stayed for the plot and lambert with eskel finally repaired that stairs 9810,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,there are on occasion certain convergences and synergies that give rise to human creations destined to transcend and expand the role and scope of art and storytelling thats when these creations border on myth what distinguishes them is that they are not exclusively the work of a single mastermind instead they become collaborations that span across years decades and encompass the minds of several artists writers visionaries such is the nietzschean mythology of dcmarvel superheroes such is the darwinist mythology of planet of the apes and such is the slavictolkienian saga of the witcher my personal maxim when it comes to games is gameplay is king story is queen i have little to no interest in games with no story or even lore and also no interest in games with only story id rather read a book in that case the seamless combination of both is what interests me the most and very few games achieve this blend as wild hunt has achieved this game is the embodiment of the perfect balance between gameplay and story cdpr the developer has achieved the highest effect a game can have on its players making them wish that it never ends for the last five months i have delayed and put off the ending as long as i possibly could wishing that this game could last forever that i could play it for the rest of my life always finding new side quests new contracts new treasure hunts but alas all great things must end its what makes them great and in this case the witcher series ended on an incredibly high note the fact that the developer has decided to conclude the story of geralt with this game instead of finding a way to milk the franchise also speaks volumes of their integrity as artists this is a game that is exuberantly alive it bustles and teems with life walking through the woods walking through a city into a cave you feel life around you especially if you play with a good headset the feeling of riding across the lands as the sun sets is something ill never forget id never played a game that felt so alive so rich so handcrafted in its minutest details some games came close but probably due to limitations of technology and development cycle they didnt achieve this level of liveliness and exuberance i usually dont like cutscenes in most games to be very honest but in this game i couldnt get enough of it the voice acting the character animation especially facial animation is beyond anything weve come to expect from games in terms of quality and most games now pale in comparison seeming lifeless and dull no wonder some critics said that it defines nextgen this game is technically and artistically unparalleled and it should set a gold standard to be aspired to by all aaa devs in the coming years not that most of them will ever achieve something this great but they should at least aspire to greatness there are moments where its writing is at its best the fewer words are used geralt and ciri trashing a certain place was particularly brilliant but the writing here is among the best a game has ever seen from my own personal preference only the writing in fallout new vegas could equal the writing in wild hunt the variety of soundbites in cities and villages the different personalities ascribed to vendors a blacksmith mourning his son an armourer who is not what he seems a grumpy merchant etc etc etc from the very first quests the inner life shown by these characters is simply staggering a lone hunter in the woods a very minor character who considers himself a freak has more inner life than most protagonists in most games out there this brings us to the question of empathy here we feel such empathy for these characters even as we know that they are nothing but a complex arrangement of ones and zeroes technically speaking and we feel for even the most despicable among them such as the bloody baron only in tv series such as the sopranos and breaking bad have i felt such empathy for men whom i would personally loathe if i ever came across them this is topnotch writing in action we care for the characters in such a way that its hard to hold back the tears at certain points in the story the only complaint i have as some others have as well is that the main villains are not as developed as they could be imlerith and eredin in particular could have been much more interesting as even minor characters came out more interesting than them especially compared to letho the villain in assassins of kings the villains here are very flat it is a minor complaint though in the grand scheme of the game on to the gameplay the investigation component though not exactly innovative is employed so deftly that it makes for one of the most satisfying elements in the game finding clues and picking up scents is just fun and it makes you feel like a supernatural detective i know some players had objections to the combat but i have no complaints whatsoever especially on higher difficulties it is clever tactical challenging and just plain fun you dont have to mash your buttons or click your mouse to death here instead you have to pace yourself prepare for each fight try to get the right oils and signs and bombs ready it can be awkward sometimes but thats a matter of skill the better you become at combat the more surgical and graceful you can become which makes it extremely fun and satisfying as an rpg well purists may argue that the witcher series in general is not a true rpg because you will always be geralt of rivia you will always be bound and limited by his personality skills and fighting style yes true enough but within these bounds there is a freedom to build a character that is unique not only in the dialogue choices that ultimately impact the story but in the way you approach the world and what you do with it in terms of mechanics i have had no problems whatsoever not a single crash only some very minor and mildly amusing glitches as i said before this game is technically unparalleled cdprs engine is the perfect expression of clarkes third law advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic apart from some shoddy textures here and there the game is truly magical in its beauty and scope it is an open world without invisible walls where the sky and the oceans are the limits the soundtrack is a work of art in itself for the past two months ive started reading the books while listening to the soundtrack and it makes for a very satisfying combination it fills you with longing and transports you to the world of the witcher while your body sits there in the bus going to work or wherever it is that good seriously flawed as only the greatest masterpieces can be wild hunt is a tour de force to be reckoned with it is a world built by some of the most creative and innovative minds in the games industry it is a game carved and handcrafted as a labour of love with only the varnish of commercial value wild hunt redeems the videogame medium it elevates art and storytelling to a whole new level that we can only hope will come to be imitated however imperfectly this is an abridged version the full version is here

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,day 1 review pros no crashes beautiful graphics seriously runs smooth on a midrange machine topnotch atmosphere cons i havent seen boobs yet actual initial impressions will continue to update relevant specs i7 2600k 44ghz gtx 680 w 4gb ram 8gb ram windows 81 actual pros performance on my system has been better than expected 5060fps 1080p i am running postprocessing and the majority of the graphics options on high i have the haireffect turned off as it does degrade my fps the world feels alive from the wind blowing through the trees to the dynamic weather system to the wild life running through the forest nothing stands out as generic or as an asset that was placed into the world without thought the first two areas are more organic than any other game i have personally played the sidequests are varied and offer up much more than fetch this or kill that many are investigation based and require multiple steps to complete the ui has taken a massive step forward from the witcher 2 what was once a clunky mess is now fairly intuitive and streamlined there is room for improvement but clearly the developers have learned from their past mistakes the graphics are beautiful but please dont expect a fully modded skyrim or icenhancer gta4 level of detail again the developers seemed to be more concerned with making a world that feels organic and vivid than throwing 24k textures on everything its the art color and texture cohesion that really makes the graphics standout from other titles the dialogue and voice acting are on par or better than most action rpgs i have recently played i have yet to encounter two npcs that i felt were using the same voice actor the only generic voice in the game is probably the protagonist but that is by design i have not encountered any bugs worth mentioning zero crashes and no broken quests is impressive for any game when compared to other recent major releases actual cons while the soundtrack and game ambiance are very well done the game suffers from sound balancing issues for example at certain times the sound level of voices will be much lower than everything else in the world forcing you to read the subtitles there is an overuse of stage setting minicinematics especially if you play in short bursts and load often there should be an option to skip these and instead be able to read the suggestion text during a loading screen level progression has been quite slow which has forced me to backpedal a bit from the main quest to play catchup this may be by design but placing you into an area that is for level 7 while you are only level 3 isnt the best choice imho bottom line i will continue to play the witcher 3 for the foreseeable future it offers a blend of dai and skyrimesque gameplay with its own unique lore dynamism and atmosphere that is truly enjoyable please feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments and i will do my best to answer them,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,better than fallout 4,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,im a witcher heard you wondering about my swords well ones for monsters the other for humans geralt of rivia tldr just play the game its perfect 1010 tldr the witcher 3 is one of the best games ive ever played to date probably the best i will ever play it is now the bar ive set for gaming and will forever compare this masterpiece when progressing through future games never has a game pushed me to want to discover the lore of the world and read the novels which are written by andrzej sapkowski everything about this rpg is fantastic it does have its flaws but it is as perfect as a game will ever be story from the get go the witcher sucked me into the world and really immersed me into the life of geralt of rivia the game is more than just the main quest although it is fantastically written and voice acted the little things such as the side quests are memorable and feel like you matter to someones life whether you are part of the quest or merely just an observer of the story every quest i took part of i ended single handedly or left feeling like i had an impact even walking away from an on going sub story never ended in my mind it felt more than just a quest it gave depth to the environment and the npcs living around my story in some cases the little stories which seemed very insignificant impacted my story each character was fleshed out and didnt feel unimportant and gave so much depth to the overall arc characters gained and lost were impactful choices i made were important and changed the story and its outcome for better or for worst gameplay the gameplay is most memorable exploration was always exciting and interesting no two missions feel the same finding npcs needing help brought life to the open world exploring hidden treasure points of power and enemy hideouts were brilliant and added to the experience at no point in the game did i feel bored or had nothing to do even with finishing the main campaign i still have to play gwent fufill the contactsside quests explore more secrets discover the dlc and replay on the deathmarch difficulty the character builds are varied and fun alchemy is important especially in the higher difficulties signs are fantastic mutators can change the play style of geralt and there are so many armour sets can be used to give specific buffs and skills to your build i feel like the movement took some getting used to and the swimming was just god awful but apart from that it was perfect graphics the witcher 3 looks gorgeous there were moments where i just hopped on roach and took in the view its brilliantly done and i can see myself going around taking screenshots later for my showcase i was able to run this game at 5060fps on high with a few setttings turned down and it just looked amazing one of the best looking games ive played thus far sound i listened to the ost before playing the game itself i fell in love with all the music and playing the witcher gave meaning to both the music and the game the emotion of the song really immersed me into the story fights felt epic with the music playing even walking through velen novigrad and skellige with the conversation buzzing the nature and the soft instrumentals were beautiful even after playing the game i still listen to the ost the voice acting is brilliant i loved all the characters overall i am not close to being finished with this game there is still so much to discover its going to forever be my favourite game this is exactly what games should be the attention to detail and the execution of the story was brilliant i wouldnt change a thing just fantastic 1010,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i liberated a town taken over by bandits and a peasant told me if i had a son i would name him geralt 1010,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,this game made me question life 10 yes i did pirate it but i bought if after pls forgive me cdpr,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,ill start with saying that this is the best game i have ever played this game is a masterpiece it should become a benchmark for all games the amount of love poured to this game is just amazing you can feel it while playing hell even by watching the trailers from the small little details theyve done like geralt beard that grows over time to the amazing landscapes and the just epic soundtrack cdpr went all out in every aspect and they should get all of the respect the graphics of this games is perfect and i think the best looking game atm and its not just the looks the atmosphere is just amazing i have no words some areas in the game are just so detailed and crafted its just art at its finest the gameplay itself is just so fun i loved every second of playing it i have to say though when you play it play on the death march difficulty hardest why because you need to play it like they intended to get ready before the fight taking potions load specific bombs and apply oils be more tactical when fighting the monsters the variety of the monsters is great and every battle feels different making you adjusting to each monster differently use different tactics on wraiths for example like placing a trap while fighting them because if you wont you barely scratch them when attacking or calming an alghoul before smacking him up because when he isnt calm he got spike shield and every time you hit him you get hit back and you will die very quickly and these are just 2 examples out of many more monsters and another thing i found very sweet is that the same monster looks differently when theyre at a higher level or at a different place in the world like a fouglet for example in the swamps he looks pretty plain but if you go to the skellige islands they look really different wearing horns this is just a small example of the love and small detail crafting that went into this game the quests and story i dont think that there is any other game with the amount of depth thats in this game even the sidequests are so complex and deep that they feel like their a main quest the amazing animations cutscenes and dialogs are made to prefection allowing you to live it and feel so in the game as if it was a movie there are 3 major ending and around 32 minor ending to specific characters and how the world changes this just gives you an example on how rich and complex the story is i can go on and on and keep on praising the game but i think you get my point tldr buy this game even at full price its worth it this game is masterpiece,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,havent seen family for days please tell them im ok edit year from now this game just keeps on giving,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,his beard grows in realtime 1110,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,every sidequest has a better story than skyrims and dai main quests,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,im the kind of person who doesnt like to hand out superlatives like best normally whenever you try to unpack best its normally hard to quantify or at worst empty rhetoric thats why i was so surprised with myself around ten hours into the witcher 3 wild hunt a question popped into my head is this the best game ive ever played i tried to dismiss it reframe it into something more subjective but the question wouldnt go away so i decided what the hell ill finish the game and ask myself that question again now that ive finished the story well i think it is from start to finish witcher 3 stands a full head and shoulders above every rpg ive played in almost every metric that matters to me it has the most fully realized open world ive ever experienced its story and characters are deep and compelling the game is immersive in ways i still can hardly believe its visuals are breathtaking the music is fantastic the amount of contentmeaningful content not flavorless side questsis staggering the world the current trend in openworld games seems to be using procedural generation to offer playable areas that are more than anyone could successfully explore in a lifetime but im sure youve played a few games that promise this and deliver a world thats wide as the ocean and shallow as a puddle witcher 3 is the opposite of this every inch of velen novigrad and skellige that you encounter is lovingly crafted this is one of the only games ive played besides elder scrolls games where you can literally set off in a random direction and find selfsustaining adventure tldr better game than no mans sky10 narrativecharacters the main story is fantastic the world of the witcher is noticeably cynical and the game uses this to its advantage the storys conflict hinges around very adult fears and uses very adult themes to drive these points home you spend the vast majority of the game looking for ciri geralts adopted daughter shes not held in some magic crystal trapped but otherwise safeyou dont know whats happened to her all you can do is search and hope for the best the characters you meet both supporting characters and general npcs are excellent theyre wellwritten wellvoiced and wellanimated and its a joy listening to them and hearing more about their stories the story is branching but the amazing part is that i cant tell you by how much normally its readily apparent in games with choices where exactly the story branches but this game does an excellent job at hiding the seams the consequences of your decisions arent readily apparent until sometimes hours of playtime after you make them tldr feels10 immersion i read reviews before buying this and people kept saying the game was immersive i didnt believe that at first but after playing the game i can confirm that its the strongest point of the game you really do feel like geralt of rivia an itinerant monster slayer who often gets wrapped up in things larger than the path he walks you feel like you have his powerssuperhuman senses reflexes and an encyclopedic knowledge of supernatural monsters that the commonfolk only know in myths the game is huge on player agency allowing you to use what you know to solve problems as best you can its hard not to feel immersed when youre using your witcher senses to identify distant threats by sound immersive narrative after youve played a lot of games that allow you to make decisions you start recognizing tropes if you unlock a special dialogue option take itnothing bad will happen if someone tells you theyre misunderstood they normally are very early in the game i let rules like this influence my decision and the game slapped my wrist for it i blinked but i didnt listen and tried again on a more major plot point the game punched me in the after that i stopped trusting people at face value i became willing to refuse people who i thought were lying to me i started making decisions as geralt of rivia instead of someone playing a video game i almost always play rpgs as neutral good doing what i think is right and helping everyone i possibly can whether they deserve it or not the fact that a game could make me change this is absolutely massive tldr im a witchman10 content i already talked about how much there is to do in the world but it deserves a special mention that this game is priced at 50 my total runtime for completion of the main story quest and maybe 6070 of sidequests and exploration was around 120 hours none of that time was grinding for money experience anything of the sortjust pure adventure ive played aaa games for 60 that didnt have 14th the content this one does not to mention the myriad of free dlc the game comes with and the absolutely massive expansion packs that ive at the time of this writing just barely dipped my toes in it really boggles the mind and makes you wonder what some of these other video game companies even think theyre doing after playing this game if it was priced at 90 or even 100 id still say it was worth it and i didnt even mention gwent tldr i owe cd projekt red money10 audiovisual the game is beautiful and runs exceptionally i dont normally focus on graphics because its more important to me that a game have a defined visual style but witcher 3 has one and its beautiful the music is excellent as well carrying the desperation of life in velen the somber song of skellige and the carefree life for some of novigrad combat this is the only part of the game that doesnt sparkle as brightly it almost doesnt feel fair to say that as combat in this game is very good it just didnt dazzle me like the rest i began to outlevel the foes id encounter while exploring which trivialized combat the game has a very good crafting and skill system to bolster your combat but when the combat itself didnt stress me i didnt feel much of a need to come up with clever solutions to problems ive upped the difficulty for my playthrough of the expansions so if i need to adjust this section later i will all in all this game is a masterwork id recommend it to anyone who likes rpgs even a little bit and for the foreseeable future if anyone asks me what the best game ive ever played is i will say the witcher 3 wild hunt,1,1

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,i liked taking walks to watch the sunrise and sunset before i purchased this game now i just bask in the beautiful sun rising and setting over the northern realm 10010 seriously this game is ridiculously good it definitely sets apart from other games in rpg actually in my honest opinion this game should be a genre of its own the story telling is ineffably amazing even the decisions you made in witcher 2 can alter the universe in witcher 3 thats just mind blowing i am definitely going to finish witcher 2 after completing witcher 3 then replay witcher 3 with the saved files and see how different witcher 3 will be the quests in this game are always changing and exciting i am a big fan of rpgs and have played several rpgs including skyrim fallout etc but have always felt the stories were not captivating enough i fell in love with this game after putting in 1015 hours doing main and supplementary quests slaying monsters on easy mode as i picked up the game mechanics i have put in now 50 hours into the game over the past 5 days and have never felt bored or repetitive and i dont even think i am halfway through the game yet each quest has a storyline that really hooks and connects you to the universe of the witcher series whether its a main quest or a side quest heck ive done some quests that literally feature everything you can think of slaying vampire drunken sex with a transgendered elf accidental of course staging a play watching somebody performing an autopsy and many many more lastly i am no english major but i find the writing in this game sensational reading glossary on different characters and monsters and listening attentively to the dialogue are extremely satisfying and enjoyable even the love letter you looted from a corpse or note collected from a throng of bandits are worthwhile to read thoroughly and who freaking knew there could be so many kinds of monsters specters ogroids insectoids draconids etc after this game if there ever was an apocalypse i definitely will be the monster slayer guru if you are still for some reason wondering whether to pick up this game i hope youll find this review helpful i seriously think this game is worth a lot more than 60 and i was happy to preorder this game for 54 i am definitely picking up the dlcs tldr game is amazingly wellwritten through both main and side quests game developers were very thorough pick up this game edit finished the game at 85 hours definitely was an emotional roller coaster to say the least spent the following hour wandering around to finish random side quests but couldnt do it felt so empty decided to buy witcher 1 on steam at full price to play the game despite its clunky mechanism as well as the books and the comics also found out 16 free dlcs will be released before heart of stone definitely worth the purchase down to every penny now back to applying for jobs,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,1st read the books if you can 2nd this is the best game of all time,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,first let me summarize the negative reviews for you i am mad about the hype around this game so im not recommending it because insert reason here the reasons could be somewhat confuse character control game too easynot hardcore enough simple combat my pc cant run it on ultra at 144 fps now to the actual review of the game from the beginning this game is absolutely gorgeous i spent a good time checking the visuals everywhere i went the world really feel like real like you could address locations by pointing trees along the way everything looks handmade and original the story is another thing this game does wonderfully i nearly cried sometimes no shame in it and got really excited in some sequences the storytelling and the cinematic are godtier this is by far the best aspect of the game controls and combat system are different from tw2 the combat got easier for the newcomers i guess and requires less strategy although the combat was made simpler it is not boring at all and the difficulty is adjustable so the strategy becomes neccessary sometimes the controls as opposite as some people say i did not find bad i played tons of games and i am always ready to get used to different movement mechanics in short the game was fun and kept me motivated from start to finish i would recommend this masterpiece to every gamer i know i wish every game was like that i would give it a 1010 because i have absolutely nothing to complain about the game itself i found some bugs but they did not compromise my overall experience and the patches were quick and effective 10 out of 10 waiting for expansions,1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,triss merigold makes this game awesome,1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,1010 an outstanding masterpiece ive put a lot of time into this franchise ive read all the books and ive now played all the games honestly i think cd pr red has done a better job with the franchise than sapokowski himself anyways here are some proscons from my perspective cons quite a bit of glitches but still nothing compared to what games like skyrimfallout has lack of scaling after the first 10 levels the game is very easy even on the hardest difficulty using time on potions oils etc seems pointless as you progress into the game ng doesnt really deal with this well controls can be a bit clunky drunk steed some points of interest seems forced rushed and ultimately a not so much interesting point pros extremely good voice acting one of the best open worlds in a game the leveldesign is splendid imo the best characters in any game it is simply stunning how well the characters are made the greatest strength of the game you quickly tie an emotional bond to the characters and all the main characters are very interesting and complex how about a round of cards gwent specifically brilliant soundtrack combat is versatile interesting and challenging first levels are very hard though variety of different signs and weapons to use expect something along the lines of dark souls in terms of moveset excellent graphics and mostly very good optimization i have a 980 and can do about 30 fps in 4kmostly 60 fps in 1080 but when it rains in the swamp it goes down to like 30 for some reason this is one of the few games where nvidias 4k setting really shines as the textures in 1080p seem like garbage in comparisoncheck the trees theyre insane in 4k very good storytelling the main story will keep most people hooked through the entirety of the game i do wholeheartedly recommend to play tw2 before starting this howeverthe sidequests are the real surprise though as i dont think anyone has put so much effort into sidequests in a game this big before they are awesome the sheer scale of the game it is simply ridicolous i have spent about 130 hours in the game on a playthrough if you only care about the story and play on easy the game will take around 3545 hours free dlcs actual expansion packs whats not to like mod support with sortof ok mod tools beard choices in the game have a very great impact on the outcome of the endings for those who read the books the devs have done a good job putting in references here and there also a lot of references to books movies games etc in general you will chuckle my verdict i have had so much fun with this game one of the very few games that have managed to get to me emotionally it has without a doubt become one of my favourite games of all time its hard to put my finger on too many negative things here there is a lot that could have been done better sure but compared to other games i dont think a game has to be perfect to achieve a perfect score and based on the immensely enjoyable time ive had with this game i give it a solid 1010 i have played about 500 games and this is the 2nd game i can give a 1010 rating i wholeheartedly recommend to play witcher 2 first as you will get considerably more out of the game witcher 1 has horrible combat and is very very hard to get through i honestly wouldnt even try it until after tw3,1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,call of duty black ops iii is a game which i was actually thoroughly enjoying the gun play and new mechanics added an interesting twist on the call of duty series i am however not going to write this as a positive review simply because the game has marked me as cheating firstly i havent even touched the multiplayer mode of black ops iii anyone who reads my reviews or checks my profile will see i have absolutely no interest in the multiplayer side of this type of game i was playing the single player campaign in offline mode secondly i wouldnt even know how to cheat even if i wanted to but one matter which really irks me is even if i was cheating in singleplayer mode why would anyone get a ban for that in the first place surely bans from playing multiplayer games should come when you play multiplayer people who know me will know i am not that sort of person where as people who read this will probably think i am just throwing my toys out of the pram believe who you wish at the end of the day heed my warning though due to the lack of any support from steam or treyarch themselves this will be the absolutely last call of duty game i ever buy review or even lay my eyes on after doing some research into the matter many people have been experiencing this issue even people who play online who just happen to be on a server with a cheater have received a ban as well im sorry treyarch take your game back to the consoles toms score card 1 stay away 2 not recommended 3 only recommended when on sale 4 recommended 5 highly recommended 6 this is a must play if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up if you would also like to follow my reviews more easily be sure to join my group by clicking here,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,activsion has done it again black ops 3 is out and wait whats this more maps to buy already well if thats what it will take to enjoy the game no one should have to spend more than the hefty price of 60 to get enough out of a game for them to enjoy it its not that its not a fun game it is and can be as anyone who has played a cod game before knows but once again activision and treyarch have thought it a good idea to charge the triple a price for a game that really doesnt have all that much content yes go ahead and call me whatever you like are you done now once again i dont hate the game its relatively fun like any fps but my gd when will devs learn see instead of trying to help the games negative and overall mixed reviews eas little brother has opted for simply making a subpar game better at a price again if a free game on steam has a mostly negative review only the most idiotic developer would start charging 10 bucks for it and expect that to make the reviews start changing for the better logic right dont get me wrong i have no problem with dlcs when they are done well and simply add more to the base game that it already great and not lacking skyrim is a pretty good example of this the base game is great as it is but if you want to sink more hours in go ahead and pick up a dlc a not so great example is like elitedangerous an overall mixed set of reviews for understandable reasons frontiers devs for elitedangerous decided that instead of improving the game to make it more enjoyable by simply updating it which i truly believe would have been a much more profitable and appealing way to expand the game than charging more money for a season pass for a base game that really doesnt have too much going for it that unfortunately is precisely what they did and will most likely continue to do i understand not every developer and game is gonna be like warframe where there is always new updates and almost always completely free to some extent there is a line that line is exactly what games and publishers like black ops 3 and activision cross you dont make a game with one zombie map and charge extra for more when customers already spent up to 60 dollars on your game you dont keep adding more content for a price when the game simply needs it as an update to make it better you want to improve your reviews activision instead of demanding more money for less content simply start adding more content and build up to the point where there is enough to do that people enjoy your game as it is then youll release dlc and people will be a whole lot more open to the idea of putting in more money for a game they already enjoy not putting in more money so they finally do enjoy and no games oozing with microtransactions no just no your games wont fix themselves i get that activision isnt gonna change and most developers that opt for poor marketing techniques wont but its things like charging more than 60 for 2 games one being a remaster and the other one a game no one really wants that you must buy in order to recieve the remaster that customers cant stand while some people are more than happy to shell out more money for your games to which i have no problems with most would rather spend half the cost of 60 and take their money elsewhere its really not the game i dont like its how they market and sell everything they make at the end of the day black ops 3 is a relatively good game and if there were a meh option instead of yes or no as far as recommendations go i wouldve opted for that i really just wish they would add another map or two to zombies i mean come on they even tag it under zombies i would easily recommend this game if it were on sale but as for full price i would say its not for everyone simple as that dont like it great like it great,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,call of duty black ops iii here are the ratings of the international press now available for windows pc call of duty black ops iii receives ratings from international criticism as you can see from the list below the new chapter of shooter published by activision has been judged positively by the press egm 95 gametrailers 92 gameinformer 9 playstation lifestyle 9 ausgamers 88 destructoid 85 sixthaxis 8 gamesradar 45 the escapist 45 polygon 7 gamespot 7 giant bomb 35 misleading todays review call of duty black ops iii overview so like every year you can expect 2 things for sure 1 assassins creed game and 1 call of duty game they will just keep going until they run out of ideas or ppl stop buying from them essentially this game takes part in 2054 i think and you become part of the black ops unit an augmented elite force that uses a new kind of techonology somethinig related to your dni to performe different types of things like hacking comunicating and other things this review contains no spoilers of the story dont worry so theres 3 parts of this review singleplayer you cant pick weapons during that campaign that belongs to enemies from the floor the story takes place in the year 2054 it seems that a new cold war its going on and an event set in the start of game trying bioaugmentation on humans neural implantations bionic arms etc and for the first time you get to see how your character looks like you will be also called player the rpg part of the game were you get to choose your face its extremly limited so dont except more than 8 faces and they all pretty much looks like the same your gender and thats it the sp its pretty fun full of enemies to shoot walls to run over robots to explode drones to hack the bad thing is the campain also the mp its riddle with bugs mostly annoying i havent finished yet but its like any cod except for mw2 a rather generic story pulled of the 10 minutes imagination time of an 14 years old but hey its cod were here for the multiplayer a few big steps were made for this mode but at this point some keep not being made like no dedicated servers and smaller maps the good thing is that the mp its pretty fun if you make the game to work and you cant wallrun on every wall there are like 1 like obvious wall to run and the rest are just like to practice parkour because theres really no need to use it and most walls dont even work to do this you might end up using that a bit specialst are new to the franchise you basically get to choose 1 specialist having each 1 a special ability that i think its unlocked after a few minutes played because its not related to the scorestreak and a different character can be tuned to look a bit different also you have the scorestreaks weapon customization and everything thats already there which leads me to the zombies mode perhaps this is the best part of this game because its really so crappy that theres actually nothing really good about it zombies mode feature something like an experiment or something where 4 ppl guilty of murdering someone are taken and placed somewhere when they are surrounded by zombies and you get this new ability to pressing a button on a machine turn out into something like the thing from the darkness 2 for a breif period of time to ravage enemy zombies the mode its still pretty hard if played alone which encourages players to join with friends it has a film noir ambient set in the 50s but with new weapons and the base game only includes 1 map plus nuketown if you preorder pretty fun but nothing really new pros great soundtrack music its really immersive great graphics if you have the powerful rig the game needs to run with them decent story i think fun mp somekind of new zombies mode specialists cons terrible port poorly optimized fps drops constantly memory leak cpu usages its broken and consume the whole cpu stuttering utter and completly annoying to play happends every 3 or 4 seconds slowdowns on cinematics my advice for you now is dont buy this game was obviously focused on the releases of the consoles and its a terrible pc port as of its now the game looks like an early alpha and i strongly suggest you wait until a sale or at least a few weeks or a month to wait for treyarch to adress the main issues with it metascore 51100,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,this game would have potential if the company behind it actually gave a about the game and not just about money the community is dead already on many gamemodes and i cant blame them youd think this game is still in beta if you played it full of game breaking bugs and the hitboxes are worse than ever before whenever there is an update all they seem to do is add extra t content to the game where you can spend your money on this company never gave a about the community and i guess they never will to sum it all up for you guys bad hitboxes at times more than previous cod games laggy at times framedrops buggy random disconnects and graphical issues for many players updates are more about extra money generating content than actually fixing the game small community every game i play i see at least 4 people i know majority of the community are just a bunch of raging kids same as at least the last 5 games needs a highend system and still runs like if you have one results vary though they didnt balance the weapons properly shotguns and thermal dingo kids all over the place activision sometimes permabans people that never cheated in this game and never say why the dlc maps are only playable in limited gamemodes without the ability to play original maps they actually seem to ban cheaters if you send evidence to the right place the gameplay is fun if you actually find a lobby or get to play without issues or dingo kids cool weapon emblem and character customization options black ops ii was the last proper game they made and times like modern warfare 1 and 2 are long gone the game reminds me more of cybermonkeys in space than the oldschool call of duty games the only reason i still play this is because of my clan and the fact that boii has almost no players at all im praying to god that the upcoming remake of mw1 will be decent or else this game will be the last of my 6000 hour cod journey,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,context ive been playing call of duty since world at war though i skipped advanced warfare for lack of a platform to play it on i considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark so when i built my own pc i couldnt really resist the chance to play another treyarch zombies experience so heres a little on the game modes my lack of experience with advanced warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options bear that in mind campaign maybe its because im getting older but by god this was the worst story ive played so far black ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise this time the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission assuming youre paying attention im not sure what the message theyre trying to get across in this game is but its a wholy unsatisfying experience and by the 6th mission i was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so i could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end youre not fighting a war because its never really explained who youre fighting for the game is one big game of chase paul taylor around the world and by world i mean singapore and egypt level diversity isnt present here and level design while obviously catered to the new movement mechanics isnt fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality the campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh but it doesnt really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games no matter how linear the weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too as theyre just point at person make them stop shooting you for a bit of time which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room the campaign is needlessly padded with customisation to add this illusion of content when its easier to just use the preset loadouts for each level a boring experience with no payoff bland characters and far too linear shooting playing this made me want to play black ops 1 the main problem i find with these overly futuristic installments is that theyre not believable enough to immerse yourself in and atmosphere is completely non existant i hope they finally ditch this future its been 4 years take me back to world war 2 already zombies i played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good the whole easter egg thing was nice at first giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras like maybe all the perks on the map but this is ing absurd you have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features and its just a huge chore honestly you pretty much have to do it as well unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15 once again they compromised level design in favour of ly complicated story not to mention the bland cast of literal whos voiced by expensive actors throwing back to call and mob of the dead but i never liked those ones anyway kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own the giant which is still the best map or unless you bought the season pass its pulled an assassins creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it ive lost track of everything at this point the worst part as mentioned is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts shadows of evil is boring to play tedious and poorly designed i havent played a map as bad as this since shangrila the giant a reskin of der reise still stands the test of time however the new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point the map has not changed whatsoever besides randomisation of perk locations and a few small easter eggs that dont take forever to do the mechanic of packapunching your weapon twice was introduced in the first black ops and added generic attatchments to your weapon but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an aoe for example finally the gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the pack a punch in the original der reise a fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable extremely powerful ones such as spawning an ammo box on command are gated behind a drop system which reeks of a microtransaction system that was probably removed at the last second as usual ill be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement but if youre going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern zombies then youll be disappointed multiplayer and i thought league of legends had mobility creep yet here we are there are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot which is actually pretty nice because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area sliding jumping wallrunning all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game ill stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game in terms of balance it feels like theyve gone for the mw2 approach whereby if everything is disgustingly op then nothing is which isnt actually a bad thing smgs are still far too powerful sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence and for once the shotguns arent garbage melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill which i feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed however you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly leading to a lot of knife only players maps are well designed around movement but other than that theyre pretty weak none of them are fun or satisfying to play and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever all the maps are medium sized and theres no real diversity like back in mw2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones nothing is unique its all grey again and devoid of colour which sorely disappointed me however as usual multiplayer is ing overflowing with content and its easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what like battlefront gets away with charging 40 for theres loads to unlock accomplish and use every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more yet theres still no real reason to prestige this amount of content makes the game feel worth it in the same way a 50 box of 50 sweets is worth it but youll get bored of the same sweet eventually conclusion if youve never liked call of duty this game wont do anything to change that couple the complete lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small pc playerbase and uninspired themes i feel like this is one of the weakest call of duty games ever and i enjoyed ghosts in its current state i find it hard to reccomend as what you get is a lot of content but its all frustrating and ultimately worthless the running joke has always been that call of duty is always the same but this is no more obvious than in this installment feels like a mediocre sidegrade of advanced warfare if youre reading reviews for a cod game youre not the primary market dont buy this also do me a favour and dont comment below my inbox is filling and i dont give a about what you have to say,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,in the current state that this game is in i cant really recommend this game heck the beta was smoother than the official launch of this game i know its only day 1 but consumers cant fall into that dude its day 1 theyre going to release a patch anyway right attitude buying broken games at launch and hoping the devs fix it later is pretty pathetic the publisher has got your money now but will release poor ports like this one and fix it later after they cashed in on your money,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,2016 is the year when doom has zero mod support lacks basic dm server browser and got antitampering drm on top and call of duty got split screen server browser and even full fledged editor pcgaming an unexpected journey,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,low fps poor optimization do not buy,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,one of the worst multiplayer but some oddly shaped addictive at the same time zombies still is and will forever be the real reason i buy treyarch cod games,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,stay away from this game till its patched the performance is very bad its like as if they never took qa into account during the beta since most of the problems still exist from beta,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,ghost killed cod for me aw buried cod in the ground bo3 is digging cod out of the ground 1010,1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,dlc only has hardcore moshpit and no hc team deathmatch dlcs are useless,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,it is quite late for me to be making a review for this game but better late than never black ops iii is a very solid call of duty game the best one yet in recent years if i do say so myself contentwise this game has enough stuff to keep you busy for a long long time and im going to tell you why 1 campaign true to treyarch fashion the campaign is a complete mind you thought you understood it but then boom it hits you with a plot twist so deep m night shyamalan couldnt even comprehend the amount of lore and detail that went into this game is unbelievable by cod standards that said the campaign doesnt come without flaws the story and characters have some poor design with a lot of characters that you are supposed to care for yet the game didnt attempt to make you feel it and just assume you do you feel disconnected at times from the story even though thats probably a good thing as youre supposed to be i cant say any further because that will spoil the story the campaign doesnt feature a lot of familiar actors but going along with more cult favorites such as christopher meloni katee sackhoff and ben browder who maybe more familiar to those who are fans of series like law and order battlestar galactica and stargate sg1 for the most parts the actors did a good job in their portrayal of the characters which is to be expected my only concern is the lack of identity for the player character which again fits with the plot that treyarch is trying to portray but a last name like mason wouldve sufficed gameplaywise this is the most indepth cod campaign yet with full level progression for your character guns and equipment with a variety of unlocks to truly acquire 100 completion in this campaign can take you a serious amount of time but its worth every single second for those who love a good challenge and you can even play the campaign coop with up to 4 players so the experience is even more fun 2 multiplayer if you love black ops ii mp and you love advanced movements youll love black ops iii mp the chainbased movement system made by treyarch is very fluid and easy to master in comparison to the exo system provided by sledgehammer games in advanced warfare players have better control of the movement which makes for a more relaxing experience in theory the specialists are a very nice addition though unbalanced at times for the game its very surprising to see treyarch build an entire lore and backstories for each specialist giving them their own identity rather than random soldier 76 winkwink but of course this game is also the start of the moneymaking train called cod points by now you should probably know about this microtransaction currency which you use to buy supply drops ingame to open for a chance of good loot it doesnt sound too bad until they start adding weapons into the loot pool pretty much every new gun and melee weapon are locked behind supply drops so if youre unlucky you may never see a new weapon in your time of playing this game however dont be too discouraged as the game does have a contract challenge that will provide you with supply drops that guarantee at least one gun and one melee weapon and one more for each when you buy the season pass the dlc maps are also well done with old maps being remade to fit the movement system definitely worth picking up the season pass for as of now the dlc maps are sadly only in tdm but i hope in the future treyarch will compose a moshpit playlist for all objective modes so that season pass owners can play objective modes on the dlc maps 3 zombies the heart of treyarchs games zombies is even more indepth than ever before the story is given way more attention this year with cinematic moments that youd only dream of in the campaign while retaining the mystery and crypticness of treyarch all around it it was such a pleasure to see how zombies developed from a simple survival game mode to the complex easter eggcentric cinematic mode that it is today it was also pleasant to see the return of the favorite quartet of zombies the original 4 as the main characters kicking and saving the world however it does irk me that the game isnt as zombiefocused as it should be with the introduction of mythical forces in the story the zombies become less and less important as the story progresses its not entirely a bad thing but it can have a negative effect on the state of the story as a whole a gamemode where originally zombies only existed due to a mysterious alien element gameplaywise zombies in black ops iii provides a lot of variety with special abilities called gobblegums that you can use as well as full weapon progression system the maps are also well designed as are the sidequests that is until the last two maps where the sidequests become random as all hell but all in all it was a fun exciting and epic journey even though the finale to the 8year saga couldve ended on a better note it was satisfying for me and i await to see what treyarch cooks up in 2018 4 pc version despite what you may have heard black ops iii is actually quite optimized on pc its just a bit more demanding than other cod games even infinite warfare due to some design decisions as with previous titles treyarch pays a lot of attention in giving pc gamers a good experience while not straying too far from the console experience though there are certain things i dont necessarily agree with on their work like completely separating pc balancing from console bo3 is still a solid pc game that deserves to be played as of the time this review goes live mod tools have already been out for over a month and the community has published a lot of great content if you loved custom zombies in world at war youll love custom zombies in bo3 overall treyarch didnt disappoint me with bo3 it was everything i expected it to be and more did it come up short at certain parts yes but the goods outweigh the bads for me black ops iii will remain one of my top 5 favorite cod games in a long time,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,this game inspired me to play other games,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,technical issues profound constantly resets microphone level to random values serious lockups when playing unable to close game without reset resets audio devices major camera stutter when running and turning at the same time,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,currently unplayable on many computers with i5 cpu update a patch has been pushed across however it hasnt changed anything for me personally and by the looks of things many others if anyone is considering buying this game i would highly recommend waiting until the issues are solved if they ever do get solved activision support have not been helpful as well waiting 30 minutes in a chat to eventually get told that uninstalling the drivers for my headset should fix the issue is not helpful and extremely frustrating,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,freezes lag massive fps issues all in menus and in campaign game does not run or respond well on i5 systems and treyarch knows it but is offering minor cosmetic potential fixes that dont work for everyone mgs5 and mad max run flawlessy on my system at max and i run a gtx 980 inexcusable for these issues to exist dont buy until patched and maybe not even then,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,no spoiler in this review the latest episode in call of duty franchise continuing the story from waw bo1 and bo2 the time is setting in the future 2065 all the scifi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality generally the main menu is fabulous you may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds and you can locally play with friends in splitscreen support both vertical or horizontal split this is very cool if you want to play together locally the game breaks into 3 big modes campaign multiplayer and zombies in bo3 all these modes are quite decent individually moreover all 3 modes are well connected such as in multiplayer mode you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in campaign mode most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes and in each mode you have your own progress they all have levels achievements and statistics separately besides all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends campaign and zombies mode both support coop up to 4 players another awesome part is the customizations and the media community most of the fps game such as battlefield series allow players to decorate their guns with camo and also have custom emblems for creative players to show themselves in bo3 each custom emblem support up to 64 layers which means you could create almost anything you want furthermore you may also fully customize your weapons with camo and paint job even clan tag or kill counter if you got prestige these customizations are not only for you to please yourself you can upload your sick guns the to ingame media community all the bo3 players could see your works and rate them even download them if they like it so the customization and social functionality is quite robust in bo3 screenshots sharing coming soon in order to clearly express my opinion i will review bo3 mode by mode campaign,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,crashes entire computer when trying to run the game cant get passed the activision logo without screen going black,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,okay ive put this review off for a while now i think now that i have the time its probably worth me writing one ill try make it short sweet and straight to the point call of duty black ops 3 is a 5050 game in my opinion the mixed reviews show that too it has its pros and it has its cons however something is always drawing me back to this game whether its the frantic multiplayer or the captivating campaign but then again its made by activision most of their games follow that path ill start with the cons get the negativity out the way the community yeah you probably already knew about that the cod community is freaking awful that ruins it in my opinion it might not be everyone who is like that but i can assure you that at least 2 people in any match will be salty or toxic about something at some point its hard to avoid and if you find a nice lobby stay in it of course this is only on the multiplayer part of it not so much in zombies just the gamemodes the system requirements this game is reliant on fps youll probably see a tonne of reviews with these mentioned or people complaining that it doesnt run or load or work or their fps is 10 it does require a hell of a lot for it to be smooth with high fps or you can sacrifice all of the beauty in the game a very smooth look and some fps its a shame that this game requires so much for it to be look good and be 60fps because i enjoy the surroundings in game as well as the graphics but thats a personal preference in a shooter game you need the speed you need good fps so you have an advantage over your enemies and bo3 really does rely on that in certain situations like when youre shooting down a giant spider like mech and you have to skid out the way of a missile heading straight towards you or when youre head to head against others in a death match however for some people fps will be minimum and therefore your gameplay will be very different to someone with a strong pc keep reading for a major fps fix the seriousness of it or lack of it personally i dont mind the lack of seriousness in the multiplayer and what i mean by seriousness is if you were to play some of activisions older games youd see a verrrry clear difference between this of bo3 or cod ghosts for example black ops 3 is a rather futuristic take on the bo3 franchise more so than the other 2 seriousness ceases to exist in multiplayer now that character customisation and highlight taunts have gone out the window youd know what i mean if you saw it basically if youre looking for a ominous and stealthy multiplayer where youre crawling through mud and ash to get to the objective it definitely is not this try battlefield 1 instead because i know for a fact that if you score the most by the end of the game on bf1 your character doesnt dab or do the whip amp naynay or does some other form of viral something bo3 is full of memes the dlcs this is straight forward just dont buy them if you want to play the new and different multiplayer maps online they are dead like in most games where they release dlc only maps no one is on them much however if you want to play this game for the zombies id say its worth it the dlc maps for zombies are rather enthralling and different also theres is a large amount of people playing on them the multiplayer scaling yeaap its pretty crap i dont need to explain how bad it can be theres days where it will be perfect there is a good mix of ranks and prestiges on both sides and you have a fair fun game or theres other days where you get put on the weak team and you get absolutely slaughtered and you come out with a low 3kills27deaths thats never fun plus you cant always avoid it by leaving the lobby and joining a new one cause theres a high chance youll get put into a team with 3 vs 6 and the 6 are all max prestige zooming around the map and obliterating everything alright i think i covered most of what i think lets the game down a lot now onto the pros the campaign i wont spoil anything dont worry personally i really enjoyed the campaign it takes you on exciting and tiring missions youre always in your feet or in the sky doing something the seriousness that lacks in multiplayer has to be somewhere its very immersive and emotional at times and during my play through i found myself getting attached to the different characters as well as my own youre not a backseat brain ayour character that you dont see never hear but somehow they manage to save everyone and they rule the day youre play as a very proactive strong independent individual black op i found that i was drawn to them and you really take a front seat also the ability to customise yourself and your weapons is still there not to mention finding collectibles hidden within each level will be scattered and placed in your room and over time your room will become a mini museum okay okay i like the campaign and i could keep rambling on but thats not fun zombiesss i havent actually played zombies all that much nor do i have any of the dlcs i know others who have them and really enjoy them though but from what ive seen and experienced i can tell you it was pretty damn fun its creepy ominous endless and noisy ill be honest i havent a clue how to solo it so if youre interested in zombies more than anything else id suggest watching some gameplay or look for a review about it zombies is a mode that is fun to play with friends or alone one slip up or being in be wrong place at the wrong time could get you killed and eventually will 3 hits and youre dead meat its very different from other cod zombie modes that and it makes it unique in many ways i also love the style of the default zombie map its like bioshock mixed with zombies the atmosphere music and graphics i can keep this one short and sweet kinda all gamemodes have a nice atmosphere to them by that i mean there is a lot of detail thats been put into the maps story lines and characters it has a nice feel to it the music well i love music in games thats something i look for in games actually but thats another personal preference however all modes have their own music and it has been made to fit in to work simply it sounds great and it sets a scene indeed now onto the graphics if you read what i put above in cons you know what im going to say the graphics are amazing then resolution is high and crisp but yeah its a big but you can run the game in 4k and it feels like youre actually in that shoot out oooor you can run it in 1080p with acceptable fps and dream that your pc could handle 4k so im going to tell all of you dreamers a little trick that a friend of mine told me when i was close to giving up on hope with my bad fps nightmare all you have to do to achieve rather smooth gameplay and that advantage over others in multiplayer is turn down the render resolution under video in graphics to anything under than what its set at 60 50 etc theres a cache this makes your game look freaking awful buuuut you can play like a pro soooo i guess its 5050 doing this and turning down the textures will improve your fps by around 2030 okay you know what im going to bring this to a close i typed all this on a phone and so far its been like 2 hours or something i cant remember anymore i stopped noticing 50 words into typing this novel yes this was short and sweet to me overall ill recommend this game but its more about what youre looking for in games thankyou for reading my long freaking review that ive put off for a year i hope this helped you a bit i apologise if it didnt goodluck c,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,i had such high hopes for this game but with the obvious neglect of pc players who wants to pay 60 to a money hungry company like activision just opening the game you can see issues like frame stutters almost no online players and the fact it takes 10 minutes some times to join a server they also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys and i will be honest i have put almost 40 into crypto keys but i cant get over the fact that the servers are so bad less then 1 percent of players are on the dlc that i payed for really and me and my friends have had such crazy issues with the nat type and having a party for multiplayer if you are absoulutely set on buying this game do not buy the dlc honestly the worst money i have ever spent oh and one last thing prepare for the hardcore urge to rage you will get from all the broken guns and specialists and this whole thing was all in my opinion and if you guys dissagree you either havent bought this for pc yet or you are just another blind call of duty fan boy yours sadly josh,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,first of all i am not saying that game is bad if you are having fun with it good you deserve it so lets start my list 1 same thing over and over i played some mp and feel like i am playing mw3 with some titanfall ripoff but with poor parkour that is not what i should feel when i am playing new fps look at rainbow six siege it feels so fresh 2 50 usd season pass which delivers same old maps that old call of duty games had renewed maps arent bad as we saw in battlefield 4 however 50 usd season pass hase to be removed from game industry for same reason i didnt buy battlefront 2015 3 maps are limited this game has jetpacks and parkour however maps are limited and have invisible walls this is not acceptable in 2015 for a game that has modes bigger than 5v5 4 optimisation is great i suppose because it was running fine on my pc however graphics feels outdated as i mentioned i felt like i am playing mw3 5 easy to hack during my playtime i got 6 obvious cheaters out of 20 games they were shoting thhrought the wall even when i was unreachable no they had no vision ability probably it is because engine is too old for now 6 ethics after titanfall came out cod devs are trying to make similar game but why titanfall was first one and it is one of the best fps of the decade have some respect to yourselves guys so i could continue this list but i feel like no one is gonna read it then lol tldr make something new for us concept is great however it is poorly executed,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,video review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvppfhp2122eq summary the game is a broken mess i made a video on the day of release demonstrating the problems with the game since then the issues have no been fixed and i have found more the singleplayer is not only littered with performance problems but its probably the worst entry to the franchise so far zombies multiplayer matchmaking is extremely broken multiplayer is good with some minor improvements over previous games however i live in australia and am put in to lobbies with people in the us constantly which results in lag teleporting players and overall leaves the game unplayable for more please watch the video,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,right now this game has some serious technical issues which make it unplayable for some people the minmum cpu requirement is i3 but it cannot even run well on i7 its unable to work properly on i5 and it will max out the cpu and memory useage somehow moreover it stutters like hell on many high and mid end rigs including minei76700kgtx9708gb ram this is really unacceptable its unplayable for me at the moment due to the severe stuttering so i wont change my negative review unless treyarch fix these issues i also suggest anyone who wants to buy this game just wait until devs fix these issues edit1 the day1 patch didnt fix my problem and the game still overuses the memory resource so still negative,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,bo3 is a game that needs your attention they are trying to show you how pc ports of cod arent all bad and that theyre trying to work on it treyarch really does try and make good ports of cod all leading up to bo3 in my book have been well made ports with bo3 treyarch is really stretching it theyre trying to make a new staple in pc cods with additions such as 2 player splitscreen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year this alone shows how serious they are with pc ports along side this we have full dedicated servers an fov slider that goes up to 120 a reasonable options menu changable frame rates and much more they are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly i havent met a single hacker in any gamemode as of writing this review bo3 didnt have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware i didnt have any major problems during the launch but after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up compaired to the launch as of writing this i have no farther complaints to say about bo3 performance wise now lets stop talking about the pc port and start talking about bo3 as a whole bo3 adds many new features to the cod formula such as specalists and a more fluid movement system a specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities these abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time this changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play the new movement system isnt something to go to much in detail in they mainly added wall running and sliding this makes the game more fast paced and fun to play tldr pros split screen specalists alot of features for a pc port new movement system cons some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware this isnt as bad as before though overall 8510 remember this review is based on the enjoyment i have had with the game this is all just my opinion,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,the servers are terrible one guy with a 300 ping joins and everyone else suffers with enormous lag the devs havent even tried to fix it 1010 would refund update the ping issue is somewhat fixed i guess but the level based matchmaking is really fked up a level 1 player went against a max prestige lvl 1000 yeah,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,the campaign is a chaotic mess the main characters are uninteresting i even forget all their names i didnt get any sentimental conection to my own main character or my team buddies when doing the missions i have no clue why im even doing it you get trown around making you confused as heck it felt uninspiring and very boring if your buying this for solely multiplayer then your set its solid but nothing realy inovative there alot of fps games out there even older ones that provide even more modes and even vehicles i havnt tried zombies yet i havent encounter any mayor bugs or hiccups like most people it runs fine on my pc however the character blend to much with the enviroment making it realy hard to spot people but as it stands now i wouldnt recommend this game,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,review of the singleplayer campaign not interested in multiplayer i have to say i am honestly surprised in a good way the black ops 3 campaign is way longer than what we are used to in this franchise i think it took me about 12 hours which is a good length for a shooter even by normal standards but especially compared to other call of duty games the story was pretty boring in the beginning but it got better and better to the point where i was honestly interested in how it all would play out the acting was pretty good real actors digitalized and the ending well the ending was great it left me sitting in front of my monitor and wondering what the hell just happened i ended up reading explanations and theories about the story for another 20 minutes it is a surprisingly complex story for this kind of action game not quite on the same level as bioshock infinite or to the moon but way above your usual cod story i have to say i really liked it despite the boring start the gameplay is cod standard nothing special here you have some abilities to unlock and upgrade but i rarely used them you have a wallrun but only a few opportunities to use it in the levels it felt unnecessary and that was a shame because its a cool mechanic and should have been integrated better in the level design most of your enemies are the typical noname soldiers there are also certain types of mechs some are soldierlike and a few bigger ones which require the use of a rocket launcher so there is some variety here but in the end it is typical cod shooter gameplay which is not brilliant but alright the graphics are ok the game looks quite good sometimes but overall dated they really make the most out of the old engine but the game cannot compete with modern titles like battlefront or witcher 3 if you want a number i guess i would give it a 7510 for the campaign and it could have been more had they improved the gameplay a little more i really didnt think it would be that good,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,still wont fuing work,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,this game was made for console and with their actions treyarch makes it very clear that they dont care about pc players unless you buy it for zombies or graphics this is a complete waste of money,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,i wanted to take the time and explain all of the content on the game so buyers can make an informed purchase as many know since there are 3 different makers of the game the gameplay and content can change drastically between them this game is made by treyarc if you do not follow them they are the original creators of zombies and often regarded as the best of the three now for the review campaign the campaign allows for 4 different difficulties ranging from beginner to holy sh the game allows for multiplayer campaign which is a huge plus and a lacking feature from the years previous which i really enjoy the graphics are what you would expect from such a large franchise so i wont go into detail there in the game you are outfitted with a chip in your brain which allows you to interpret various things very quickly and also give you advantages such as hacking robots and or causing them to self destruct the overall gameplay is not the best seen in the years of call of duty but it is well made smooth frame rates provide a really good experience overall the game doesnt allow you to skip cut scenes and many are pretty long i particularly like following the story however this could get old for some one the campaign is complete it opens a new mode which is a zombie story mode i personally am really excited about this however due to the long story mode and attempting it on realistic i have not made it that far yet i will update my review when i reach that area of the game edit the cut scenes are in fact skipable and when playing a mission on realistic it is best to play with friends even when with friends a single mission will take on the order of 12 hours depending on the mission the zombie story mode is a lot of fun and depending on the difficulty you select can be very very challenging at the beginning of a level there will be a mystery box its actually very well done in how they incorporate random things that have become a staple in the zombie mode i was anxious to reach the zombie story mode but was a bit reserved in thinking it might not be laid out very well it is in fact is even more fun than the main story line in my opinion i wont include any spoilers for those who havent played either story line but the game play is amazing multiplayer the multiplayer is standard call of duty but has the addition of a super power and wall running i particularly dont care for the wall running or double jump and all that fancy stuff but if it must be added to the game then it is much better than the exo suit from last years call of duty the map designs are really nice for multiplayer and the overall game play feels very balanced depending on play style edit i have actually come to enjoy the wall running mechanics unlike previously stated it takes some getting use to but once you jump on a wall to begin wall running go ahead and aim down the sights and its a good method the sneak over to a player and get the kill before he realizes where you are the super powers that you can select from are a very nice touch while some are way more useful than others i personally prefer the annihilator its a one shot one kill pistol and if you are an accurate shot then this is a must try it is very effective and impossible to defend if you are accurate miss a shot however and the very slow reload will most likely render you dead zombies disclaimeri love zombies the first and only map of black ops 3 is amazing its a huge map with many things to explore in place of dogs however there are these bat like creatures that come every 5 rounds or so also as you increase in rounds a octopus like boss arrives and will chase you he really isnt a big dealeasy to kill but more and more of these boss like creatures will begin to spawn each round there are a few new additions such as gum balls and a new perk i wont explain every detail but if you are a fan of zombies then you will enjoy the new map make sure to google how to find the perks as there are busted bottles that will explain the best direction to travel towards to get the desired perk in order to turn on power etc you will need to become the beast which is ok i guess its new and different but not sure how i feel about it yet i will say this though its much better than the bus map that black ops 2 came with good luck easter egg hunting i will add that if you are playing with a group of 4 i have found a very good strategy that will allow you to reach the higher rounds and each have their own circle once you open pack a punch room one player stays in there while another is just outside pack a punch while remaining in the rift as long as you have opened all the rifts the other 2 players can simultaneously run the boxing ring circle this will allow one to face forward and clear the path while the other is opening fire to clear the zombies chasing you ok so thats a quick rundown of the changes and what to expect please do not downvote cause you are a fanboy or hate the game and do not agree with what i said i am attempting to inform buyers of the changes and what to expect although some is my opinion of course i tried to give an honest review with no bias update 031016 so i have had a lot of time playing the game now and have unlocked everything that you can basically for the price of the game you are getting 2 full length story modes normal and zombie the standard call of duty multiplayer with the addition of powers and wall running and a massive zombie map that offers a ton of replayablility honestly treyarc killed it with this game although its not perfect since there are still glitches such as the game randomly freezing causing you to start a 2 hour mission over as well as a few other annoyances i highly highly recommend this game to those that are on the fence imo this is the best multiplayer experience to come from the call of duty franchise in a long time,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,the gameplay is fun enough but i put the game aside once they introduced unique weapons into the black market the game is already a full priced triple a title with a season pass there is no need to try to milk players with micro transactions,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,stephen hawking runs better than this game,-1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,this game is loking really good with the very neat and fun mechanics butit seems like you really do need a powerful pc for this game i can run a lot of games at 60fps but i can only run this at 26fpsnot really something i can handle,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,although it does support up to 120 fov and has loads of graphics options optimization is horrible doesnt support 219 resolutions and stutters on a gtx 980 technical issues aside there is more content than ever coop campaign freerun parkour training simulator zombie mode nightmare mode realistic difficulty dead ops arcade and more,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,after 175 hours im sad to tell that i cant recommend this game poor optimization lag and the fact that except tdm and dom nothing else is played doesnt help free run or parkour you can do on 10 of the maps so they are practicaly useless and then the main feature is double jump weapon balance is non existent i will quote my friend who told me that treyarch used logic that if nothing is balanced then everything is balanced and the list goes on i recently played bo2 much better game and i would advise all of you to try that and pass this thing5510,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,my thought about this game campaign mode utterly tasteless playing alone playing with others doesnt help much since the story is airthin frame rates drops frequently random disconnection good luck find anyone to play with in public game nightmare mode a god of war rip off plotwise you are aided by a female demigod to kill her demigodbrother sounds familiar 3 may be this is how they compensate the blend main story they add zombies and a lots of dialogs between your character and two other voices zombie mode ohh its colorful but there arent many things that can make you feeling wow this is brand new random disconnection crashes need less luck to find someone to play with multiplayer mode random disconnection crashes familiar game play good chances to find a game in certain game modes so all in all not recommended but if you are not short on money go right ahead get a taste of how far cod has fallen,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,i swear they pay people to write a positive comment about this game and pay more people to up vote and pay yet more people to down vote all the negative ones but trust me this review is worth a read ive played a few call of duty games in my time and it seems to get worse with each one since modern warfare 2 with black ops 1 being the last good call of duty but when you play this youll want to play one of the older call of duties where the people are actually on the ground it is no longer realistic but theyve moved to the theme of being futuristic which doesnt give the same appeal i want to like this game and i dont want to the bad reputation of a call of duty doesnt want me to like this game but because my friends play it i want to like it so that i can play with them no matter how hard i try i cannot recommend this game my friends like it for the nostalgia that i simply dont have with this game they would buy the game just for the zombies where i see the main aspect of the game being at multiplayer so why would you get this game if call of duty is the same game over and over again if youre buying it for the zombies get black ops 1 and the dlc if youre that committed as always it is also a bad pc port your pc can be 2x more powerful than one of the consoles yet youll equal its performance of course the performance is getting better with each update but still after downloading 24gb of the game surely there would be performance problems already solved in that data somewhere i have only watched the campaign on youtube the campaign it washed up and could have been thought up by someone who has only played 1 call of duty and it also seems they wrote the campaign on the back of a napkin with a crayon the dedicated servers seem to be more dedicated to the consoles its as if they want the pc users to suffer they try to shove more dlc down your throat as you only get 1 map on zombies multiplayer maps are very small so you arent bored yet the maps are boring as they are not adapted to the movement mechanics of the game there are also a lot of balance issues with weapons if you play the game youll find out what is op soon enough if you dont want to be disappointed even more dont play the campaign you wont care or remember anymany characters the voice acting on them is poor and if you want to play it multiplayer it sucks even further as it obviously wasnt configured for multiplayer campaign this game is definitely not with its major price tag if you want a call of duty buy a cheaper one if you really want this game but it from an external website like co m or cdkeys if you want a shooter game counterstrike global offensive will be a lot better for you but it might take some time getting used to what i like about this game at least it still has guns in it at least most of the weapons are clicking the uninstall button,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,the game is still in beta possibly even early alpha do not buy do not waste your bandwidth hard drive space money or time this game is worse than the last worst game youve played trust me you do not want to play this pile of disappointing glitching garbage of a game youd rather play emulated snes games i know i do dont take my word for it though just read the forums good luck and ripblops3,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,waste of money 1 getting this shtty game refunded 2 buy fallout 4 edited both game garbage,-1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,same different smell black ops iii does nothing to improve the series formula it adds nothing new to the shooting genre or gaming in general it has a somewhat solid campaign but the storyline is muddled and the players abilities arent implemented all that well expect to finish it in 6 or 7 hours and dont expect it to leave any kind of impact on you if youre going to sink 50 hours into the multiplayer and have a bunch of friends to play with then there is a bit of value here the new zombie mode seems fun too but at the time of writing this review the matchmaking is having issues and finding a game is tricky this is hardly the worst cod game ever made it does have a fair bit of content but it sure is far from the best most people will already have made their minds up about this one anyway full video review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtqczhmqqj6g,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,for those of youcwondering why this game got terrible reviewsthats because off the poor start the game had on release date lets be honest we all knew that the game wouldnt be great nor perfect appon release date but lets look past the bad stuff that you all already knoww about and think positive lets be honest this is by far the best multiplayer experience we have had since bo2 sooo much to do such as the paint shop and gun smithyou can now finally swim and not to mention the fact that you can actually see your feet this is literally the most fun ive had on a cod in ages and yes i have a great mid end pc destktop to play this on but my laptop should not be able to run this but yet it can my cpu is i5 5200u at 24ghz per core boosted to 27ghz duel so this laptop should not be able to run it if my laptop can run this game on decent settings then you should be able to run it just fine with your i7s and stuffif not ask for support overall amazing game feels great its the type off game you can pick up at any time any skill level and still have fun id recommend this simply because off the experience we are finally getting from a cod after 3 years1010 all the way,1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,i didnt know that they would release infinite warfare the way it is now that i have seen it black ops 3 is much better,1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,unable to join friends lobby their unable to join mine i cant play with the friends that i convienced to buy the game to play with well this is ed if you are not going to have dedicated servers at least document what thousands of ports you want me to open to the whole ing world to come into my network in this day in age what do i need to be concerned about you charge premium prices and put out subpar products honestly wtf,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,in its current state i would not recommend this game this game is plagued with issues right now as im sure youve heard there is frequent stutteringfps drop gameplay stutters loading screen stutters cutscene stutters everything sometimes its really weirdly timed too you can have a shootout with weather effects and explosions everywhere and the fps will be fine go into a small room and suddenly it all just drops i tweaked the setting here and there and its improved things somewhat gameplay improved cutscnes didnt its mostly a mixture of low medium with some of that resolution upscaling this game has jesus christ it made the game look real ing ugly multiplayer is as chaotic as ever whoever shoots first wins if you still dig that in these games go right the ahead if not you might wanna skip this i havent really seen examples of some of these specialist classes being more op than other classes mind you im awful at the game so im not the best person to judge the maps dont really seem that memorable just run here and shoot that less campers than other entries so thats good i guess the whole updated mobility in this game kinda seems like a cheap gimmick to me most of the time it just seems to be more effective and quick to just point and shoot like a traditional cod game than it is to run all over the walls and i would try performing jumpswall runs in some spots that look really good for those movements only to find an invisble wall blocking me and sending me to my death it doesnt seem like mobility is actually encouraged to be honest i did find one design choice very irritating the fact that the campaign is sorta likesplit into 2 clones one for sp and one for mp with progression in one mode not having an effect on the other this really bugged me because the game defaults to the online campaign i nearly lost connection to my own campaign level somehow when i went to play offline i discovered i had to start over so didnt bother with that oh yeah i cant seem to find a way to play zombies offline its not just the game which stutters it slows my whole computer down it takes a few seconds to close down when i quit out and then turns my pc into a potato for a couple minutes this has never happened to me with any other game witcher 3 mgsv fallout 4 nothing update ok the campaignunless you have friends its just boring and tedious because its built for coop enemies are just eveeeryyywheeeerrrre it makes everything crawl along at a snails pace as you try to kill dozens of enemies in a single area to progress at the end of all levels after the first your kill count will just be in the hundreds it really doesnt help with this one section section with never ending waves of respawning enemies good ing god beyond the gameplay the plot kindve falls over the concept is interesting but it often falls flat because of how it can sometimes heavily rely on the relationships between these dull boring uninteresting unexplored characters it doesnt help that some of the dialogue and voice acting is just full of cringe theres also this stupid cheap twist but i cant comment on that more without spoiling it sorry update 2 ok zombies is alright as usual its a party orientated game so the best experience is with friends the new map isinteresting it has a great look to it there there are some cool new enemies however its expansiveness is a bit of a doubleedged sword granted theres more to do but theres also too much to do if you catch my drift it takes bloody adges to get around everywhere and this can become tedious after multiple attempts on the same map however there are couple different environments within this map to spice things up theres also a new bubblegum perk system which the player can customise which is a welcome addition all in all pretty cool just bring mates especially considering the time it can take to find an online lobby sometimes so yeahgive it a couple months to be patched some more,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,unoptimized at the moment,-1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,definitely a fun game however until treyarch decides to fix the poor optimization then theres no use buying this game terrible fps drops for a game with a fast pace like this one its pretty unaccpetable for it to have fps drops on perfectly good machines once again dont buy until these problems are fixed,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,day one review,-1,1
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,yes there were some day 1 performace issues that is why there are so many negative reviews out of the gate so lets get real a patch was released and now the game runs like butter smooth 60fps the entire time dont judge a game based on kneejerk reactions to a 12 hour hickup that was resolved you can have 10 years to prep for something and when the time finally comes ya there is always that chance something could go wrong it happens especially in the game development they responded quickly and we are having fun now huzzah im not saying that it is ok to launch a broken game but the game was not entirely broken please make sure you update your graphics driver there was a new driver release for nvidia cards to help with the game and make sure you are running at reasonable settings for your rig if you are still having issues please let them know via their support channels twitter email etc is the game a perfect 1010 hell no but it is fun the last cod i enjoyed was modern warfare 2 and this is insanely fun for me multiplayer is a blast story although short was entertaining would i recommend this game absolutely,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,it was hard enough surviving alone now i just have a person raiding my fridge every day,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,update this review is severially outdated and it will not be correct sorry for this inconvience when i first got my key i got really exicted to the point where ive gotten over 400 days on a world w my friends here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends starting off once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends survival wilderness and endless survival basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is dead a counter goes down for someone to join that is alive or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets wilderness when you join the server you spawn in a random location sometimes an island if your unlucky and you need to find your group to set up camp once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where youve last died keep in mind you die again that circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying endless ah my favorite of all the gamemodes when you join the server you spawn in from a juryrigged portal and begin surviving if you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character you can respawn if you haunt one of the following meat effigy life giving amulet touch stone jury rigged portal and taletell heart if you respawn from the juryrigged portal or taletell heart you will lose around 20 max health points you can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 papyrus 2 healing salves and 1 stinger yes stingers finally have a use once you join the server depending on the size max amount of players you basically play regular dont starve if join a larger server with more people theres a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or night which can be difficult depending if pvp is on or not and since armor has now been changed to take less damage ie wood armor 80 reg ds 60 dst marble 95 reg ds 80 dst football helm 80 reg dst 60 dst characters wilson pros grows a beard cons none wilson is a character that im pretty sure everyone is going to see alot of since hes the first character and really has no downfalls even though it takes 19 days for wilson to get his homeless man beard it will protect you in winter willow pros doesnt take fire damage starts with a lighter infinte torch cons when on low sanity will cause lots of forest fires can grief other players flamable walls crops willow is a good character for surviving the winter and helping out your friends in dst but she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server she can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing lots of lag wolfgang pros gets stronger on a full stomach has more hp cons 15x the faster hunger drain at full stomach moves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach loses more sanity in night afternoon ah wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is if you have a lot of food toghether its not going to last very long amongest 6 players if you are playing as wolf gang only power up to full stomach when in need dont just waste food to be a full stomache because food will be eaten fast wendy pros has a ghost sister doesnt lose much sanity in dark cons does 25 less damage than all characters loses 50 sanity when spawning abigail in wendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game even though she doesnt hit hard she losses no sanity in the afternoon as well she can spawn her sister in after 2 4 days by killing any animal creature near the flower she will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower but the fun part is abigail does splash damage to mobs near her if you need to fight something send abigail or your friends to kill it if abilgail dies go pick her flower up if you cant find it theres a minimap icon for it wx78 pros can eat any food that is spoiled stale and take no penalty can be charged by lightning can eat gears to level up max 400 hp 200 hunger 300 sanity also gears give health hunger and sanity back if eaten cons takes damage in the rain starts with low stats 100 hp 100 hunger 100 sanity wx78 is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella if you dont get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 025 of 1 hp every 3 5 seconds if your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you wont have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 sanity but not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so dont be adventuring in the middle of the night if the radius of light is shrinking but can be benifical if you use if effectively wickerbottom pro starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked able to craft her own books starts off with 2 papyrus cons cant sleep takes more penalty for eating spoiled or stale food wickerbottom the walking science machine you can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an science machine even though you cant sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up with the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and plants spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity and yes i know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population the rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review over all this is a great game and i recommend it to any and all players edit you dont need dont starve to play this you just need a dont starve toghether key please stop adding me,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,this is my first review ever in steam i think my hours in this game express more than anything i can possible say amazing artwork animations amazing sandbox survival type of game endless fun and salt shared with friends thank you klei for making your previous master piece dont starve into multiplayer,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,as me being not a fan of single player games i decided to pick this game up with a friend so this review is mostly directed to those who also havent played the original game the art style and the humor of the game are great i love every little detail about it the dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5 we couldnt stop there though we improved and so we discovered more and more of the game even now we live in a world on day 43 and still i am learning new stuff the terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with as for the multiplayer performance we never had the server crash on us i never had a client crash it is already a very solid product when i read the word beta i was set to experience some bugs and crashes but none until now if you havent played the game go and play it update havent played this game for a while and picked it up again recently i really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features really pumped to give the a new reign part 2 update a try tonight,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,sometimes we choose games based on a variety of criteria the preferred genre sensory engagement friends recommendations we read reviews compare walkthrough videos look for replayability value curators steam sales humble bundle it all paints a rather complex picture of what we do before making our mind and sometimes games choose us i have never been a person favouring survival games i have never touched multiplayer before my approach to games is that of a narratologist i see them as stories thus i am naturally betterdisposed towards examples rich in narrative possibly less flexibility in shaping the plot but a fullyfleshed character and loving mythopoeia i do not need other people to enjoy the action of a bioware rpg or the king of first person sneakers like thief these are as wonderful on their own i received dst as a gift from my friend with no practical experience in multiplayer games i took the plunge due to her own magnificent person and on the colourful crusade against death of bees and pengulls my typical bane at the time i caught the bug going by the games name beginning to host myself with the ability to create more hostile maps through the careful use of prefab presets and lorefriendly mods then starting a group to coordinate our sessions and joining the klei forums came naturally with little to no realisation on my side and finally with a group of similarlyminded regulars in love with the written word we took our tde wilderness adventure into the game for the added challenge of survival while storytelling on the doorstep of my first anniversary of setting foot outside the familiar glowing portal i am honoured to highlight the impressive replay value of dst with plenty of detailed reviews dealing with the intricacies of the game i would rather focus on the bigger picture dst is one of the rare games growing with you you start as a rather hapless freshman in a world of wacky science grimsweet humour and dangers galore you learn the importance of bearing a light as darkness approaches remembering your fragile sanity and crafting items whose recipes are often amusingly bereft of sense whoever thought wearing a fantasy elephants trunk as a vest would be a good idea i applaud you topmost you die often in very endearing ways but you hopefully learn from your mistakes and with time find yourself successfully facing the most daunting of threats at some point you feel you have beaten the game you have at least one big camp spreading across the horizon parade in thulecite gear and fry giants with magical staves but this is the point where it is all starting you seek new ways to challenge yourself you tinker with worldgen options lets set hound mounds to lots you browse the workshop for mods where sturgeons law is as accurate as ever yet still worth the risk for the elusive 10 of gems you try out new characters new strategies new maps you come up with your own challenges beyond lights out you are prone to becoming the member of the community whose lair is the forums and secular cult the hallowed potato cup maybe you actually start gming a wilderness adventure to expand the elegantly unobtrusive plot finally you likely realise the human aspect of dont starve together in comparison to the impressive singleplayer it is more fun more engaging more threatening even to die in company which naturally is manyfaced since the people you meet on public servers are as likely to make a griefer comingout as become acquaintances game buddies friends dst while with many differences to its predecessor dont starve can be played alone with no player slots open or a password but most people yours truly included find soloing with no other transients around rather upsetting after a longer while your character may be thriving on their own but your own mind will keep processing the eerie solitude of this fascinating world disclaimer my game copy was a gift since then i have been picking dst as a goto present another friend of mine is scheduled to receive her own for christmas the bug is very virulent,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,one of the best and most unique survivals ive ever played the style and the world is like nothing you saw before beware as this is a trial and error experience expect to die a lot there is so much content in this that you can keep entertained for hundreds of hours especially if you like sandboxes the developers are incredible this game sure was carefully crafted with us the gamers in mind its nice to see people caring so much about their community 1010,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,i love this game great animation fun community awesome storyline,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together is a game i play alone i have no friends,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,i got it all the way back in beta a year or two ago its uncompromising but not as hard as youd think once you get the hang of things that being said you will die a lot especially with your friends who will at one point or another decide they have the power of a god and attack that thing you knew was dangerous they will and itll be hilarious trust me its an awesome experience worth every penny and a few more 1010,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,gtday 11 gtcamp is built gtwigfrid friend is starving gtwe need supplies so the 3 of us spread out gtwigfrid friend is running around killing spiders n being valiant gtme and willow friend walk into another spider camp like dumbasses gtimmediately nope out and start running from the ensuing swarm gtwigfrid friend comes running up like lol sup can i help u guys gthorde of spiders behind him including at least 6 spider warriors gtcommence pure terror in mumble call gt i risk death to get a screenshot puush gtwhole group survived somehow 1010 life changing experience,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,enjoyed dont starve a lot enjoyed this as well i just wish there were more people to play with,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,the developers arent getting the credit they deserve,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,i am just a new player so far too good 1110 this game pushed me to have a dedicated server and i learned how to use linux because of this game i got a server and because of this game i learned shell programming love dont starve together and love klei if you are a new player expect to play the game many hours to be really selfreliant bear grylls kinda guy if you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc expect to play it alot if you do not like playing many hours dieing countless times to learn the game and if you dont like playing survival games you should not touch to this game you can go play other genres it is a kind of trial and error game you should learn by dieing by reading articles in wikia andor watching streams seems hard at first but everything is in details there is no problem without an op solution if you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration surely having a base is cool but if you want a challenge you should know that you dont need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so if you really know what you are doing most of the mobs are one way or another hostile well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods so most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities wanna fight if you do not have any armor do not do that only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor you will be dead in mostly 34 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night good luck,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,played over 100 hours still not bored 1010,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,this is a really awesome game to play with friends there have been moments of suvival fails such as setting the entire forest on fire or provoking the wrong beefalo his poop is very valuable but the elements of this game really bring your friends together if you have a good enough connection to host sometimes the game can be really brutal but thankfully there is a very nice mutatorcustomization system for manipulation the game into what is best for you you need to have the most fun so why not make it harder make it easier make it just right get this game with some friends and enjoy surviving a tim burtonesque world together,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,decided i would host a server and play a game with my wife and a way more experienced friend of mine friend is helping the wife and i out were doing well day 89 winter is coming and my friend has prepared us very well i decide to show off to the wife and start a forest fire i die and end up a ghost i realize i can haunt people i decide im going to constantly haunt the crap out of my friend understand that the forest is still on fire and spreading widely after excessive haunting my friend dies due to gringos shenanigans im laughing so hard i start crying friend is in shock that you can die because of shenanigans and wife is left alone in a burning forest eventually dies 1010 would start forest fire die haunt friend to death and leave with for dead again,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together is an artistic charming extremely challenging at times downright brutal multiplayer survival game ultimately it is one that will mostly likely take modifications for many to find playable or at least enjoyable when they say uncompromising that is the truth this game might make you pull your hair out so be aware three of four seasons will kill you without protection giant monsters will hunt you down and destroy everything you have almost every living thing will also kill you food is scarce and will take dedication to maintain shelter is temporary and extremely precious your food will spoil your sanity will disintegrate literally you have to keep your sanity meter up your storage is limited the art style of this game is creepy in a good way reminiscent of tim burtons art style for example and is very charming the music art and how it is incorporated into the game is rather lovely due to the high difficulty of the game even small achievements like making shelter or cooking food can feel unusually rewarding i cannot say the game is bad but i will say that its possibly the most difficult survival game ive played be alert be vigilant and bring friends and you just might not starve,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together is an incredibly well polished indie sandbox survival game the game relies on player deduction and intuition there are zero tutorials or handholding you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways if you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience then this is not the game for you that being said unlike dont starve the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration when you die your world and progress doesnt generally reset since other playersmeans can easily revive you the active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason if you buy this game do not think you are entitled to knowjoin an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability or griefer first survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute the variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate cavesruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging most of the early access issues and there were a lot have been fixed generally there is at least 12 bugfix updates every week and with the free through the ages dlc being steadily implemented content updates come out every month or so on the whole i recommend this game as a good way to make some friends spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving irl and of course mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges dst offers,1,1

322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together review intro dont starve together is a online game of dont starve written in lua code developed by klei entertainment as i have spent well over 580 hours playing the game hosting dedicated servers making mods playing thoughout early access and after release i will tell you what i think of the game that ate up most of my free time pros 1 the game is stable functional and works well just like dont starve does but only online the game has a massively active fanbase and after i wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages i have been sent to help people on their server to help get mods working and to join people in there server the game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well i have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me running 2040 mods with many people on a server 2 the game is modable it runs on the same code as dont starve on lua code so if you know how to read basic code and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game i have been able to make mods for dont starve and dont starve together although i only published them privately the game is very easy to mod hell even someone as at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made crappy interesting fun and awful mods you can enjoy you could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the dont starve together workshop has 3 the game is really fun i dont need to say that when i spent over 580 hours in the game do i well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content the combat in the game i would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright cons 1 the game made me read and write code i didnt need to and i didnt want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so i could log out of my own game then rejoin it when i came back then i learned stuff like how to write ini files lua batch files and other codey words i cant remember that stuff isnt fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game if you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff 2 the game doesnt have local multiplayer its possible i even say a dont starve mod have local multiplayer so why didnt they add that into dst well i can think of why they didnt they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and thats fine it still sucks that i cant play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever warning this game is going to mess with you first you join a few games then your like oh i liked this in this game but i didnt like this in this game then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse second you will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 3080 mods you can enable or disable in your game then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast well and you will build a awesome base with other players have lots of fun but then because pvp is off and the game is public the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made you cant kick the scum fast enough and you dont just want to kick them no you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it so then you turn pvp on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies warning this game will change you do i recommend you buy this game to put it bluntly yeah its alright,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,one of my all time favourite indie games out there there are so many reason why i absolutely adore this game though here are some of em lovely art style and mechanics seriously this game is gorgeous difficulty yes you might be struggling in your first couple of runs but eventually it all feels natural handsome community the wikia for this game is a wonderfull place to learn new stuff and chill out spooky yeah this game can be really scary at times and the fact that youre voice chatting with someone makes is soo much fun skins and market support randomly generated fun this game might screw you over super hard if you give it a chance alot of fun for couple of bucks yes if you get into this game you might spend hundreds of hours playing it there is just so much to do the developers seem to be a really friendly group of people judging by the forums they are really doing a very good job on improving this masterpiece even further this game is definitely worth your and your friends money stop reading reviews and hop right in,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,i really freaking love this game a friend gave it to me a while ago as present and i never played it cause i had no idea what it was about i dont like playing games if i dont even know a little bit about it one night we played it together and i freaking love it im so obsessed with it i like that you dont actually need the single player game dont starve you can also play all alone on your own server and even offline its quite challenging its pretty hard to keep health hunger and sanity up and avoidingfighting weird creatures but its so much fun though and even more fun with friends a must buy for people who like strange things and challenging survival games i really like the style of it the sketchy grafics the cute characters the music and sound effects this game is a masterpiece and worth every cent you can do so much in this game it never gets boring,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,when i first played dont starve one thing that i kept thinking was i wish i could share this with my friends and finally i can the multiplayer experience is amazing especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat the dont starve world translates very nicely to cooperative play but since i havent tried pvp i cant comment on what thats like at all out of the three friends ive played with two ended up finding dont starve too stressful something about how theres too much to keep track on at once and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work in the games defence this was during early beta and they werent dont starve players to begin with but i think theres something to it dont starve demands that youre quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree it can get pretty hectic and theres not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts its something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options me i feel like ive found the game for the very first time all over again the stuff i loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side theres a bit lost in atmosphere because youre no longer so devastatingly alone and things are less creepy but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability today for instance i was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees a wellplanned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,a huge expansion on the single player experience i used to think dont starve was a pure single player game and i still think it is great as such but taking on challanges with your friends in this new and improved world is great fun and challenging,1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together is simply one of the best sandbox survival game i have ever played the art is very unique lets say it is creepy yet cute the survival system is incredible addicting since you need to plan ahead what to do to survive in the next season there are a lot of stuff to learn and you will die a lot at the beginning but fear not learn from your failure and do it better next time imo this game is incredible fun if you play it with friends or alone joining random servers is fun too but dont get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies doesnt matter if you are online or not the developers are very passionate shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you wont get bored easily p i highly recommend this game even without sales its worth the money,1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,survival crafting dark scary nights and a social aspect of bringing your friends along for an adventure you simply cant go wrong with a game like this the artstyle is of incredible beauty and highly stylized the soundtrack is very suitable for the games setting and the effects round everything up as for the gameplay it is not for a second shallow when you start of you are in this intense rush to get enough materials and food to survive your first night klei brought this idea of dark and fearful nights back and really did a great job at delivering this frightening experience to the survivors especially when youre only just starting the lack of knowledge and your cluelessness about what to do add a thrilling factor to the world of dont starve seasons your sanity the need for food and the want to build a home make for a very packed list of things to do in only ever so much time as the days are flying past one after another the base game is already a lot of fun but with the twist of playing with friends it is even more the reviews speak for themselves and for the price this is an incredible deal that you probably dont want to miss out on,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,very fun and addictive survival game where you can team up with your friends and try to survive in the wilderness against monsters hunger darkness and cold and keep yourself from losing your mind in the process pros there is no perfect class all classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another all depends on your playstyle what you want to go with i tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game i have seen none of those problems plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred playstyle the game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character countless hours of fun with your friends cons there seems to be no way of tracking your friends when you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location i ran around for ages joining my friends server trying to find him and his camp until i eventually died in the dark add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are the game could use a tutorial if you only just started playing your only help is checking the keybindings public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders even when the server clearly states its coop,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,so i have been playing ds not many hours since i played offline a lot and i have been playing a ton of dst this game is amazing so much content the reign of giants new reign skins everything is so great about this game this game teaches you about the value of team work to go out with a bunch of strangers that you got no idea if will work with you or that youll have to babysit them and make a camp i did a lot and died to a lot of things some cause of other people p but i met a lot of amazing people here as well this game is amazing in how much love it gets from it devs on klei gaming this game is 1010 but most importantly try to dont starve,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,day 14 myself and a few friends venture north to gather some much needed gears to grow our base with my friend playing wickerbottom recipes are a breeze and we establish a small dwelling of berry bushes crockpots and a small birdcage things seem to be going well and we spend the rest of the day gathering food one of my friends had died to an elephant so to stop his eccentric hauntings my other friend went about gathering the necessary tools to revive our fallen friend i however remain around camp tinkering with recipes and trying to raise my sanity to stable levels when i am attacked by shadows night immediately falls with my only source of light being my trusty torch i run around the wilderness trying to escape the shadows but it was for nought with my torch dwindling i do the only thing i can i set fire to a far off tree how i would soon regret that decision the fire soon spread hopping from tree to the next until finally it roasted the berry bushes melted the crockpots and turned the birdcage to ashes my friends arrive back at base to see everything is left in a smoldering pile of cinders with a lone ghost floating in shame 1010 would play again also has hats,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,9210 mother of god its now gone multiplayer brilliant game with friends dont expect much from strangers though,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,playing with 2 friends i told to my friend i found the chest frienddont try to open if you open winter will come out dont open okey meok other friend ooooh i found the chest i going to open chest opening sound friend omg you idiot we told you dont open chest you noob we started freezing starving going insane we survived 20days literally starve freeze and not sharing the food together with your friends10,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,me and my friend starved together this game is a lie 1010 will starve again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,im having a good time in dont fail to adequately maintain resources akin to food together rocking out with my crock pot out,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,dont starve together review this game is the best my rating 5 stars there is nothing wrong with this game the new update is the best caves new characters aaaarrrggghhhhh everyone who hasnt bought it should,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,overall still very fond of the game both in the gaming experience sexual or somewhere else very innovative style but personally feel that the only downside is that the world is too monotonous play to play it was only the surface and underground if that part can beach dlc into the inside of it is very good,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,starting with collecting sticks and grass and then moving on to build your base you can pretty much find anything you would expect to see in a survival game in dont starve as its very clear the main objective is not to starve you not only choose to cook what you want from the endless list of recipes but also try to survive from bunch of evil creatures make your own farm and collect your vegetables hunt down some animals and gather your meat and also create your own bee hives to gather some honey mix them all in a crock pot and voila you got yourself a delicious meal for dinner even if the graphics dont look like so the realistic ambient of the game is awesome if you get closer to the fire pit you will burn you can build a fire going through all the forest and they turn into ashes and coal if you get closer too much to the sea the items you drop will fall and disappear standing right next to a tree will cover you a little bit from the rain you know what thats not all i can tell you need to get the game and discover more actually survival in this realistic and somehow not realistic atmosphere is a lot fun surviving together with your friends is even more fun everyone takes their roles and you can build your base faster than ever if you die in this world its not the end of the world as long as anyone of your friends could stay alive but you need to pay the price for it it is harder to stay alive in this game if you have more friends a dead body in the map cause all the remaining players to lose their minds so its a lot more fun and also a lot more challenge dont just sit and play some boring games in your beautiful chair try to dont starve,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,so nice i can easily pass the day playing i buy like a two days ago and im addicted pros nice variety of biomes scenarios situations a master piece on sandbox you will play for long hours to master some aspects on the game great work klei im a new fan,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,my explanation of the game best friends at day 1 kills eachother at 15 1010 would fight my friends again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,easily my favorite survival game when your sanity goes down it really make you feel like your going insane i love how it plays with your mind,1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,tons of fun great with friends or without,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,this game is actually my spirit animal,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,remember when you first played tetris and after a while buildings started to look like tetris blocks and you were trying to fit them all together i left the house today after playing dst for 40 hours for a week its winter here and all the real life twigs are calling to me to gather them on my walk i actually heard the haunting screams of rabbits being murdered amid surfing the web for a moment i mistakenly thought it was going to get dark i am constantly hungry this is what it comes to survival instincts resonated from not wanting to do stupid sht like burn the base camp down in front of your mates will make you this way,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,first off buy the game its 13 for 2 copies at the moment im 7 hours in 2 days in real life and its been a blast creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends you explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season nights get longer and colder then warmer you evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless we havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo its crafting its mining its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun i highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear the game is smooth no bugs that i have found currently and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something recap buy it 1010 would recommend to all my friends again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,the only things scarier than starving is finding a willow near your base,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,so my former best friend gifted me this game out of the kindness of her heart and boy was i excited to get to play this game after being nearly 100 hours in this game i thought its best that i give it a review so here it is this is what a true survival game is all about this is the game that got me into this genre in the first place i will say the game had a few minior annoying problems in the vanilla version no way to find your team mates on the map if you go your own way finding resources and a little hard to find food or other stuff you may need in default settings of the map sometimes but these can be easily fixed with workshop mods so theres really nothing bad to say about this game to me this was a very refreshing and new game from the useal boom boom kill em all types of games that i useally play no zombies gore medieval stuff dragons nudity or guns just pure adventure fighting to stay alive in real life i wouldnt last 1 day in the world of dont starve togtherid miss my internet and stuffed crust pizza too much 3,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,review engita a supplement that extends the life of game multiplayer until 4 players and custom worlds which can make your survival game more easy or hard with default settings mobs will inflict much more damage and theyll have much more health in relation at the number of players in game futhermore the food consumption is directly proportional to the mouths to feed micidial element at start game when you havent an advanced base camp even if youre veteran this mode will test you therefore you dont let your guard down supplemento al gioco principale che ne allunga sicuramente la giocabilit multiplayer fino a 4 giocatori e mondi personalizzabili possono rendere pi facile o pi difficile la sopravvivenza con le impostazioni di default i mob faranno pi danno e avranno pi vita in relazione al numero di giocatori inoltre il consumo di cibo direttamente proporzionale alle bocche da sfamare elemento micidiale a inizio gioco quando manca un campo base sviluppato anche se siete veterani questa modalit vi metter a dura prova quindi non abbassate mai la guardia votevoto 8510,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,this is by far my favorite survival game the art style and game mechanics are what make it stand out to me and what make this game enjoyable and unique to me although im complete and utter crap at this game it is extremely fun with friends this game was gifted to me by a friend who got the dont starve bundle and we both have been getting a kick out of it our favorite thing to do so far is feed the oinkers and collect their poop and collect poop in general we have yet to figure out how to kill the gobbler but when we dooh boy,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,mosquitos are equally annoying as in real life 1010 for realism goty material for sure,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,gt be playing with friends gt stumble across pig village with houses angry bee hives and spider dens all mixed into one community gt morning comes to the neighborhood gt all mobs come out and kill the living out of any opposing faction gt massive bee army is winning gt they notice us gt everyone in the game is trying to escape this vietnam cartoon parody gt get surrounded by bees gt get stung to death 1010 would die a horrible death again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,even in the beta dont starve was a really good game awesome soundtrack nice art style and a good story like a singleplayer game is awesome but this is what we were waiting for multiplayer im not a big survival games fan but this one is awesome the gameplay is so nice and different an awesome multiplayer good job guys accidently reviewed,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,youll die from anything but starvation,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,you can pay money to buy a starving simulator what a time to be alive,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,i joined a server and the owner leaded me to her or his base it was in a cave and i was kind of unsure if its safe they were like relax after surviving many earthquakes and food issues i found all of us together at base my health was low for all the rocks that fell on me so i started eating light bulbs the owner asked what are you eating i replied with lightbulbs 10 seconds later i got kicked from the server because i ate lightbulbs 1010 would eat lightbulbs again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,after playing for over 500hrs i gotta say i really enjoy this game with all the content thats been put on this and more coming along with updates keeps this game experience fun but at the same time theirs plenty of cons about this game for new players joining the dont starve together community before you continue i highly suggest you play solo mode by making a new server and setting it to solo before playing online to understand some simple mechanics and getting the basics on what to do ingame or buy the originial dont starve and play that before playing dont starve together cons dont always expect a helpful hand with other players sometimes people like me or any other long time player cant babysit and take care of you and teach you the ropes of every little thing your first time or how many times you play this should be you trying new things and learning technquies yourselfor use google for resource play with friends its always fun to play with randoms but we all know that its more interesting playing with your buds while trying to fight off creatures and survive trolls are everywhere you dont think itll happen but it will it happens alot in this game so be mindful on who you trust and want to stay at your base pros fun game the replay value is so good with different ways to start up and lots of areas to explore your not alone now you can work together with your friends and experience everything that the original dont starve game had to offer with more content being added on to it its a indie game with a community thats been thriving for so long keeping this game alive and active either on the forums or ingame developers actually listen to the players in the forums you get to unlock gifts that lets you get various custom skins for some of the objects ingame which isnt in the original dont starve so yeah this game is fun and if your into survival games i reccomend buying this either on a sale or whenever dont miss out its worth at least giving it a shot if you dont enjoy it then refund and get your money back simple thanks for reading if you did amp ill see you online,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,1st time playing dont starve together 0 no tutorial 1 collect items randomly 2 read recipes until night 3 died 4 start over and collect items properly 5 found a frog 6 died 7 start over on other server as webber 8 died because pigs as you can see my gameplay time im really afraid of playing this game in weekdays this game is really fun by yourself or with friends when im playing alone 1 exploring all parts of map 2 witnesses some tentacles vs mermaids in marsh 3 trying to take some weapons and foods 4 died 5 repeat when im playing together 1 exploring some parts of map 2 find material to build a base 3 decorate the base 4 5 forgot to sleep 1010 will forgot time irl,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,very enjoyable experience overall one of the few games that i would show to people and not feel bad for doing so art style heavily influenced from burtonland developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter monster ai is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional like dark souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours game wont hold your hand when playing so discovery is half the battle that being said for someone who knows what theyre doing the game currently has little to offer and it is easy to be unkillable in less than 20 ingame days the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them through the ages content should give more endgame activities but it is not here yet as of this review the game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle it is easy to do once youve mastered the skills but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,gtplay with noob friends gtfriends dont know how to do anything useful gtdoes everything for friends they still manage to die 1010 would play dont starve instead again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,personally i love this game pros to buying this game you get to play with other people in the steam community theres a chat sometimes you need the help everyone knows new things about the game that you didnt know and you can all come together and be one awesome base cons to buying this game there is no age recommendation and some children childish children play this game and they dont talk the entire time steal your supplies and light your base on fire but thats also a reason to take mods into consideration if youre trying to run a dedicated server because you can add a mod to prevent such actions then ban them now im not saying that you have to talk in the chat but please ask for supplies they are there if you absolutely need them though or you ask its hard to play a game thats vanilla without a chest lock mod but please just ask also when you light our base on fire your lighting hours of our work on fire and burning it to the ground you should have a temp ban from the game js over all i do recommend this game and encourage everyone to give it a try happy gaming,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,day 21 i joined a public server it started winter collected some grass and twigs to survive the winter plus collecting some food for winter asked the server where is base they ignored me day 22 it started snowing i got no winter stuff it started snowing i met 2 really friendly untalkative people they told me they just joined too but they gave me some wood twigs grass and food i found a cave and went inside collecting some stuff to make science and alchemy engine day 23 made a thermal stone and felt confident to survive the winter the new comers all died except for me they all left the game except the people who lives in their base day 24 2 griefers joined i asked the people who lived in the base to pick me up then the 2 griefers lied and said he burned the base his at your base stealing your his other griefer friend supported him and said im a witness i saw him burning your base and stealing the food but then i was really far away from their base and lived in a cave solo they were convinced by the 2 griefers and votekicked me i got banned 1010 would want to meet the community again,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,so dont starve together right anyway its not just another survival game usually survival games arent my kind of jam but this one is something different since its an early access game dont expect it to be perfect dont starve together is a dark fantasy survival game with amazing playable characters enemies items soundtrack art style atmosphere story and more players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their everdraining sanity health and hunger collect resources from different biomes and creatures build and craft required resources such as food weapons and light make sure you always have a fire for nighttime each character has its own pros and cons except wilson whos a great playable character for newbies also each character is voiced by a different instrument thats what i personally love the most about the game dont starve together includes reign of giants content so there are 4 seasons and most people would think that winter is the hardest season to survive wait til summer darling winter is easy peasy comparing to summer autumn is the real chill season so give it some love too plebs i highly recommend it to peeps who enjoy survival that is both realistic and challenging at times but also mixed with creepy elements play this with your buddy if youd like to have a good time and ruin your friendship funny fact i play this game mostly alone since my buddy is an who doesnt want to play this game anymore,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,one of the best games i have played in a long time can be played over and over again anyone one who likes open world games should give this a try plus the art style is amazingly cute yet surprisingly dark,1,0
322330,Don't Starve Together,its worth the money,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,oh man keli you have out done yourself this is amazing i have been playing this when it first came out on steam although this review is late i am still playing this never gets old the updates the mods and the birds and the bees and the hounds that want to kill you,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,to maximize the joy from this game i suggest you a read some decent guides if you dont want to spend time learning the hard way b make dedicated server and get decent hardware with caves turned on youre running 2 servers at same time i5 16 gb ram and i havent encountered any fps drops c add some skillful friends from public servers whosell be able to play at same time you do playing closed survival game with few more people makes the game much more better than playing on public servers with ability to ban rollback and other console commands your game wont be ruined by trolls and other junk people being,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,its like dont starve but now you get to annoy your friends as a ghost until they revive you,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,good and nice gameplay really enjoys it they should work a bit on ping to optimize tho but liked it a lot,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,hello this is my review and thoughts for dont starve together currently in early access updated as of 942015 to be honest its currently one of the best and most complete game in early accecss here why its worth every penny,1,1
322330,Don't Starve Together,good game at first it will be difficult but with time everything will turn out with friends is very fun to play good graphics and atmosphere in general advise 10 of 10 experienced winters,1,0

344760,Reign Of Kings,spend 20 hours making kick house and expendable goods now what me and guild buddy make a small abusement park we make a box outside our house ground floor for cage fights put two cages inside double iron locked doors viewing platform walls high enough that people cant get out me and guildmate go out and shackle one person each give them an iron sword put them in cages facing each other in battle arena bring friendlies over and we place our bets tell the two people in cages that theyre fighting for their freedom release cages at the same time and watch the two slaves brutally fight for 10 minutes my guy wins for the glory of the sun winningjpg let guy our of doors tell him to run free starts running off give him wood for his trouble comes back tries to kill us shackle him again and hang him from the gallows above the battle arena his body is a permanent reminder to others not to escape and thats how my guild started an underground fight club 1110 would build again,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,dont know why there are so many negative reviews this game is a blast play on ping protected servers and there arent any hackers if you get beat its just because you dont know how to work the combat system if your base gets destroyed learn to build a better one its not that hard,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,everyone i encountered seemed to be out for blood i tried to make so many friends and they all cut me down without a word so i adapted every living thing had became a threat until i met him he was on top of a dirt mound on the beach pounding at it i cautiously approached him ready to strike but then he turned around and said hello i wasnt used to such kindness so i did the most logical thing i could think of i ran once i knew i was hidden i watched and followed him he was a small man just trying to build himself a house with a garden i stayed on him for what felt like days until i decided he had to die so i waited for night he was tending his cabbage garden when i approached him from behind something inside me told me he needed to live so i stood there club in hand frozen he turned around and just starred for a second and then said hello again in a friendly voice something changed inside me i knew i had found a friend so i followed him i helped him gather resources i protected him as he built our house i was his silent brute i kept him safe until one day he asked me to go tend the apples it was dusk i walked the path to our apple trees until i saw him i tried to duck into the brush but i wasnt quick enough he approached me and said hello i thought he was friendly i asked him to follow me but then his sadistic partner jumped out of the brush striking me with his axe i tried to fight back but they were too strong for this mere man i ran for my only ally he didnt understand as i ran down the hill to our half built house i lit my torch and jumped wildly he did the same but then he saw my pursuers he pulled out his club but we were no match for these men i was struck down first he knocked me to the ground and smashed my legs and continued to beat me as i laid in my own blood and i watched my best friend become nothing but a lifeless corpse and i knew id never see him again rip poshy a master a friend actual review i really enjoy this game it runs really well on my pc and overall is pretty fun i havent seen any hackers yet that everyone has mentioned dont get me wrong im sure they exist 710,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,600 hours already this game man i tell ya this along with only 2 games only one of the best games i have ever played and was lucky to everything about this game just works and its perfect the amount of things you can do not just pvp 1 way there are so many things to do in so many ways honestly a work of art this game is without a doubt one of the bestis games i have ever played to hell with steam reviews i played this game and i played it alot and i sure as hell wont change my opinion ever that this game is the best game i have ever played and i played a lot of games codehatch has my respect and i cant wait for their next game which i hope they are already working on 1010,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,dont play on a offical server the game full of hackers find a good community server and its a great game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,having a blast i have more then 300 hours in the game so far and still the options of the day to day life in this game is never predictable the only bad thing with the game is the hackers that can come in and want to make the experience bad for others,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,this game is a bit dead bud still its a lot of fun its getting fixed slowly but it really is im giving it 810 points i would highly recommend it edit for anyone having fps problems right click reign of kings in your library click on properites and then click on set launch options and type there winxp,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,very good but beware the following hackers angry chinese angry black chinese midgets angry black chinese midget hackers war war never changes,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,very good but beware the following hackers angry chinese angry black chinese midgets angry black chinese midget hackers war war never changes,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,on the right server this game is a pleasure i played most of my five hundred hours on moons whitelisted roleplay server and my own server there are plenty pieces available for a great medieval rp experience this survival aspect of this game is good but the rp was the core aspect that kept me coming back gt pros lt building is fun lots of potential for great architecture combat is decent and skill based when there is no lag fun rp items like jester hats whips cages etc you can let your creativity flow survival aspect is pretty solid many different style options to provide and survive gt cons lt if you play on a public server the community is pretty garbage cheaters cheaters and cheaters devs made major ui and game changes in the last few weeks of beta before fully releasing the game that had yet to be fleshed out and tested many ideas and possibilites with a lot of potential will never be added horses fur clothing etc all in all its a solid game most of the complaints stem from the garbage community which is not the developers fault find a solid server or make your own otherwise youre probably gonna have a bad time,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,i learnt how to play somewhere over the rainbow on a flute 1010 would do again,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,at the start of the game u will find alot of servers with 11 year olds running around but when u have found a good server with a good community and etc you will probobly enjoy the game as much as i do i have currently played 190 hours and i say the game is worth every penny,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,i really do like this game but unfortunatly if you have your own dedicated server be prepared to go bald with rage well at least i almost did if youre the kind of person to just join a server then great youll have lots of fununtil a server wipe is required and then youll lose everything if youre the kind of person to host your own server or rent one then great youll have lots of fun with the admin commands creating your roleplay worlduntil a server wipe is required i was hoping that when they released the game the server wipes would stopdid they i hear you ask no no they bloody well didnt,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,best flute playing simulator out there 1110 ign,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,yes this game is sort of dead but just because you cant get into a server with more than 20 people doesnt make it a bad game the pvp building community and raiding are all amazing they might not update the game but thats just leaving the old days and you wont have to get used to something different,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,i love the game and these are my reasons why you need to one find a good enough server to play on yes there are a quite a lot of hackers on offical servers that no one cares to do anything about i recomend to join a community server with good active admin and become a part of the community now on to the game itself this game has the normal 3 stage crafting such as early game mid game and of course late game i love all of these stages and usually all games that have these systems usually do well theres different base teirs which can add hours of gameplay to the game plus playing with buddies adds it that much more you can raid build castles destroy castles become a king kidnap kill the king break out of a prison and hunt why does that not sound fun most peoples response to this question is that its codeatch theyve given up on another game my answer to that is no you because yes they dont update the game with new content very often but they do update it with bug fixes and nerfs and buffs anything a normal game needs theres enough content to play for hundreds of hours and when youre done play another game and start this one again later in time,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,what a fun game this is well done very easy game to play worth buying this game update i have been playing this game for 4 months now looks great building is easy it is up to the player what server type each player wants ie pve or pvp as things stand i do not know if the developers are adding new stuff or not good fun game to play with friends in my view a map editor would be a nice thing to add,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,the funniest game of my life had so much fun and made loads of friends throughout my hours i loved this game when i bought it and my opinion of it doesnt change because it was released the game in the trailers is what i thought i was buying but there is so much fun rp in it that the trailers dont show everybody in the community is a thats what makes it so funny if u too are a like myself this is your game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,i would say as one of the people with the most hours invested into this game that it is totally worth a buy update after many months of playing and 300 hours later i still feel that this game is worth the buy it used to be plagued with hackers but it seems as if that is a thing of the past currently as i type this the game isnt working due to something going on but even then i still rank this game as one of my favorite games to play,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,i jammed berries in my mouth i kidnapped and trapped people in cages i have dragged and roped people to burn on my camp fire 1010 stars sick of hackers and losing all of your blocks to wipes are you tired of thieves crest sieging all of your blocks when you are offline because you needed to sleep fear not knights there is hope on my new reign of kings server called pve rp us 10 man server you are all welcome to join me our server holds enough room for 10 people and i will be upgrading as population increases do not let this number get you down we will be up and running in no time,1,0

344760,Reign Of Kings,im changing my review 1 graphics the graphics are pretty damn good except maybe the player graphics but very good nonetheless you get some high frames on the highest settings if your computer has a good graphics card running r9 280x so all in all if its graphics and good frames your looking for get this game 2 combat the combat is fairly straight forward its like chivalry and failry good my only problem with it is you are pretty much screwed no matter what if someone has a tier above you in terms of weaponsarmor still it is really good so if your wanting the combat get this game 3 glitchesbugshackers i have never ran into any game breaking glitches or bugs in this game nor have my friends that i know of but i have had my fair share of hackers which is never fun but you will not always have the bad luck i do so you can get this game knowing there are no bad glitches and bugs 4 servers the official servers all seem to be pretty good ones and the community servers run real nice to in terms of ping although i have died in combat a few times cause my internet although in all honesty about half the time i have died in combat because of my internet is just cause i have terrible combat prowess so all in all the servers are usually good in terms of ping and even if you have internet like me you can enjoy this game 5 multiplayer the multiplayer in this game is really good like really good thee only problem i have with it is it is force multiplayer no singleplayer and no lan with just friends honestly though it is good it does have the dayz vibe though so watch out for players you do not trust i rate this game a solid 610 in other words get this game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,very good medieval survival game with rpg elements good building mechanic raiding mechanic pvp roleplay fpslagg angry chinese hackers,1,0

344760,Reign Of Kings,personnally i loved this game despite hackerswhich are less frequent than one would think and are sometimes just funny examples of hackers i hate ing seige engines everywhere literally cant build on the map examples of hackers im fine with goes in kills hacker king then dupes his loot and gives everyone in game that loot by nocliping basically what im trying to say is that the biggest problem with this game is that the community is just a huge bag of i mean dont get me wrong you can swing your around aswell and thats what it feels like sometimes just a bunch of trying to ruin eachothers day the only way to play this game is with a friend you trust because honestly nothing is worse than haveing everything you work on being taken by a friend after about 3 full days of playing on a server that being said ive had some truly enjoyable times playing this game for example once i had full teir armor and the kings sword and i had to defend waves of little black midgetstheir guild was the black midget army which was hilarious and they stopped their onslaught after about the 10 wave of deaths they got my sword and armor tho this game can be fun and since i got it on sale it was certainly worth 10 i reccomend buying it on sale just like any other title just remember that noone should be trusted and your play experience will vastly improve and do the community a favor stop greifing newspawns thanks,1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,im looking at all the reviews right now and i am like wtf i actually really like this game and played it for a while before i got a new game it is not a bad game and is very unique in a lot of ways if you are looking for a game to play with your friends this is it you can start a clan and play together it is just the right size map that you dont feel like everyone is right next to you but it is not impossible to find your friends it is true that the archery is terrible but you dont need it you can be a complete dominator of the world if you want to or you can serve under the king the king gets good gear but it is not over powered there is even a tax system to put over the peasents but it does not aplly to your group i will not say this is the perfect game for everyone though it no only has a few errors but is more of a social game so if you dont have anyone to play with it is not the game for you i got this game with all of my friends and we had a blast i will give this game a 910 if you have people with you but a 710 by yourself,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,hello i am a new player but i have noticed some things that i feel like need fixed 1 the poor optimization 2 the lagg 3 works on combat 4 just some small issues the 2 main big ones are optimization and lagg that should really be fixed and if they are this game could be one of the best survival games please devs dont let us down,1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,if you can put up with the occasional base disappearance on some servers buy this game if you can put up with losing everything after weeks of farming resources buy this game if you can put up with animals being able to run on the ocean floor buy it or if you can put up with server lag which can kill you buy the game yes this game has its pathetic bugs that make you wanna kill someone even when the game is apparently fully released but this game can give hours of fun once you get into it if you survived rust with your mental health still intact then youll survive this game just remember trust no one escpecially the new zealanders they will steal your sheep,1,1

344760,Reign Of Kings,playing with friends on your own server is 1010 dd,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,this is a very detailed review of the game it will discuss the different functions within it crafting system there is a large crafting system in reign of kings to unlock more recipes you have to upgrade certain stations being king when your king you can set taxes for everyone to pay on the server you have access to the best sword in the game and the kings crown crest system the crest system is where you can conquer land for your guild there are 3 types of crestsleather iron and steel each one conquers larger amounts of land you can upgrade them building system the building system is very flexible you can create a variety of different structures with it the building system uses blocks but this is what makes it flexible as you can create huge structures there are 9 different block types cobblestone reinforced wood iron and stone blocks cannot be broken by melee weapons so i encourage you to use these blocks for your buildings do you want to create a small home to live in or a huge fortress the choice is yours siege to siege you need to gather lots of materials you have to craft a siegeworks before any siege weapons can be crafted siege weapons include the ballista and trebuchet capture you can capture other players with a rope or shackles the rope can be broken out of by a sharp stone and the shackles with a lockpick you can put captured players in cages or use torture devices on them overall rating 8010 other also try my reign of kings server empires rpno koskitsrulesactive staff,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,begin your journey as a naken man scavenging berries to hold off starvation and work your way up to becoming king or experience the more likely result of you being captured by armored men and whipped to death as they eat your berries in front of you,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,steps to win in reign of kings 1 make your character 2 chop some trees 3 find stone 4 find water cause youre about to die of thirst 5 find food cause youre about to die of hunger 6 successfully find food and water 7 die to a in wolfbearwerewolfperson 8 spawn at beach 9 go get more woodstoneflax 10 make a base with basic items 11 sleep 12 have your base raided in the middle of the night 13 collect more blocks to upgrade base 14 upgrade stations sleep after that 15 get raided again 16 upgrade blocks to stone no more hitting ur way inside this time 17 collect a ton of iron wood stone 18 make ur sawmillssiegeworksbellows 19 craft some badass ironsteel gear 20 get lumber then sleep 21 wake up congratulations your base has not been raided 22 repeat steps 1620 until u have only t7 base with a treb at your disposal 23 make a in castle sized base 24 kill everyone 25 become king 26 all es 27 die to a hacker 28 rage and quit for a week 29 come back on and have ur entire base gone cause u got raided by someone better you in noob 30 leave for a month and wait for wipe cause ur done with this 31 repeat steps 130 until successfully skilled at game 10010 would die to hackers again,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,best game made by medieval ages havent met any hackers such a cool game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,this is more of a role players game usual early access survival stuff building sorta like minecraft you place blocks down some cool stuff like tying people up with rope big massive catapults for destroying huge bases stuff like that its fun if your a role player pretty fun if your not could do with more stuff being added to it though lately its quitened down and its not dead but not exactly that populated either also it lags a lot on servers that have been around for some time and got a few big huge bases on and stuff its funny but also buggy swimming doesnt even work right i enjoy it every now and then so yeah i recommend,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,one of my favorite games could add more to the game though,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,a fun yet tough medieval simulation youre allowed to join either community or official servers and build up your strength armor base etc from there you can take over the lands and become king set taxes make laws 810 reccomended,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,an amazing game the quality of your experience in this game will more than likely be decided by the server you choose a starter would want to try a public non kos server overall great gamelt3 this game can also be very repetitive if youre playing it alone try to find a friend who would want to play with you chances are youll both have an amazing time more people the better,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,as many of you have come to complain about how broken or unfair this game is and i understand that this game has a long ways to come but it still lives up to everything i can hope it to be a fun game with base building that allows you to role play and connect with other players whether the interaction be hostile or not i truly enjoy this game especially when i can get a few buddies to join in hundreds of hours of unscripted fun awaits and i would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to make friends or play with them,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,yes the game used to be very fun yes the devs got kinda lazy yes the game has gone down hill but no i dont really think its the devs faults long ago people would actually rp on roleplay servers people would give fresh spawns a chance on servers allowing kos you used to be able to meet fun people and start wars the reason i think the game went down hill is the communitys fault the game itself is still very fun but the people are not i still reccomend this game hoping eventually some halfdecent people might start playing it makerokgreatagain,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,this game is amazing if you go through the bad reviews they dont know what thier talking aboutthey say things like its laggy anf glitchy it could be that thier computersucks amazing mmo highly reccomneded you just have to put some time in it,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,codehatch yet again fails another game dont buy this game remember starforge,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,amazing game bought my own server and everything,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,very good building systemfight system i enjoy this game and i hope to see future updates new things,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,when i first got in the game experience i didnt know what the was going on so i randomly chose to go towards the throne room as someone joined my quest windows update game closed pc reboot and i find myself captured by a midget that screamed and me and then ed up and i got free and killed him while teabagging him that day revenge was achieved,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,absolutely loved this game very fun however it becomes very repetative havent seen anything new for a long time besides new maps which if im honest doesnt intrest me in the slightest however i would still recommend this game to have lots of hours of enjoyment,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,dont be negativ its a survival game its suposed to be hard,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,this game was super addictive once and i couldnt get enough of it now though there has been so many hackers and glitchers its not as fun plus they have stopped doing updates but as i said this was a great game,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,i recomend this game i only got 30 hours in it and its still fun,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,when i bought this game the servers of the game were down however the servers now have no problem its pvp is fun its base building is different from many survival oriented games ive played and the multiplayer offers a wide selection of funny people to meet i had a great time playing this and reccomend it,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,not a bad game but its a resources intensive game i run it low settings 1366x768 and i get 3035 fps specs i5 5200u gtx 940m 2gb 8 gb ram its a really fun game to play with some friends if you have a decent pc and you dont care about settings than its maybe a game for you,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,this can be a very repetive game but still has some great content would suggest that you find a decent rp server to play on combat in this game is very glitchy and annouying for example a person with just a wooden spear can kill you even if youre wearing full steel armour and have steel weaponry,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,what this game needs is a proper lan option that doesnt require tons of tweaking because you will run into hackers and exploiters on any server whatsoever that means ugly framerate killing castles that look completely square and dying inside your own house in your own bed behind walls with a crest because they can do whatever they want with hacks that being said its still a smooth game that works really well in both firstperson and thirdperson woodcutting has never been so satisfying as in this game animations are decent although swimming looks terrible in thirdperson animals cant swim they can however run at full speed into water and keep running on the bottom of the sea rendering them completely safe from all harm taxes arent optional if someone has claimed the throne you will automatically pay taxes when gathering resources so theres no avoiding that i find that pretty annoying how about marking someone a criminal if they havent pressed pay taxes within 24 hours of game time and then other players would be awarded a bounty for hunting them down if the kingqueen is still in command all in all its a decent game but i was just slain by what i assume was a hacker since i died inside a house with a functioning crest and lost everything so im probably going to take a break,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,such a fun game its a shame that they have updated it and now i cannot run the game everytime i open the game ist says error 19 fatal error and then kickes me off hopefully they fix becuase this gaame is great,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,make rok great again these servers are garbage lags way to much theres connection interruption alot i got it when it was 5 if i got it for more i probably want my money back other then that its a great game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,starts up game and joins a server wakes up on a beach naked and with a wood club runs threw the forest and into a field build a tiny wood house only a few blocks wide with a fire in the middle and just enough room to crounch in walks outside in the morning sees two men being chased by armoured knights from the castle meh i say to myself and countinue my morning routine then suddenly a rope was around my foot and i get draged awayi did not have a stone shard in my butt darn i see who captured me a black midget and a tall blond dude there naked and savage like they tell me that there cannibals and they are going to eat me then they drag me away from the fields and into the forest we share some small talk on the way we make it to a crevice in the woods a while away from my home they unrope me thought being of the savage nature they have managed to fashion some fine weapons strong weapons so i dont even think about escape they then tell me that they have had a change of heart and will not eat me but on one condition i have to say how nice they are not a half bad deal i think they are not that savage or mean anyway they let me go free i tell to the angry server how nice they were to me the savages are satisfied but the the people of the castle countinue the chase i went out of the woods and back to my dwelling when i saw the armoured men there was a hoard of them they caught the savages out of the woods and i heard them in a panic there was a battle and the superiorly armoured men easily surrounded the black midget he put up a fight but was no match for them there blades that stabbed into his flesh the blond man saw his acomplise but was probably to scared to retaliate he used this time to make a run for it after they had finished off the black midget they went after him i could not see the rest they had moved far from my house but i guessed his fate was grim i did not want to become a target for the armoured men so i did not try to help them but sometimes i stay awake at night wondering what would happen if i did what if what if the castle people would have compassion for the savages what if i helped them could i have saved them and become a savage myself or have the same fate as them what if they would have eaten me and not had i change of heart what if i had never been captured what if i had never joined this server and joined the one above it or below would the savages be alive today what if what if what if well then godspeed savages godspeed friends 1010 made me rethink my life,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,soo since half of the negative reviews are people complaining like uhhh laggy as fck i got killed omfg lololol worst game ever or omg high pitched kiddyvoices everywhere let me tell you some good things if the game laggs you must have a pc since neither did i nor one of my 5 friends has encounterd any lagg except for one time rendering of castles which is absolutely normal for any survival game if the buildings get too big there arent more bugs and glitches than in any other survival game out there and considering the price its actually pretty good capturing people with a rope and dragging them allover is a lot of fun and once you got some prisons or torture devices can cause serious laughing attacks especially if you play with multiple friends which i can only recommend the block like building style is something that rarely any survival game like this has and is way cooler then building on foundations like in rust or ark imo getting fully armored and having the strongest weapons doesnt make you overpowered if you can time your attacks and block the enemys even an naked guy wielding a club can kill a fully armored knight since i cant be all positive though i better list some of the negatives playing alone really isnt much fun grab some friends there are some bugs in the game that can kill you but they almost exclusively happen when you get stuck in your buildings doors or torture device always have a bed so that you can respawn rightaway character creation is pretty scarce the hairstlyes look pretty crappy and theres only 3 beards ressources generate at specific places on the map which makes people camp on ressource spots and if you dont know where to search for the ressources it can be annoying to find theres neither a map nor a compass the map is kinda small compared to other survival games i can totally recommend this game escpecially while its on sale if you have some friends and want to play a survival game go for it dont let those negative reviews with their playtime of 40200h tell you otherwise im pretty sure some of them were written right after ragequitting because some kiddys wrecked their base,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,been playing the game solo not recommended still having alot of fun there are some things that need to be addressed with the game some stability issues and a few things that should be added such as laders or different outfits combat has a large learning curve to it but base construction is quite simple you wont see overwelmingly vasts structures like you would in say minecraft though some players do some amazing things with whats there ive been in aww of quite a few if your into midevil roleplay you would have alot of fun with it as there are a variaty of different player owned servers with a large degree of varience on play styles ranging from all out army warfare to no kos roleplay,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,me and a mate set up a base little black man comes over force him to play drums did not play good enough so we whipped him and made him go get us cotton flax then we hung him,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,me and a mate set up a base little black man comes over force him to play drums did not play good enough so we whipped him and made him go get us cotton flax then we hung him,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,fun but only with the right community rp server etc the bugs are no longer gamebreaking and are usually fixed quickly,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,good game i relly like it alot i want you guys to try this outif you like medivel,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,fun but only with the right community rp server etc the bugs are no longer gamebreaking and are usually fixed quickly,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,hacers are spread all over the official servers espacially the chinesee please do somthing about it they are ruining the servers,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,hey everyone in my opinion this game is amazing yes it has its bugs but hey the gameplay makes up for it and honestly the first time i died in a doorway or was slung 200 metres into the air by a fallen tree i just laughed my heart out this game is really fun and i recommend it to anyone who likes a survival game with a lot of possibilities to do the only downside i can think of is nothing about the game itself its all the players who doesnt want to learn the game and simply kills others for sport and get loot well i hope this helped lasse,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,a lot of bugs in this game and even hacker problems but ill be damned if i didnt have a blast every second i was playing it with my friends if you have a group of people to play with i still recommend it,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,love it i get killed and it makes me but i cant stop playing this game thx to the gods for making this game,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,such a fun game its a shame that they have updated it and now i cannot run the game everytime i open the game ist says error 19 fatal error and then kickes me off hopefully they fix becuase this gaame is great,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,awesome game me and my friend played 4 ages on it but when we came back one time our house went but its a cool game d,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,overall a good game after recent patches there is little bugs in the game of course you may abuse physics like boosting jumping on top if another jumping player in order to get over not very tall fence etc pros good community servers with very strict rules for rp loads of no rules official servers for 12 years old just to play around excellent guild clan king system where king can impose a tax possibility of overthrowing the king by uniting underdog guilds etc good medieval fights with swords shields bows crossbows etc plus good castle sedge weapons excellent crafting system etc buildings are not easily destructible like in rust so what ever youve buid will still be there next day unless you are in a war with another guild not expensive game so must have it cons takes a lot of your time as a king you will have extra responsibility to be in the server and do a good role play hence even more time spent in the game ping sensitive game ie low ping lose fights,1,1
344760,Reign Of Kings,this game is awesome,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,reign of kings is such an amazing game it might be a slow start but some server offer kits to speed things along and once you get a base built its so fun i recommend getting a few friends to play with you that way pvp and collecting resources is easier and if you have enough friends to play with you you can rule whatever server you are playing on without an issue,1,0
344760,Reign Of Kings,i got this game for me and my friend and at first it is very hard not beacause of the survival element but that the more experienced players hunt you down so makes it very hard to start off the game doesnt run particularly smoothly on my pc so i lowered the resolution and that helped fairly the concept is amazing and is very enjoyable to play if you put the hours in and get far into the game this is definitely a game to have a friend or two playing with you as it quite difficult to get the resources and fight off players on your own however you do meet people in the game that are friendly and can help you and even join your guild or join theirs the combat was an attempt to make it realistic which didnt really work so it makes it hard to kill other players pros good fun with friends ok building lots to craft hours of fun roleplay cons combat better players hunting you takes time not a solo game hackers glitches 45,1,0

344760,Reign Of Kings,starts up game and joins a server wakes up on a beach naked and with a wood club runs threw the forest and into a field build a tiny wood house only a few blocks wide with a fire in the middle and just enough room to crounch in walks outside in the morning sees two men being chased by armoured knights from the castle meh i say to myself and countinue my morning routine then suddenly a rope was around my foot and i get draged awayi did not have a stone shard in my butt darn i see who captured me a black midget and a tall blond dude there naked and savage like they tell me that there cannibals and they are going to eat me then they drag me away from the fields and into the forest we share some small talk on the way we make it to a crevice in the woods a while away from my home they unrope me thought being of the savage nature they have managed to fashion some fine weapons strong weapons so i dont even think about escape they then tell me that they have had a change of heart and will not eat me but on one condition i have to say how nice they are not a half bad deal i think they are not that savage or mean anyway they let me go free i tell to the angry server how nice they were to me the savages are satisfied but the the people of the castle countinue the chase i went out of the woods and back to my dwelling when i saw the armoured men there was a hoard of them they caught the savages out of the woods and i heard them in a panic there was a battle and the superiorly armoured men easily surrounded the black midget he put up a fight but was no match for them there blades that stabbed into his flesh the blond man saw his acomplise but was probably to scared to retaliate he used this time to make a run for it after they had finished off the black midget they went after him i could not see the rest they had moved far from my house but i guessed his fate was grim i did not want to become a target for the armoured men so i did not try to help them but sometimes i stay awake at night wondering what would happen if i did what if what if the castle people would have compassion for the savages what if i helped them could i have saved them and become a savage myself or have the same fate as them what if they would have eaten me and not had i change of heart what if i had never been captured what if i had never joined this server and joined the one above it or below would the savages be alive today what if what if what if well then godspeed savages godspeed friends 1010 made me rethink my life,1,1

34900,Bad Rats,this game the storyline involves a group of a rogue military unit who have turned on their cat superiors in the year 20xx hope rides alone as the single group of rats moves forward in a near futile attempt to usurp the catriarchy touching on heavy and mature themes such as sexism xenophobia coming of age and even existentialism the decisions you make in this game echo thoughout the games final act gameplay wise this games controls are responsive and intuitive and the multiple difficulty selections such as bad rat must die mode and the aptly titled the rats revengeance mode make this game possibly the most nonartifical difficulty challenge ever crafted by human hands the graphics look even better than deadly premonition and i thought that wasnt possible this game looks just like what kids of the late 80s thought videogames might look like in the late 2020s lastly the sound is fantastic with an ost rivaling the sonic game bioware did for the ds smooth midi guitars will comfort you throughout tense and dramatic scenes overall this game is one of the best games ive ever played my only complaint is that the games ending leaves much to be desired with a cliffhanger involving the protaganists brother being one of the cats all along being followed by an aftercredits dance scene to the catchy smash hit allstar by smash mouth 1010,1,1

34900,Bad Rats,how to play bad rats step one kill yourself,1,1
34900,Bad Rats,i was tempted to roundly deride bat rats the rats revenge among its various sins include blatant typos unclear measurement units terrible grammar and awful physics that ruin the very heart of the game itself i mean what kind of physicsbased puzzle game do you have when the physics malfunction half of the time balls flying out into an unneccessary third dimension assuming you even correctly triggered your first step with your rat set at 38 rat angular units to go after 40 rat time units but i digress the game is flawed to be sure in fact as i was churning my way through this game the livestream audience goading me on as though demons with lashes made of fire and thorns i began to see this game for what it was divine retribution after thirty maps or so when blood from my very eyes began to splatter my keyboard i truly understood why bad rats was put on this planet initially i began to lose faith as would any man i questioned many things during this trial why would god do this to me why would a god of good let a game such as bad rats ever be created and on and on i questioned i questioned gods purpose my purpose and the purpose of the tormentor who had begun to work my fingers to the very bone finally it dawned on me a game of such pure agony such pure punishment could never have been crafted by mortal hands at last i realized that the only reason god would allow such a travesty as bad rats into this world is to be an obstacle to overcome to understand that truly he exists to be sure bad rats may have been programmed by imagine4 but the developer was none other than christ jesus how else would such a perfect trial have been crafted but through the intervention of the only being that could craft the cosmos into the reality that you and i enjoy every day that is the power that was put into bad rats that is the power that has turned this game into an engine of languish i highly reccomend bad rats the rats revenge but know that you should not accept such a task lightly you may experience bad rats different from the way i did but nonetheless you will emerge from it a changed person,1,0

34900,Bad Rats,adolf hitler 20 april 1889 30 april 1945 was a german politician who was the leader of the nazi party nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei nsdap chancellor of germany from 1933 to 1945 and fhrer leader of nazi germany from 1934 to 1945 as dictator of nazi germany he initiated world war ii in europe with the invasion of poland in september 1939 and was a central figure of the holocaust hitler was born into a germanspeaking austrian family and raised near linz he moved to germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the german army in world war i he joined the german workers party the precursor of the nsdap in 1919 and became leader of the nsdap in 1921 in 1923 he attempted a coup in munich to seize power the failed coup resulted in hitlers imprisonment during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto mein kampf my struggle after his release in 1924 hitler gained popular support by attacking the treaty of versailles and promoting pangermanism antisemitism and anticommunism with charismatic oratory and nazi propaganda hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a jewish conspiracy by 1933 the nazi party was the largest elected party in the german reichstag which led to hitlers appointment as chancellor on 30 january 1933 following fresh elections won by his coalition the reichstag passed the enabling act which began the process of transforming the weimar republic into nazi germany a oneparty dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of national socialism hitler aimed to eliminate jews from germany and establish a new order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the postworld war i international order dominated by britain and france his first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the great depression the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on germany after world war i and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic germansactions which gave him significant popular support hitler sought lebensraum living space for the german people his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of world war ii in europe he directed largescale rearmament and on 1 september 1939 invaded poland resulting in british and french declarations of war on germany in june 1941 hitler ordered an invasion of the soviet union by the end of 1941 german forces and the european axis powers occupied most of europe and north africa failure to defeat the soviets and the entry of the united states into the war forced germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats in the final days of the war during the battle of berlin in 1945 hitler married his longtime lover eva braun on 30 april 1945 less than two days later the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the red army and their corpses were burned under hitlers leadership and racially motivated ideology the nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 55 million jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed untermenschen subhumans and socially undesirable hitler and the nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 193 million civilians and prisoners of war in addition 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the european theatre of world war ii the number of civilians killed during the second world war was unprecedented in warfare and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history,1,1

34900,Bad Rats,bad rats the rats revenge is an incredible machine clone where the player is given a ball and a cat to kill the player must use various kind of specially trained rats to direct a ball towards an item that will kill the cat if you like me are tired of people posting cat pictures on the internet or cat videos on youtube this game will definitely put a smile on your face take some acid in the face dumb ugly cat the game uses an innovative random physics system to be completely different from other incredible machine style puzzle games each attempt will produce a different result even if you do not change the position of your rats at all it keeps the game fresh and interesting during your journey through its 44 breathtaking levels as no attempt is exactly the same sometimes the developergiven solutions wont work either in which case you must find a solution of your own or repeat the developer solution until it works its all your choice as a player much more meaningful than the choices that mass effect 3 gave its players while the game may look 25d a sidescroller with 3d graphics do not be fooled by the screenshots the game is fully rendered in 3d including the physics the ball can and will move on the z axis usually this is not in your favor but it does a good job showcasing the 3d random physics engine lovingly crafted by the creative minds at invent4 entertainment sadly there is no level editor included in the game so people cant experiment with the engine themselves i wholeheartedly recommend this game the only bad part of the game i can think of is that it is quite short most people will finish the game in about 4 hours but the game usually goes all the way down to 040 on steam sales which is not much at all for a few hours of great catkilling time gift it to your friends too they will appreciate it,1,0

359320,Elite Dangerous,i was finally about to get my new ship i just needed to complete this one trade run and all was dandy then i realised i forgot to refuel at the next star i totally shut my engines off to try to get a clear picture of what was happening looking at my computers i found a small station about 16000ls away i wasnt sure if i could make it with the fuel i had so i just did it i was dead either way flying through space watching that fuel gauge drain is the scariest thing ive had to do in this game the thing was so close to empty that i had all but written myself off then out of nowhere another play is trying to rip me from warp this was the first time it had happened to me so naturally i succumbed to to the tear i figured at this point the fuel issue was out the window and i wouldnt have a chance getting to the station so i turn and fight but hes in an attack vessle so im getting my handed to me on a silver platter on the verge of complete acceptance of defeat i get a second wind i decide no i wont let it end like this i activate the warp drive and as its charging try to put some distance between my attacker and myself im on 6 hp at this point and take another hit down to 3 one more hit and im done the warp drive activates with a measly 3 hp i make my way to the station i had previously tried to get to the fuel i have is scaring the crap out of me the whole thing could shut down any second and at this point im not even thinking about how im going to dock on this low hp since in the past i have always damaged my ship i drop from warp thankfully in the right place i begin docking preparation and then i see someone is trolling the airlock the station quickly dispatches him but leaves a mess of debris in my way slowly i try to squeeze past it all i mage to get past most of it but then one stray unavoidable piece floats towards me and hits the canopy of the ship 1 i crap my pants a little and then continue i touch down the softest landing i have ever done and let out a massive sigh of release as repair and refuel 1010 would have heart attack again,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,this game is really quite good and there is a lot to it the games flight mechanics are simple enough that they can be easily grasped and intuitively controlled faster than with most flight games entering this game you should expect a learning curve and for part of the fun being exploring all the things you can do as you learn if youre expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the game youre going to blunder around for an hour rage quit and then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off this game is a sandbox be prepared to find your own way lets get to the game itself the general point of the game is to reach elite rank you can do this via combat trading or exploration lets talk about each of these three types of play in turn combat excellent part of this game there are a diverse range of weapons each which function differently and place different strains on your ships loadout you want to use plasma accelerators well those have major power drain so you need your ship to have a large power plant bigger shield more power shield cell banks more power planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyable and ongoing experience throughout the game as far as combat goes you can approach it as a bounty hunter going out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilots breaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market overall this is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game if nothing else youll get a solid 2030 hours out of combat progression trading this part is a bit more up in the air to a lot of people some people dont like the repetitious nature of trading in the game but it really depends on what you look for trading involves going to different stations recording what they have in high demand and what they have in high supply and linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demand and which demand what the first station has in high supply in other words basic supplydemand economics you trade the goods between stations this can be a bit dull other than when pirates are after you but it really depends what you want this is the eurotruck simulator part of the game if you want something relaxing flying between stations while listening to a podcast audiobook or watching a tv show trading is for you exploration the galaxy is big bigger than i think most of us have a grasp of many of us know well the galaxy is obviously massive but theres a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all sol that is the solar system earth is found in is a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center it takes around 2030 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in nonstop jumping from star to star to travel all around the galaxy youre talking months worth of time devoted to exploring and that doesnt even count the time it takes to scan each system and go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money why would anyone want to do this well have you ever flown up to a black hole and seen the light distort around it in an eerie terrorizing sense of dread have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole these are the types of things you see when you explore and for many the feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile if youre the first one to explore something your name is also tagged to it forever the civilized area of space only takes about 500 ly around sol with the rest up to being explored peripherals the game works very well with a mouse and keyboard with a xbox 360 controller and with most joysticks hotas or otherwise there are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controller as well as most market joysticks so you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while youre learning always online note you have a multiplayer option in which youre around other players players will try to pirate you others will bounty hunt for you etc you can set up wings groups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights or if you want to be a recluse you can play solo and avoid other players and just play with npcs or maybe you just want to play with your friend you can set up a private group all of these require a constant internet connection but it is for a reason anytime you do something in the game it shapes the political and economic landscape if you buy resonating separators from cemiess you reduce the amount of supply in cemiess which makes the price go up when this happens the game pings the global server and changes the value for everyone else in their own servers so although you are away from other players what you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyone galactic political landscape there are 3 major factions in the game the alliance federation and empire additionally there are independent factions bound to specific star systems each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems lets say you look at a system like lugh which was ruled by the federation within lugh there are many parties that are in government running for political control the federation party is in control but if players start to do missions against the party in control if they start to kill police pirate traders do things to disrupt the peace in that system it spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system they start to demand change a civil war can break out between the faction in power and the faction that is not in power and they fight players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bonds and help shape the outcome of the war depending on which side wins the system may flip in lugh the system did flip players turned out early on in mass numbers to test this trying to flip lugh from the federation into an independent star system under the crimson party this was accomplished and lugh is currently an independent star system as the federation backed down anytime you do a mission it pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party so even if you play solo you can impact global politics what this game does not do is give you a set path youll load up the game youll have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the game and then youll be dropped into a dock in star system lhs 3447 you wont get a quest prompt the game wont say hey go here and do this youll be docked at a space station and it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do you need to find your own way youll blunder around and advance on your own terms when you start out you should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work but the exploration the learning of how things work is a lot of the fun this is an open world space game and the way you experience it is something youll dictate for yourself i cant recommend this game enough the combat is really damn fun there are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience trading and exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooks or watching tv shows,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,eurotruck simulator motion sickness edition the game is perfectly controllable with keyboard and mouse just make sure to change the default setting which are useless this guide helped me a lot change the mouse x axis from roll to yaw set qe to roll leftright set wsad to updownleftright thrusters set rf to forwardreverse thrusters set your mouse wheel to control speed what i mean by this is to click in the increase throttle binding box and roll the mouse wheel up and do the same with decrease throttle and roll your mouse wheel down set speed increments to 25 youll never need more fine grain control than that i also set shiftctrl as secondary binds for these,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,mission find 2 tons of grain and bring back within 13 real time hours get paid 2400 dollars easy enough 13 hours later im somehow 1200 light years away and ive discovered 3 nebulas made a hundred thousand dollars hunting bounties found a mysterious black box that i illegally sold for 20000 dollars and stillnot a single station that sells grain conclusion there is no bread in space,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,from cynical skepticism blooms humbling immersion,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,so this game guys this game is very special there are a lot of opinions about it there are many people that play this a lot yet at the same time have a lot of complaints serious gamers that have played 1000 hours have negative reviews up some of these folks trash this game to high heaven online yet fire it up every day they do that because despite the issues they have with it they love it they love serious games they love space sims they complain about it with good reason they want it to be better the truth is this game has grand potential but is already a massive lumbering giant it has delivered on promises that no other game has even bothered to attempt the ones that have promised the features that elite already has have failed they shall not be named or are in development star citizen if youre a guy like me that has been gaming since the 80s that is passionate about games as a hobby or maybe something more you have a real life and a real job you dont post online much you dont care to involve yourself in mudslinging on the net but just want to play a great game listen check this thing out this game is the game of games i dont mean it is a collection of minigames although some would argue that when you get an attempt to pull you out of warp when you land at a base when youre collecting salvage in space when youre mining when youre scanning planets when youre scanning ship wakes when youre dogfighting when youre comparing trade prices when youre comparing ships or modules when youre managing your power distribution when youre approaching your warp destination etc except look the common criticism is that old chestnut mile wide and inch deep i seriously disagree with that do you want play a game as mal reynolds or han solo many games claim be the next han solo this game does that and it does it better than anything else on the market flying your ship feels so good everything that surrounds that adds to the experience that you are a lone and powerless privateer in space you can align with anyone you wish or no one at all you can be a legit merchant or smuggle under the radar and everything in between another criticism is the game is grindy well if you want to farm faction rep or keep incrementing your credits and play the game like youre at a casino sure it is this game is an mmo it doesnt really feel like it at first but it qualifies as one people will play it like an mmo then complain about their mmo experience any game with no definite start or end has grinding you watch the numbers go up look this game is about the experience its about the sound of your engine whirring down its about feeling the pull of the star as you pop out of hyperspace its about the reflection of that giant moon in the grit on your windshield you can play it however you want it accomodates you no matter what you decide to do it has a steep learning curve it doesnt treat you like a baby there are a lot of fantastic videos and a vibrant community that is evergrowing half the fun of this game is the discovery and the other half is the space privateer experience youre the cmdr this is a game about piloting your own ship in a vast uncaring society in an even vaster uncaring galaxy its not about doing guild accounting like eve or leveling up rpgstyle the game tries to give you an accurate toscale representation of the milky way and well it succeeds there is a galaxy map in this game you are a smart person that can at least understand how big our galaxy is but you need to look at this map you need to zoom in and out it will make you go wooooooow maybe more of a tim amp eric bbwwwaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh every time it still does for me your ship can only jump a few light years at a time sometimes to get to a destination youll have to make a few jumps do some space truckin this can get boring you dont really have to the game itself doesnt make you but you probably should at some point youre gonna be cruisin on a space highway youre gonna pop out next to a white dwarf and really need to pull up and get out of the way before you overheat andor get too close to the pull and yank you out into normal space this space truckin part of the game is par for the course when you have a galaxyscale area you can travel journeys to the center of the galaxy have been pretty welldocumented even if the collective population of players hasnt even discovered a dent of whats out there this game is full of moments you make on your own full of emergent storytelling that i have shared with friends on more than one occaision thats what makes this interesting narrowly avoiding federal scans and evading their grasp by a hair on that tough piratewrought run finding yourself dogfighting in the ice chunks of a massive ring around a gas giant in a triplestar system the game is what you make of it elite is a game that does a little of everything you could ask for in a space sim set 1300 years or so in the future its not perfect but its damn near close it will keep approaching that limit againthere has never been another game like it now i dont know if the game has more unique stars amp planets in it than what ive seen it has a lot but i dont think it has quasars pulsars etc but i havent gone very far you can land on planets most are just rocky bodies dont get me wrong the galaxy is already full of amazing destinations and vistas later on frontier will add the ability to rove around on earthlike planets venuslike etc the galaxy will constantly be added to and reworked and stuff like multicrew ships and aliens are coming alien wrecks have already been found interesting ya this is a game in living development it has seriously improved since initial release it countless ways it is not an early access title far from it frontier developments is not a twohorse studio they have a proven track record with capitol behind them and seriously passionate people they love space sims they also love roller coaster games hey planet coaster will sell if this enables them to achieve their dreams they have with elite i am all for that they have long term plans for this game and they have already delivered on their roadmap my personal criticisms that will be addressed sooner or later is sometimes you have to go to external databases on the internet to get some info i dont like leaving the game for this thats always a bad look also the bases beautiful as they are have little signs of life we are led to believe most bases are a big hub of activity but right now they still appear a bit lifeless common criticism elite is as relaxing and zenlike as it is challenging and gutwrenching the presentation is second to none this is not a game for everyone but there is a certain appeal to it that even nongamers can appreciate this is a game for discerning adults im not saying kids cant play it but its for people that know what they want and are looking for a deep experience even if they cant dump 1000 hours into a game it doesnt really lend itself to playing it all the time every day at least for me but for a good chunk of hours every so often this is the type of game that you could play for the rest of your life in small chunks it will keep getting better all the time its not even my favorite game its up there butin some ways its a little more than a game if youre willing to take the plunge its the best space experience out there,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,edit i would suggest that anyone who wants to get elite dangerous but isnt in a hurry to buy it to wait for the expansion horizons the expansion will cost 40 euros but come with the full elite dangeorus game the expansion horizons the regular game will only unlock when the expansion is released so no point in preordering unless you already have elite dangerous and want the 10 euro discount off horizon definitely dont buy this i did day 0 i buy the game at 10 pm sunday night my initial plan was to download it and just stay up all night playing it i managed to convince myself to sleep and wake up early day 1 i wake up at 330 am way too excited to play this game i launched it and thought what the how do i even spaceship a few minutes later i figured out the controls and set off exploring the solar system i was in i opened up my galaxy map and looked around and saw endless possibilites i picked a far off solar system and plotted a course each solar system was as spectacular as the previous ones i look up and realize it is getting dark 13 hours have gone by wait didnt i have class day 2 wake up at 9 am i started it up again and i had told myself that i would only play it for a couple hours 7 hours later i made my way to a station to refuel repair and get off then some random guy invited me to his wing and we started flying around collecting bounties hes explaining things i had no idea i could do and which upgrades to get for my ship i looked at my clock again and 5 hours had past day 3 now im writing this after my third day of playing i managed to stop playing long enough to do the 5 hours of homework i had put off so i could play more do you see how much time ive played in three days 72 hours i have played 454 hours ive slept 5 hours each night just so i could play more that means ive spent 73 of the last three days sitting on my playing this game the other 27 was probably spent eating and watching videos about elite dangerous if that wasnt enough i got obsessed with flight sticks so i just bought myself a hota dont buy this game you will get addicted and have way too much fun,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,elite dangerous is a game of massive scope and ambition the game consists of over 400 billion star systems to explore each consisting of various planets space stations and trade stations such an enormous game raises concerns that the universe may just be a huge empty and dull skybox with elite dangerous this is not the case and with the planned future expansions this title can only become more enriched with content as time passes so the universe is massive but what is the objective simply put whatever you want it to be elite dangerous refuses to hold your hand and push you in a direction instead you begin in a hanger with your trusty sidewinder spaceship and you simply decide what you want to do there is a tutorial for the game although this acted as more a practice scenerio to learn the buttons and adapt your control schemes opposed to a lesson on how to play the game but its an appropriate tone that is continued beyond the tutorial upon starting the game youll be seated in your sidewinder you have a few options here you can take a leap of faith set out into the universe and explore view the galaxy maps locate trade routes and set about transporting goods in return for both reputation and currency upgrade your ship into a war hungry killing mission and set out to become a pirate destroying other ships and claiming their loot for yourself this will put a bounty on your head and stolen goods will require you to sneak the cargo in through secruity to be sold on the black market set out in search for wanted criminals destroy them and collect their bounties essentially making the universe a safer place seek out asteroids and collect resources through minning you can either place these in a refinery or sell them on the market complete special missions located at bulletin boards at space stations each station contains unique missions to complete and often reward sizable rewards its an open universe free for you to do as you wish and create your own experiences no two players will have seen the same worlds nor have the same stories to tell this is very much about you making your own objectives and forging a path in this enormous playground after collecting money what can i do with it two options purchase additional ships at space stations each of which will have different stock and models available or upgrade your existing ship with new weapons cargo containers radar sensors power supplies thursters heat sinks and so on theres a great wealth of custimization here more of which will come later in future expansions what are a few of your experiences with the game within the first few hours of playing the game i immediately went into exploration mode after blasting through the universe in hyperdrive mode i was immediately pulled right in towards a gigantic sun struggling to pull away from its force my heat warnings went off the scale and my components in the ship began to melt my first ever death was the result of a small burn yeah hm how about the time when i detected a strong unidentified signal on my radar so i swopped down excited at the possibility of free cargo when i was immediately surrounding by a swarm of giant commander ships those of which demanded my cargo in exchange for letting me escape with my live and vessal at this point my only option was to stall them whilst my hyperdrive charged just as they opened fire vrooooom zap off i went flying through the galaxies perhaps this one the first time i located some illegal goods worth over 50000 jackpot all i had to do now was nurse the cargo home sneak it past secruity and sell it on the black market so as i arrived to the station turning off all my engines and allowing the heat signature to drop before coasting past the secruity just five feet from the entrance to the dock i accidently hit the turbo button and flew into the station flying to the back and into the wall yup good thing there wasnt anyone around to witness that except the fifteen or so players currently docking at the time but well just wash over that faults with the game this is just a disclaimer for those who arent aware at the moment no you cannot land on planets or walk around outside your ship at the moment both of these were announced as planned dlc back in 2013 and should be expected to arrive sometime in the near future the details for this will be full 11 scale planets with life cities mountains buggies animals and varied atmospheres for details on this you can check out their youtube channel andor website for full details on these planned features bugs problems just one from my own experience whilst playing online and flying near huge amounts of players planets or stars the frame rate does drop about 60 i can average about 80fps with my gtx 760 but occasionally is does drop down to below 40 minor issue but worth noting do you recomend the game it depends if you fully acknowledge the game is entirely designed around the principle of players developing their own experiences and objects that the game is challenging and requires a sizable amount of time to be invested then yes i would recommend it ultimately you have to make your own decisions based on reviews screenshots and videos i personally am not a huge space guru the only other spacelike game ive ever invested time into is space engineers but this game just days after playing it ended with me purchasing a joystick specifically for this game its definitely worth the money as it is and its only going to get better as more content is released pros good graphics good attention to detail huge scope and exploration value various playstyles and roles well optimized perhaps most important passionate and dedicated developers cons occasional framedrops planet landing dlc and ability to walk around freely hasnt yet been implemented additional notes i may have missed a few points out throughout this review so any questions regarding the game or the content in the review please feel free to comment in response to this review and ill respond as soon as possible,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ive heard it said that elite dangerous has no soul but im here to tell you that it does i know because i found it at first i doubted it too i mean sure from the time i climbed into my starting sidey strapped the shoulder harnesses on and flew out of that first coriolis ill admit it i was blown away by the visuals and the sound too isnt everybody it really was very magnificent but where was the game what was i supposed to do it wasnt obvious just the opposite in fact space was black as the bottom of a coal bucket and endlessly impossibly huge where were all the amazing scifi staples such as neon colored nebula that were so bright they lit the screen with their pretty colors there were no quest markers to tell me where to go no guideposts no attaboy taps on the shoulder every thirty seconds for having not died or successfully left the airlock or some other trivial activity my screen didnt start magically popping with messages and tutorials and information about such and such quests that were suddenly available i was left alone to figure out things and what became apparent pretty quickly was that i wasnt ever going to even make enough money to get to the next ship up much less be the ruler of the universe at some near point in the future i flew into the hotspots where a great deal of the games combat takes place or so i gathered at the time i engaged hostiles with my pitiful kpew kpew lasers in combat inspired more by a surrealistic take on wwi aerial combat than anything resembling hard science fiction the sideys engines roared and grumbled and when i banked to come about to keep track of an enemy it sounded and felt like the rivets in the floor panels were struggling to fly apart under the stress of the manoeuvre everything happened at point blank range still no popups telling me what to do i struggled with landing and when in stations i visited various mission bulletin boards that held a bewildering array of missions that if i happened to be qualified to accept in the first place paid peanuts and were very unclear about how to accomplish and most spoke of distances far greater than my starter ship could even reasonably be expected to jump i worked with the game struggling to learn its mechanics and features but felt little sense of progress i had fun and felt like i got my moneys worthbut after the initial amazement over the games visuals and sound wore off i slowly began to lose interest i felt like after i visited one resource extraction site i had seen them all the same for the 24 station models the world was vast but lacked personality a reason to explore its contours and borders it seemed like those who claimed the game had no soul were right after all and then on one cold boring day in december horizons released and i decided to pick it up and give the game another chance i landed on airless worlds that were as rugged as they were beautiful deploying my srv like a futuristic 4wheeler and exploring everything from mysterious downed satellites to rare and useful mineral deposits that could be used for crafting everything from ammo upgrades to jump boosts suddenly my interest was engaged and the story telling part of my brain kicked in i was han solo and my ship was my millennium falcon i smuggled slaves one step ahead of the law i ran blockades joined power play learned how to survive unwanted pvp and began to define an identity within the games universe for the first time i felt like even though i would never be the master of all i surveyed the identity of my cmdr was enough i joined a group of intergalactic hippies and followed them for over two months to the very edge of the galaxy where we stood shoulder to shoulder as brothers and sisters and gazed into the abyss the dark night between galaxies before us the blazing golden band of the galaxys core running from horizon to horizon over our shoulders many of us had ships that were so beat up from the voyage out that there was little hope of making it home as i took a moment to contemplate the game the scope and breadth of the galaxy id traversed for no better reason than to say i did it and to shake my fist in defiance at that strange black alien sky i finally realized that i had been wrong elite dangerous does have a soulbut it is cold and austere a chill wind that blows through your center when youve been pushed to the point where you feel youre made of glass and will surely break it will only reveal itself to you when the immensity of the game finally crushingly sinks into your bones oh yes elite does indeed have a soul but its not for everybody it is only for those who persevere those who adapt survive and prevail against all odds for those of you who would shake your fists at the sky and shout the devil down from the arch of time i salute you for you too are elite o7,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,even if you dont read the review read these three things,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,spent 45 minutes figuring out how to dock 1110 would furiously google again in all seriousness though this game has a bit of a learning curve not a huge one but just enough to confuse someone whos new to the game all in all this is a pretty good game however i do take issue with having to pay actual money to get some in game items like skins for your ship pros great graphics lightweight runs just fine on my laptop seriously fun multiplayer is great the world is huge it makes skryim look like your backyard the ui is fantastic you can look left or right in your cockpit to see different menus its not awkward at all and works very well surprisingly small download very well made im yet to find any bugs or glitches fantastic soundtrack the quests are interesting cons somewhat of a learning curve nothing a few minutes of searching the wiki cant handle though the quests are a little limited on the topic of quests again there are a few quests like find and kill 2 trader vessels this would normally be ok with me except for the fact that its just so damn hard to find certain classes of ships out there in the galaxy you can spend a half hour searching and still not find one its easy to get lost then again i suppose that comes with the territory if youre playing a game with a map of this magnitude verdict if you like space games then this is right up your alley for people who have little to no experience with space games like this it could be a little confusing really though this game is fantastic,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,greetings future sailors having played this game for 882 hours according to steam add to that my horizons gameplay when it was a standalone game 148 hours thats for 1 year of space faring i felt somewhat obliged to write a review first off quit steam and go to httpswwwredditcomrelitedangerous because every thumbs up review gets downvoted making steam reviews pretty worthless its not even a way to say hey i like your review here have an upvote no its more like oh you like the game well screw you then that just depresses me if youre still here seriously go to reddit ill tell some things why i spend at least 15 hours a day in this game you get a starter ship the sidewinder and 1000 credits heard some other things on the starter kit but ill discuss how things went when i started and then whatever your heart desires would advise you to go away from the starter area some folks seem to like it killing people in about 23 shots and brag about it dont ask why thats beyond me fortunately theres a player group called adles armada to defend new players is someone going to hold my hand no youre on your own or ask someone in local chat mostly you get helped out i spend some good 5 hours to have a control configuration that pleases me mostly still not all too happy about some functions after that youll spend quite some time getting a better ship missions bounty hunting trading to name a few most people do early on just dont make it a race to the biggest baddest looking ship anaconda imperial cutter federal corvette after all that time i dont even have those and tell you what the people who have a conda in the first 3 weeks they own the game can be found easily click on show negative reviews only really play for fun not for credits there still are things that need work like combat logging reducing instancing problems overall its a great game very complex a real challenge to master well grindy i dont really seem to have a problem with it make up achievable goals in your near future like right 80k credits for an adder then ill enjoy some trading with the money that comes with it ill save up to buy a decent looking bounty hunter and get out of imperial space to work on utopia lack of content euhm sure i guess but i make my own content so thats again no issue for me one of the biggest gems about this game is the community a mature one i meet more people married andor have kids than i find 12 year olds whining about whatever negative comes to mind a portion of those peoples kids have kids a community that helps others out one that inspires others through roleplay if you have questions for me please do ask safe travels sailors cmdr 0ppr3550r edit 1 grammar corrections cmdr name edit 2 changed i seem dont really have to i dont really seem to have ps for those doubting mature community youtube video ingame funeral service for commander torunbsp,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,buy no mans sky play 2 hours ask for refund buy elite dangerous thank me,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,dont buy this game if you want a deep 4xstyle game with complex mechanics or economy you want a heavy story with lots of lore you want a rich multiplayer experience do buy this game if you want to play euro truck simulator on steroids you enjoy dogfighting and collecting bountiesloot to upgrade your ship you want a space game that has great controls great audiovisuals and generally captures the feeling of spaceflight very well i bought this game fully knowing what to expect after reading the steam reviews and im addicted to it now this will probably keep me busy for a long time,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,with every update elite dangerous begins to feel more like a game cost aside horizons is crucial for the full experience please remember that frontier do not have any publishers and mainly rely on our purchases to continue developement for such an ambitious game the top negative review rambles on about how horrible of a company frontier is with such biased and misinterpreted sources and from following this games development for nearly two years i can assure you that frontier is far from such a company david braben ceo treats this game as a passion project and basing from interviews and livestreams with him speaking to the community it is clear how trully passionate he is about the future of this game david braben just like us is a huge spacesim fan as every update rolls out we the community become very excited and david braben is just as excited as we are the game is in good hands oh yeah next update has aliens ayy lmao,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,seems a lot of the negative reviews deal with people sucking at playing the game complaining about steep learning curves and such took me all of 30 minutes to get a handle on the controls mouse and keyboard remapped throttle to mouse 4 and 5 that was 30 minutes going through the tutorials and watching the videos recommended with links in the game piece of cake after that havent missed a landing or take off yet playing solo for now as i know how space sims online usually end up its quite fun tons to do an unbelievalbly large galaxy to explore youre limited only by your imagination no hand holding here,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,yes i recomend this game most people who dont recomend say that the game is boring grindy etc it can be if you make it that way ed will be how you play it there is no set story there is no handholding unless a buddy of yours is willing to do that but the game sure wont the game simply tells you heres a loaned sidewinder and 1000 credits do the rest yourself thats it all the rest is by yourself if you want to rush the biggest ship go right on ahead fair warining you will get incrediably bored incrediably fast instead have fun find something you like doing if you like the constant rush of combat try becoming a mercenary fighting for one or maybe both sides in conflict zones or by wiping the scum of pirates clean from the void we call space or perhaps become a pirate yourself maybe you will find your calling in the rather tranquill profession of mining sit back start playing some music and enjoy maybe you can find some enjoyment in trading kudos to you if you do cant stand it myself lol or try treking out into the vastness of our milky way galaxy finding planets that you can finialy and rightfuly write lol first on theres so much to do and if you get bored of one thing try something else the point is this dont play to win play to have fun find what you like and if you get bored try something else,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i want to address the reviews theres a very clear pattern here 0hrs 50hrs are negative 50200 are positive and 200 are negative i want to say i completely agree with these reviews i hated the game until i hit 30 hours and i see how there isnt enough content for 200 hours ill try to keep this as short as possible for starters this game appeals to a very small amount of people you have to be obsessed with scifi you have to be okay with grinding and you have to be okay with sitting around doing nothing for a few mins while youre traveling now that weve got that out of the way the learning curve for this game is very very steep you will be dying a lot when you begin the game and you wont really find much to do when you first start off this is why the 050hr reviews are mostly negative however watching videos and getting help from experienced people certainly helps a bunch after you start to understand how the game works and the credits start rolling in thats where the game truly shines this golden 10 hour period when things finally click is the best time in the game its where you have so many choices and so many things to do that it becomes overwhelming the 50150200hr is where youll have the most fun so to sum it all up if you love space and scifi if youre okay with a bit of a grind and if youre okay with nothing happening for a while as you travel youll love this game its essentially a walking simulator in space with lots of combat trading exploration and politics if youre not looking for anything thatll last you too too long maybe 100200 hours definitley pick this game up asap updates are still rolling in see you in space pilots edit 250 hours and im finally tired of this game take from that what you will,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,buy it give the learning curve a chance and you will have one of the coolest space sims ever for mouse and keyboard users change the mouse x axis from roll to yaw set qe to roll leftright set wsad to updownleftright thrusters set rf to forwardreverse thrusters set your mouse wheel to control speed what i mean by this is to click in the increase throttle binding box and roll the mouse wheel up and do the same with decrease throttle and roll your mouse wheel down set speed increments to 25 this helped me a lot,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i had no idea this game existed until i saw it in my recommended list on steam i watched some gameplay videos and thought it looked amazing so i bought it and i absolutely adore it easily one of the top 3 pc games released this year in my opinion along with pillars of eternity and gta v the mmo tag is a little misleading its not really an mmo there are three modes of play solo where the world is populated by ais open where the world is populated by ais and other players and private where you and specific friends play together the game itself is mindbogglingly enormous with 400 billion star systems if you wanted to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other it would literally take you days or even weeks im not sure ive never tried its a sandbox theres no story you simply do whatever you want to do be it exploring the vast amount of solar systems and finding cool stuff like giant or tiny stars black holes interesting sequences of planets and so on or trading which is mind numbingly boring as in any game but makes a hell of a lot of money bounty hunting which is a lot of fun and will net you a respectable amount of cash or being a dirty pirate and criminal frontier will be adding all kinds of new features to the game in the future such as the ability to land on planets walk in stations more ships and i even hear theyll be adding alien races if youre the kind of gamer that enjoys games that dont hold your hand and require to put a little work in before you start getting something back out and if you enjoy flight sims especially space sims then id say this is a game for you if youre from the spoiled brat call of duty generation and anything more complicated than pointing your gun with the mouse and clicking the left mouse button to fire is too much information for your brain to process then i wouldnt recommend it at all it can be quite complicated at times and ive put around 50 hours in to it so far and i still make mistakes and learn new stuff every day,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,its elite what else is there to say the sequel to david brabens seminal space sim classic is finally here and its fantastic having been an early alpha backer with several dozen hours of flight time logged i thought id give my two cents for those considering buying after years decades of waiting the day that fans never thought theyd see has finally arrived we have a new elite game that lives up to the promise of the 1984 original but with all the added graphics and gameplay that modern technology affords us elite dangerous successfully recaptures the spirit of the 1984 original while adding the enhancements of the pantheon of great space sims both big and small that have been released in recent years from big names like wing commander privateer and the x series and recent indie games like paragon and rodina so what is there to game strapped into a shiny new ship the player is thrust into a truly massive procedural galaxy able to hunt mine and explore facing off against or working with both other players and the ai striving to upgrade their ship with awesome new weapons or buy their way into more powerful craft all in all its an enthralling experience and the meat of the game from the beautful graphics and wonderful sound effects and music to the silky smooth handling and personality of the ships and weapons comes together beautifully there are still kinks to be worked out of course some areas of the gameplay seem like they still need to be fleshed out and there are of course still bugs but the devs seem to be doing a bangup job of fixing the old girl up and i have faith in their ability to continue to do so tldr awesome game yn hell yes,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,httpsdiscordggkzpqydn this is by far the best game ever it has helped me tremendously through depression and i would say it did give me a reason not to give up on life since this community is by far the nicest ever from sdc members who griefe the game to the new folks in sidewinders you will see everything from a whole recreation of the galaxy to planetary bases this game does it all the support team is by far the best ever and i cant thank you guys enough for saving my ship so many times due to some very unlucky glitches their response is as said under 72 hours and they are so nice i have met so many cmdrs in space and on discord and none each one of them has their own playstyle it is by far the best example of what the futur awaits us this is more than a game to me in my case this game has saved me from suicide and i dont know alot of games that can achieve this thanks to everyone involved in the community if everyone could have a bite of what i have experienced in this game there would be no wars so if you see this review hope in you can do so many things i have played so much and i still dont see me stopping anytime soon sometimes when i travel around the galaxy for days i mix while flying because why not this is truly a masterpiece and the best part is its probably never going to be done since the devs are like the players we always need more tdlr this game is quality and huge quantity 1010 1 point for saving my life and making me go through my severe depression so overall 1110 the posting is real on here for all those not aware i have a medical bill stop being posters and stop starting i was just here to say that this game helped me and still is thats it to anyone that wants to join my discord all types of people are accepted including posters s s s morons idiots terrorists rapists pot heads bullies and of course to finish it off neo nazies polite people are prohibited and furries will be purged and burnt alive if you see my remains dont ask then i fit in porn of course is the only subject we talk about between cmdrs and man do we ing love that maybe porn could help with my depression dont you think well anyway enough of that sarcasm and have a nice day cmdrs o7 see you guys in space httpsdiscordggkzpqydn,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if you were disappointed that x rebirth was buggy as sht and star citizen is too far off in the distant future this makes for an excellent alternative,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,this is amazing dont be discouraged by the learning curve its a game that respects its players once you learn a bit of the game you will be amazed by this superb universe definitely buy sure if youre looking for eve online youll be dissapointed cant group up yet in an mmo sense of things healer tank etc you can trade explore fight thats about it its a vast universe with lots of systems to explore lots of quests from delivering cargo to fighting pirates or attacking traders you can play it solo or online with other players the game looks stunning definitely the best space sim ive ever played some players are complaining about grinding well i guess we all got a bit too used to wow or such other mmos lets run through a few instances then a few raids gear up in 2 days yay content exhausted here you must upgrade your ships or buy new ones and it takes time if youre new to this game and dont know how to make credits thats your grinding i stick to my saying if youre into space sims buy this game you wont regret it,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,this is the first time i am writing a game review mainly because i thought some of the reviews that dont recommend the game are a little misleading i think the game is fantastic great graphics and there is a good amount of stuff to do i love the fact that the flying is very hands on and complicated you definitely want to watch some of the tutorials that are out there to help you get a grip on learning the game initially it took me loads of time to dock my ship but i am getting better and am cutting that down to 5 minutes love it there are some things that i find could use improvement the trade tab is a little confusing and its not easy to keep track of what to buy and sell where and when i am not happy with the systems map it shows you whats there but it doest let you highlight any spot in the system and plug that spot into your navigational system to go there that could be improved it would help if there were an ingame encyclopedia like the one in total war for example in order to look up what certain things meanare good for etc overall i am really looking forward to playing this game and if you enjoyed wing commander freelancer or any other game of that type youll enjoy this too,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ill be sharing my humorous mishaps and other encounters in my review smuggled 10 tons of space weedon accident was smuggling cargo into a station and then i got scanned out of panic i floored my engine to try to scramble into the station got fined for the cargo anyways missed slammed into the side of the station and received another fine got stuck in the airlock of a station by flying sideways got blown up by the station of course and fined was busy in the steam overlay wasnt looking and smashed headfirst into an outpost going about 350 ms in eravate a sidewinder newbie decided to shoot at me near the station so for and giggles i boosted into him in my vulture launched him into oblivion and he proceeded to blow up received a 200 cr fine for reckless piloting but i got a 600 cr bounty for his destruction worth it o this game is very fun to sum it up,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,serious review at the end,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,hello to all you future elite pilots i bought this game after playing the original elite on commodore 64 and i could not stop playing it back in the late 70s or 80s when this game was advertised for steam i had it in my wishlist and became so impressed with the video footage i knew this would be a game worth having being that i am a loyal elite fan this game has good graphics and sound on a average computer and my computer is a high end computer soi have everything set on ultra in the game settings and it runs very smoothly the sound is good on headphones but it is advised you play this game using a 360 gamepad or joystick being a space simulation there is many things you can do in this game depending on what you want to do such as bounty hunting or trading from planet to planet or discover new planets in billions of systems as in elite the space is endless and for those who like to kill and kill more then this game is for you as in space nobody can hear anyone scream this game can be hard to start with as it has a big learning curve but for those who has never played the original before it can take a little while to get the hang of it but given a little time and patience and a lot of trading and bounty hunting you will get the hang of it in no time and become one of the deadliest elite pilots and feared by everyone there is training videos that comes with this game to help you fully understand the game better advice i started out mostly trading to begin with as fighting in a basic sidewinder with no upgrades is a sure way to die quickly so avoid fighting until you get a better ship you need to trade well to get the credits to buy a better ship and upgrade it with a4 parts i bought the cobra mk iii and fitted it out with the best of everything this will take some time but it is worth it in the end as it is a all round ship good for fighting and trading until you have enough credits to buy a asp or lokon t7 trade ship which has a big cargo hold which means earning big money to end up buying a python or anaconda and fully fit it out with a python i can visit all these star systems with no fear of having my ship smashed to atoms among the stars by any smart fly by night elite bounty hunter pilots i advise all new pilots to start off playing in solo mode and not multiplayer mode as if you play in multiplayer mode in the beginning you will be hunted down by more advanced players in elite until you have a better fighter ship and gained some playing time everything you do and achieve in solo mode wont be lost as it can be used in multiplayer mode so build your ship up in solo then go into multiplayer with that ship then you will have a better chance of survival there is just one golden rule to remember be patient never rush it rome was not built in a day everything will turn out ok if you play this game right and always remember to keep enough credits back in reserve in case you get your butt kicked and have to replace your ship or sadly it will be back to the beginning with a sidewinder this is a game that is endless and will take months or even years to complete i have played nearly 1100 hours and i have only just about scratched the surface it is the game i like most as it has challenges and good missions to complete the game comes with excellent advice on how to play it with videos for the newbie and it does take a lot of hard work to move up the ranks this game is one of my top 3 games and i will play this game forever if you like space simulations with tradingbounty hunting then this game is for you without any doubt as you wont get tired of it as there is so much to do there is improvements and extras being added to this game and more is still being developed as we speak the downside to this game is that you have to buy the paint jobs for your ship with real money from the developers site and they are not cheap so my advice is choose your paint job wisely i cant wait until there is dlc packs for this game and more gimballed weapons for your ships but i enjoy this game and i think it is money well spent and i am sure you will feel the same too so dont hang about buy it now and join the rest of us and become a pro elite pilot in elite dangeroushappy hunting,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,updated on april 6th 2015 introduction,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,a mixed bag of epic proportions,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i am rewriting this review because my other one was kind of all over the place and i wasnt quite satisfied with it unlike my previous one i will use subcatagories this time to keep everything in check with that said lets get roiiiight into the reviewwwwwww now i came across this game after i was extremely infuriated with no mans sky and i bought the pc version when it came out so for those of you who bought it too you know the struggle of not being able to run a game that has half decent graphics with a gtx 820 graphics card the content in the game wasnt even worthwhile either btw i was craving a space sim and then i came across this sweet little jem called elite dangerous story as of right now the games lore is well it does have lore and its there but i never really cared about it that much because it isnt a very big focus of the game however i heard it does have a farily intriguing story if you put time into researching it gameplay so you start the game out as a lone pilot who needs to make a living in the galaxy you are given a small ship called the sidewinder as your starter a couple laser cannons and nothing else in order to build your way up the ranks as a pilot as well as grab yourself a new shiny ship you need to choose how you are going to make credits credits ie the games currency you can do this a variety of ways mining smugglingtransporting pirating bounty hunting or assist a waring faction doing battle in a conflict zone the choice is completely up to you how you want to spend your time earning funds just make sure you choose the right ship for the job now lets go a bit more in depth to the gameplay elements first off i just want to get mining out of the way straightforward and simple just equip a mining laser on your ship find an astroid belt and shoot at rocks thats it but lets be real here the aspect where the gameplay truly shines is the ship combat the dogfighting in this game is truely unique and the difficulty exceeds once you start encountering different ships and trying to figure out how to deal with them the combat in elite dangerous seems simple at first point shoot destroy get a bounty voucher or get a bounty on yourself and it is early on fighting weaker enemies you may think the combat is a breeze however once you start making your way up to better ships and fighting stronger pilots you will quickly figure out the combat in this game is no simple breeze you will eventually encounter ships that will destroy you in mere seconds like pythons imperial clippers and the legendary fer de lance fighter all of which will completely smoke you if you dont know your manouvers or dont have a good enough ship this game has a very steep learning curve for ship combat and it is an absolute neccessity to learn your manouvers so you can stay in their blind spots for as long as possible and avoid being blown out of the cosmos in 5 seconds you also shouldnt be afraid to bail and warp out if you take too much damage however if the enemy is faster than you well good luck buddy you also have the ability to forward power to you different modules like your engines and weapons if you find your weapons are overheated you can forward power to them to get a quick boost same with your engines and shields also bear in mind that any damage taken will not just be to your hull and will damage other parts of your ship you power plant warp drive etc they can all be damaged so before you warp into another fight make sure you check the health on your modules to make sure youre able to warp out of a fight in case of an emergency or your thrusters dont malfunction and you are left completely imobile even your canopy can be destroyed so for god sake upgrade your emergency life support before anything else also its worth mentioning the game has a very in depth customization system allowing you to procedurally upgrade your ship with more weapons better armor and various gadgets that allow you to scan targets for extra bounties boost your shields and even one that allows you to pull ships out of warp so you can attack them graphics and smiles delightfully atmosphere for gods sake the graphics and overall feel in this game are just badass if you have read through any of the other positive reviews on this game chances are you have seen people complimenting on how awesome the atmosphere in this game is to sum up some details for you canopy breaches cause the air to be sucked out of your ship and the glass to crack all in awesome detail and causing the cockpit to go silent as if you are actually in the vaccum of space boosting causes the hull to creek and vibrate when you enter a space station you literally feel like you just entered a fricken space station there are many more suddle details i could list but i want to hurry up so i can go back to playing elite dangerous before my mom yells at me for it being a school night oh right and the graphics look good too just some more things i want to say elite dangerous is a great game one of the funnest in my steam library in fact i have had so many experiences in this game i have never experienced in any other game before and it was pretty damn awesome one experience just recently happened to me in fact btw the review is over now this is just me ranting on about how good this game is for another paragraph so i was just flying around in hyperspace looking for conflict zones to get some combat bond vouchers pay really good btw i found one and i warped in expecting to make some good money after a good ten minutes there when i warped into the zone i got a message from my computer saying capital class signature detected and at the time i was all like wtf does that mean because i never got the message before all of the sudden i saw this huge black cloud emerging when i warped in filled with some kind of blue lightning or something then this crazy huge ship began emerging from the cloud along with some of the best audiowork i have ever heard in a video game before it was loud and it was scary a federal battlecruiser just emerged from hyperspace into the battleground and it was quite the entrance it seemed to me from the size of the thing i looked on wiki its 2 kilometers long that it was some kind of boss event and i was all like hell fricken yes i joined the opposing faction managed to figure out how to defeat the thing i say defeat because you cant destroy it it just retreats back into hyperspace but its still cool and i got an insane reward for my contribution by far one of the best experiences i have had this year in fact one of my best video game experiences of all time bbbbbut its grindy who cares battlecruisers,1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,traded my way to 10k bought 3 uranium at 3300 a piece to sell 10 light years away for a good profit ploted my jump engaged the fs drive and almost jumped into a sun bailed out of the jump at the last second took mild heat damage from being so close to a sun your cargo hatch has malfunctioned when i arrived in the system to sell i relized all my precious uranium was gone i now have 100 gold and am in the middle of space nowhere and thinking of becoming a pirate so i can afford the fuel to leave 910,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,a wonderful and stunning space sim you have the options to be a bounty hunter trader smuggler or a pirate i got a little motion sickness at the beginning but when i learned how to control the ship it went away it may seem a little hard at first but when you get into it and play the tutorials its not that hard i played the tutorial for like 1 hour before i felt like knew how to do everything its a really great game i would recommend it,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i had seen that this game had been released on steam never had i heard about an elite game so i read a few reviews and they promised depth within this game that you yourself need to find i took the risk and bought this game the first 10 or so hours i spent doing low risk carrier missions i made a fair amount of money and travelled 10 different systems or so i wanted to leave though this was amazing i was like a trader in star wars moving cargo between solar systems if i dove a little into bounty hunting and stealing cargo floating in space and selling it on the black market however there was more that i wanted and i still strive for this i want my name permanantely on a planet no a solar system i want every planet to have my name on it i dreamt big the nearest nebula or just one to see how far moving along the galaxy really is i chose the pipe nebula using the money i had made from my first 1012 hours i bought a new ship a few minor upgrades and set off i traveled 500 light years to reach this nebula and my name was not on a planetsolar system yet one of the best parts about this begining journey to the pipe nebula was only 20 light years out from finally reaching the nebula i noticed its not just the same skybox placed for every single solar system i could see the pipe nebula getting larger with every jump i made towards it it was real it was there i discovered this no more than 20 minutes ago and armed with this new knowledge i jumped into the galaxy map and looked at countless other nebulae what one do i want to see where do i want to go so thinking this i decided i will return back the 500 or so light years i travelled to the center of the milky way back into the established space space stations and such and go the exact opposite way and move towards the pilleads cluster and from then on move towards the horse head nebula however im conflicted to wheather or not i would prefer to move into the elephants trunk nebula i have the entire galaxy to explore and endless stars to jump though just the fact that i can go to the center of the milky way is astonishing the fact that i can move to the opposite end of it just as awesome i spent 8 or so hours moving 500 light years and i look forward to many more with the hope that i will get my name on a planet for now im going to be a tourist then an explorer if i get bored a miner trader bounty hunter renegade dont worry i will send post cards,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,first of all please note whole of this review is only my opinion about this game,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ii cant make a dent 61 hours into this game now has me writing my first review i keep bouncing through systems completing random hush hush missions that are considered illegal and mixing in bounty hunting with my eagle a fighter class ship i love it yet no matter how far i go in our beautiful galaxy i truly go nowhere when i zoom out in the galaxy map completing tons of missions for tons of systems with tons of consequences along with choices do i stay loyal or take the extra cash my decision could inspire an economic boom for one system yet create an economic bust for another not all missions are do this for us well give you something in return either some systems are looking for donations if things are really bad there and if youre feeling generous or just want the rep you go find them what theyre looking for food meds bring it back and get no money but a heaping pile of thank you bounty hunting is awesome in my personal opinion just scan verify if wanted light em up rinse and repeat bounty hunting is especially fun with a wing group of people given the fact that at within a wing you can you voice comms and it actually sounds like voice comms thats basically all ive done for 61 hours and i know that isnt even a fraction of a fraction well im going to start playing again so chances are it wont be 61 hours anymore thank you for reading,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,so after about 500 hours of playtime i had 250 hours on horizons before it became dlc on steam i think i can make a more educated review on what i think of elite dangerous i started the game about a year ago mindlessley flying around space with no real direction to go in this notion can confuse some people as then there was not a clear objective it was just youre in space so go do something the primary directive for me or drive was to generate income and work my way up towards bigger and better ships and i believe this applies to a majority of players before the engineers update however missions were considered bland and repetitivem with the only real ways to make money being long distance smuggling or large ship trading for me i didnt know what to do and promptly left the game for nearly a year i then came back to elite dangerous about 3 months before horizons having an urge to give it a go i also had a friend with me which in my opinion made the experience much more enjoyable as you had another person to explore or bounty hunt with when planetary landing came out me and my friend were playing all day from 10am to 2am for about a month or two i think you have to simply enjoy the fun in flying to a planet gliding down to the surface deploying your srvs and then surveying the brilliant terrain laid before you flying through canyons landing in huge craters and taking hours to cross with your srv the game did a fantastic job of giving you a scope of just how big these planets are and there are millions to explore which to me was great however after months of us playing and repeating the same act of landing on planets doing the occasional planetary base mission we became quite bored with the game this is a huge defining point for a lot of players endgame this is the stage where you have a comfortable sum of money in your account you have tried every mission and done your fair amount of bounty hunting what drive is there now to continue playing the game for me and my friend there was none and we were thoroughly dissapointed in the engineers update for a number of reasons we like many others did not like the random aspect to upgrades it adds more grind to the already grindy game it didnt feel like the wait was worth it however recentley i have gone back to the engineers and i am having a much better time frontier have definitley made mission boards much better and more understandable missions preupdate seemed broken when stacking 10 missions only increased the rep of a faction by 1 i believe that the engineers update tailors well for outfitting a smaller ship as you are able to collect materials much quicker and get to places a lot faster overall ive had a brilliant time with this game and i am thoroughly nostalgic towards the first time i landed on planets or explored a nebula i really do hope frontier adds more content to planets but i think that engineers at its core is a step in the right direction for players who stop playing at end game i have been there and have done so however what kept me into the game was the brilliant feeling when exploring space and just marvelling at the brilliance of the graphics and sounds brilliant graphics upcoming dlc which will hopefully make the game a lot more rich with content huge planets with amazing terrain that you can explore for hours an extremely large and expansive game space which can occupy your entire day im glad that i discovered elite and continued playing it and thats why id give it a reccomendation to those who would give it time ps i know this review is all over the place its my first proper one kek,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i bought this game primarily to curb my anxiousness for no mans sky and so far its done a fantastic job the first thing you want to know before you buy this is that theres a huge learning curve so dont expect to login for the first time and go guns hot on the first thing you see you wont know what youre doing and you will die people who complain that this game is too hard are simply people who dont care to learn how to play it they can just stick with cod as it is more suited for them trading i think the trading system is nice its not easy to exploit and get way too much money but it is simple once you take the time to get a grasp of it on first glance is does look a little daunting looking at all the trade routes and the bright colors in your galaxy map but really its just simple economics high supply low demand and vice versa once you sit down and just read whats in front of you theres really nothing to be confused about combat getting into the combat in this game can be a little slow and you definitely want to play the tutorials and maybe even watch some videos on the web once you begin to understand how to get an advantage combining your thrusters and yaw rollpitch together then it really becomes a lot of fun i must say that winning my first battle felt like a real accomplishment immersionai okay so these two kind of go hand in hand in this game without the ai being as dynamic as it is this would simply be a boring game because the galaxy is so big you dont come across a huge amount of people that you actually interact with yeah you see them flying by in supercruise but its very unlikely that two people will end up in the same section of space unless theyve already formed a group so in order to create an immersive galaxy this game has very interactive ai for example my very first battle in space i was in supercruise which is when you use your frame drive or jump drive at lower speeds to travel inside the same solar system and all of a sudden i had a warning flashing on my sensors that there was an interdiction or something to that effect essentially a low level criminal fortunately this was my first time in a firefight outside the tutorial pulled me out of supercruise and demanded my cargo of course i was going to just give it to him so i deployed my weapons and the fight started about 34 of the way through the battle at which point i already knew i was going to win the federal police dropped in because they had noticed what was happening they done a quick scan of my ship and i assume his as well joined my side of the battle and then it was 3v1 yeah it didnt last much longer the combat requires your full attention though as you have to constantly reassess the situation and divert power between your shieldsengineweapons to keep the advantage travel of course in a game boasting a massive galaxy with 400 billion star systems you need to have a way to get around right right essentially traveling in this game is done either with your supercruise or jumping to hyperspace they both use the same button but will activate one or the other based on what youre doing so if you dont have another system targeted then you will simply jump to supercruise which will increase your speed so you can effectively travel to other space stations events and people within the system youre currently residing to travel to another star system you enter your galaxy map there are a number of ways to do this but i personally like clicking middle mouse button to go to headview and looking at the section of my cockpit where my nav interface pops up this is a very cool way to keep the game immersive even in your own ship select the star system you want to travel to and select plot course then you line up with it on your sensors and bam hyperspace very cool and you absolutely feel like an explorer out there going to all the different star systems graphics 1010 gameplay 8510 not a 9 or 10 just because there still are some confusing things that the game doesnt tell you about controls 1010 once you learn how to use them replay value 910 as far as i can tell there isnt really a main mission so the game is designed to keep you interested however it does seem that the missions might get a little repetitive after a while but dont they in every game im still meganoob level in this game but im having a lot of fun nonetheless and i havent really played with anyone in a group im sure it would be exponentially more awesome if you did,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,elite is one of my favorite games of all time ive put many many hours into it and the recent engineers update will only increase the playability for me that said i cannot recommend this game to just anyone it takes a certain type of person to enjoy elite dangerous and its a game of its own class anyone thinking about purchasing it needs to do the research before hand to make sure that this is a game that they will enjoy ive put 500 hours into this game and have never enjoyed a game as much as elite i wont describe what this game is about because anyone considering buying this game already knows what elite is or can easily look up some gameplay for anyone considering buying this game heres what you need to know this game will not hold your hand and there is no storyline there is so much content to this game and people often judge it harshly because they arent able to turn the content into something they can enjoy which is exactly why this game isnt for everyone this game is also grindy there is no way around that i enjoy the grind though i turn it into something i can enjoy and thats why i keep coming back to this game a lot of people here who leave negative reviews state that the game is ruined with the engineer update but thats hardly the case yes there are some small issues but the amount of customization now is endless the ai is also harder with the recent patch and definitely made the game a lot more difficult and for some players unplayable for me its a lot more challenging now but i can deal with it i feel confident that frontier will develop a compromise to balance the ai for all players and they have already begun taking some steps to doing so which is why i dont think this will be an issue for very long horizons is almost a must now just owning the base game will put you at a disadvantage and make the game a lot less fun that is the biggest negative i think proper design should have been implemented to allow nonhorizon players to use some features of engineers since it is crucial to achieving the best possible ship elite will have many more updates that will probably be just as controversial as engineers but undoubtedly make the game better people judge this game too harshly because the game isnt going in the direction they want it to go in you have the right to be unhappy and there are certainly changes that i am not happy with but this is just a videogame after all i really cant stress enough how important it is that you know what you are buying if you understand what elite dangerous is and isnt and you like what you see then i can absolutely recommend this game to you any game that can give me one hour of gameplay for every dollar is worth it to me and elite has well passed that this game truly is amazing you just have to be able to turn it into something that is amazing,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,you wont be able to travel the milky way galaxy for 60 for another 100000 years,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if youre bummed about no mans sky and dont want to wait for star citizen elitedangerous is your game elitedangerous has a learning curve but its a satisfying learning curve there are flaws but each patch brings bug fixes new features and fresh content the economy feels alive and both the solo modes and multiplayer are fun the universe feels massive and the gameplay challenging and fun elitedangerous is worthy of your time money and creative investment,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ed is ridiculously underrated it has evolved into something truly special with v21 and 22 soon to release now is the time to jump in if youve been on the fence or feel burned by the empty promise of no mans sky there is an unforutnately widespread perception that ed is vast but shallow its not shallow it is vast this is most likely due to the fact that many players seriously underestimate the learning curve its steep ed requires a real committment to learn or put another way you can learn the simple basics farily quickly but learning the rest of the skills procedures tactics that turn ed into a fantastic experience takes some time its not a game you can just jump into and expect to enjoy off the bat if youre willing to put in the effort to learn you will be rewarded amazing game,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ever since my parents made me watch the moon landing i have looked into the night sky and wondered when id have the chance to visit the stars now i have it elite dangerous is an amazing and beautiful sandbox to interact with yet not one to be taken lightly expect to put in much research and practice before hopping into a huge battleship the game is somewhat unforgiving especially at first but with a bit of determination a player can soon wield a fleet scattered all over the galaxy with 400 billion star systems theres a lot left to explore out there and the game is only getting better as time goes by with a 10 year development plan envisioned ill be playing elite dangerous for a long time to come,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,alright lets talk about the pros of the game good community responsible developers quickly respond and fix your problem when you encounter bugs and glitches open world good graphics for a space game especially the upcoming neutron star revamped dd not pay2win great sound effect and music hope that add more tho so far i havent seen any hackers frontier gave us a complete game and add content after that instead of trying to pack all the planned content and delay the full game release like star citizen my opinion dont flame me please passenger mission they updated the neutron stars mind blown by the sight new player power d tho im not a powerplayer 22 improved my performance somehow used to stutter in station every fkin time but now no more even on different type of station with new skinno stutter good sign good thing federal corvette paintjobs finally oh not to mention my favourite chirstmas tree booblehead meh awesome lore but require research on the internet to know more background simulation powerplay time consuming not suitable for casual gamers depends on how you treat the game you want big ship you have to invest some time in this game instance problem well i cant blame them tho cons difficult npc grind feast used to but not now very boring if you have to wait 15 mins to reach a destination and betweern that time theres nothing to do in the game very sintgy on hyperspace jump range edit not anymore combat logging player force quit the game while hes in a pvp fight long searching in cqc pirating in this game is dead exploration is good but not good enough lack of planetary surface activity frontier have one of the best support team in all the games that ive played the community too one of the best community in game ive ever been through summary elite dangerous is a basically a box for you to be filled,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,a review of elitedangerous using quotes from other steam reviewers who have said the game is not recommended once the novelty of that wears off you realize this game is utterly devoid of content 829 hours on record not worth the time 902 hours on record everything else is dull repetitive boring and empty even on multiplayer 933 hours on record the game play however leaves me desiring something a little less tedious and frustrating 978 hours on record elite dangerous is a difficult title to recommend 125 hours on record ive tried over and over again to enjoy this title 132 hours on record great fun to begin with and the combat system is pretty cool but ed quickly becomes repetitive 140 hours on record the thrill of seeing your first black hole or stumbling on a new type of exotic star or dropping out of supercruise to surf the debris rings around a jovian cant overcome the vast emptiness of elites galaxy 1421 hours on record do not buy this game it is a complete waste of your money and time 1487 hours on record when making your decision if you like the game type assume that youll get 100 120 hrs of gameplay before it gets boring 1775 hours on record this game sucks one of the worst game in 35 years 2018 hours on record elite dangerous is not a good game there are simply not enough game components for a player to actually play 2082 hours on record its not feature complete and its not content complete all existing features are bare bones never or barely touched again after original release 2405 hours on record 1010 would eat st again 241 hours on record i find that the ammount of divergant play things you can do out of ship combat to by highly limited if not non existant 2533 hours on record a great space sim without a lot to do 2576 hours on record the game gets old fast 2599 hours on record its just too damn grindy 2785 hours on record enjoyable in small doses 279 hours on record this game is so monotonous it will make your irl job look like lots of fun 3094 hours on record i wanted to like this game i really did 323 hours on record hey goyim give us 40 to walk on planets oy vey 3295 hours on record elite dangerous has the foundation to be a good space sim but is completely lacking in actual content 3337 hours on record once you get use to the game youve seen all that it offers which isnt much 347 hours on record emplty pointless 3499 hours on record a game that has all the makings to be something special but never seems to deliver 3758 hours on record very gutted even for the sale price i wouldnt reccomend this game 3799 hours on record i regred every second that ive lost in this game that takes itself so seriously 4802 hours on record will i recommend this game no 5426 hours on record tedious grind that never ends 5698 hours on record if i wanted to progress any further id have to literally hand over my personal life to the devs that wasnt for me 7042 hours on record mile wide inch deep 1048 hours on record i had really high hopes for this game 17146 hours on record,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,for newbies curious about the game ive made a guide at the bottom of this review as to much irritation and annoyment all the guides are videos and it doesnt cover everything you should start out knowing elite dangerous is an amazing space simulator your hand isnt held you decide what you want to do and you create your own story and adventure some reviews will tell you that there isnt much to do and in a sense its true there are only a few things you can be an explorer and just simply go from station to station exploring areas and broadening your database and mind with breathtaking visuals throughout an immensely huge galaxy you could become a pirate and hunt down cargo to potentially gain lots of good loot to sell and become rich you could become a trader risk your life transporting legal and or illegal goods from one station to the next or you could become a bounty hunter and chase down those whove murdered thieved or drumroll followed by silence didnt pay their fines or you could become a miner moving from asteroid to asteroid trying to find profitable metals and minerals to process and sell the choice is yours while the first trailer isnt gameplay it could very well soon be that way developers have talked about two expansions they plan on releasing 1 being able to dock and get out of your ship to explore stations i dont know exactly what theyd plan to do with that specifically 2 planetary landings and exploration frontier wants to put in wildlife plant life full blown cities filled with people and most importantlybuggies so in other words this game isnt done in a way you could consider this a beta and it does have minor bugs and crashes every once in a while so it makes sense but it is a very polished solid and fun beta the negative people who just see this as pew pew you beat the game can officially go screw themselves oh and ill be very butthurt when you thumbs down my review for saying that i will cry so hard so please thumbs down my review for your griefer needs thank you another thing to note is that this is not just a solo experience the community is actually very friendly and its very fun to enter a wing and do things together so dont be shy use that chat feature frontier so cherishably put in so that you could complain about how no one talks or does anything together do i recommend this game wholeheartedly yes and itll only get a lot better in the futurewait this is the futurefrontier where are my dlc oh near future got it great space simulator and a must buy for futuristicspace game lovers or a great start to those who are new and curious about them this is the guide section i mentioned at the beginning of my review dont be ashamed or feel stupid using it because the game does have a steep learning curve also note that this guide is for keyboard and mouse users sorry hotas users nothing against you in order to use the wing party system simply hold shift and press w or alternatively press 2 in order to navigate tabs you use q and e and space bar will select things select a commander and highlight the choices and choose invite to wing if the person accepts you must go back into the friends tab and activate the nav lock on in order for either of you to follow one anothers location in deep space you must have your wing beacon on that is activated by pressing 4 or shiftd go to the functions tab highlight beacon and select wing note that every time you supercruise or go ftl it will go off so you have to reactivate it in order to balance or shift power to systems thrusters or weapons the default binds are the arrow keys youll know which one to press to shift power dont worry while in supercruise and locked on to a destination its best to start slowing down at around 10 seconds left reduce throttle until your line hits the blue area and make sure its at the bottom of that area as youll just go right past your destination otherwise dont worry about having to adjust after that point it will automatically control speed descent when prompted in order to assign scanners andor weapons press 4 and go to fire group you have the option to make them primary 1 or secondary 2 fire press space in order to set it to primary secondary or make it unusable you also have the option to put weaponsscanners in another group entirely press d to shift over and you will be in your secondary loadout you have the same option of setting to primary and secondary fire in order to switch between the two sets the default button is n in order to use a wake scanner target t a wake in supercruise and follow your destination meters to slow down to the appropriate speed and you will automatically shift when in range in order to hyper jump and follow someone you must deploy it in regular movement and hold down whichever you assigned the scanner to primary or secondary after the wake has been scanned simply increase throttle and press j once prompted align your ship with the destination vector and you will warp to the commanders location if you have any questions feel free to post a question and i will do my best to answer happy gaming,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,no mans sky alternative 1 personally find it more enjoyable to play 2 the attention to detail and whole atmopshere of it is more vivid and immersive 3 actually has multiplayer 4 you actually have a purpose 5 variety in things you can do 6 actual meaningful decisions all in all better than no mans sky,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,captains log will and testament star date 05042015 pilots i write to you from the docking bay of aristotle city im currently monitoring the space chatter and theres a rather irate cmdr out there who needs to dock and wants my butt out well he can jolly well wait hes threatened to pop a laser cap in my sidewinder and im currently shaking in my space pants i dont care this is my fourth sidewinder in as many days its tough out there in the great black if your current rating is super noob im trying to make money honestly no contraband no smuggling and no combat im just a space guy looking to make his way on the right side of the law but it is tough theres limited contracts out there for an honest man i tried a little commodity shifting in between bulletins but er unfortunately some idiot ok me remapped the cargo jettison key right under the escape key so i lost about 690 credits worth of computer components when exiting my sidewinder menus i tried to scoop them up but im throttle happy and just kept whizzing by until they disintegrated i tried exploring but flew a little too close to a red dwarf and fried my beans i succumbed and took on shall we say a less than legal mission to transport some scrap out into ltt387 man it was a long way out but i persevered hopped to docking points to refuel planned my route carefully i was going to make it i jumped into the sector and for once was not hurtling towards the planet at ohmygod miles an hour and the clock was ticking two minutes to pay day two minutes to get some moolah and start outfitting my loaned ship heck maybe even save for my own but no a space pirate named agent orange appears wing commander style and tells me now you die i made a dash for the escape vector but all i achieved was a centrifrugal spin right in his gun sights i panicked i jettisoned my cargo again damn that mapping i died again and now here i sit in dock my fourth ship noob carrier iv and just waiting for that big payday just itching to get out there in the vaccuum and make my way i have 983 credits to my name and an insurance policy that buckling under my ridiculous claims i dont know how to fly straight can just about navigate and have bounced off the side for too many docking stations to be invited in again but by all the space gods i love this game captain noob signing off,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if you like eve online but hate the sub and want to witness things in first person this is the game for you also a great plug and play for the oculus,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,yes mans sky,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if you play elitie dangerous expecting it to have a predetermined story guidelines to follow or tutorials that hold your hand at all then this game isnt for you however if youre looking for a game that gives you the chance to pilot your personal starship across the galaxy pirate trade bounty hunt and mine asteroids at will then this game might actuall suit you also dont mistake my saying that this game has no predetermined story as meaning that it has no story in fact it has thousands of stories progressing in real time you find yourself mining in peace only to hear a news broadcast about a slave revolt in a nearby star cluster if they succeed the star systems economy would tank and the ore youre mining would become worthless you think to yourself armed with motive you swap out your mining laser for a multicannon at the nearest orbital station and head to the conflict zone helping to quiet the revolt this game is a sandbox the story constantly changing and told through pieces of information you gather from every station across the galaxy can be molded into whatever shape suits your needs and desires at the time like to rp this game is your best friend in space thats all for now see you in the stars my fellow commanders cmdr azzaranda out,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i may be exaggerating but the only thought that comes to my mind about ed right now is that this is the kind of game i wanted eve online to be when i gave it a try back in 2004 do i recommend it if you want a space sim with virtually no bounds where you start as a nobody to carve out your own path this is your game the 400 billion stars of our very own milky way will become your playground old timers whove seen much steeper learning curves than this wont have much trouble new guys however will need patience and the foreknowledge that in this game theres no such thing as instant gratification its called elite for a reason,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,initial impressions elite dangerous has amazing graphics sound and controls for a space dogfighting game it lacks direction for the player and is a complete sandbox that will probably keep many casual gamers away but this is a great game if you are willing to put in some time to get started and figure it out the graphics and sound still blow me away update after 20 hours of gameplay i can start seeing the bigger picture ive also shown this game to a few friends and we now have a group of seven people for our private group you play on a private server with people in your group exploration is very time consuming but a lot a of fun its mostly predicting where planetssolar systems will be in a specific system and trying to find them with scanners were currently trying to find unexplored systems with good spots to bounty huntbuy shipstrade combat is what keeps me the playing the game for many hours at a time dog fighting is very satisfying and everything about it just feels right controlling the multiple systems while in a fast paced battle results in vastly different skill levels amongst different players this doesnt mean you need skill to do combat you simply adapt your skill to a style the best players can play in fast ships with close range weapons while others can back you up with missles take shields off with lasers or even snipe with railguns none of us have engaged in trading as of yet likely to try it out once we can afford some nice trading ships we do know that exploration ties heavily into trading finding two systems that have differing functions close to eachother results in easy money from trading as they will buy the other systems goods knowledge is a great source of power and wealth in elite dangerous our group started with goals the first being to find a system to call home and work around followed by finding shipyards and stations with good ships and outfitting services which we are still working on later goals are likely to be extensive exploration checking out faction wars picking minor factions to support in our turf havent decided if we want to play in the open world format we are actually just looking to get our private group big enough to enjoy all aspects of the game as this game is a ton of fun with friends game has been a load of fun for us if you like space simulation games youll enjoy elite dangerous might want to wait for the price to drop if you are unsure but i think many players will enjoy the game as long as they know what they are getting into there is no main story there is no real direction of you need to go here and do this you start in a station and can do whatever you want which many people will take hours just figuring out what that even means if you create that direction for yourself this just might be the space sim you always wanted if not you will likely quit from boredom within a couple days explore trade and fight in 400000000000 systems that are all massive in scale themselves,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i am cmdr dnath and i approve of this game make sure you can be creative when playingno hand holding play for fun not just to grind become immersed in a seamless universe bring friends 20hrs in i can land hyper jump takeoff run bounties trade exchange and maneuver my shipfor the most part haha i say this lightly but make sure you learn the mechanics before discarding as tooo hard the time invested will pay out i am learning more every flight 40hrs still flying went for some combat upgraded my eagle and started bounty hunting not looking back at the life of a peddler now the sweet smell of overheating pulse lasers and rocket fumes are overwhelmingly joyous into the voidnbsp,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,the game grows on you at first i felt mile wide inch deep youve seen one star system youve seen them all whats the point but still the game kept calling me back and i realized the rp potential of the game is insane by rp i dont mean how art thou galadriel shall we absconce and slay the evil wizard i mean that the players ability to really immerse themselves into being a grizzled freighter captain or bounty hunter or merchant or miner or whatever have you is off the charts you can play this game in so many ways it can play like euro trucker or farming simulator you can operate a passenger cruise line you can play it like a mogul hiring other ships and crew or you can be the solo fighter pilot or explorer landing on planets and seeing whats in that cave over there the amount of time this game can absorb is scary i feel like it can easily take over a life forget star citizen this is the real star citizen the committment and plans the devs have is amazing see this isnt like a game where they just made it and theyre done they have mutiple planned expansions for opening up new aspects of the game making it deeper richer more immersive just when you think youve mastered being a fighter pilot its like here do the same thing on this moon here try engineering here hire a crew it just keeps expanding with more and more content more things to do eve was good i have to say eve is real good star citizen is ambitious but probably vaporware elite dangerous is the definitive space game of our time my eve account is permanently mothballed in favor of ed yes absolutely get it try to get it on sale but even if you dont its worth it,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,decide to start bounty hunting finally get a viper buy epic weapons for it no money left fly to nav beacon start getting bounties anaconda flies in wanted for 200000 credits everyone goes after it i get heavily damaged manage to get the kill and bounty try to warp out but thrusters malfunctioning go into super cruise and lose control of my ship accidently fly towards the sun get too close and die of overheating 1010 would fly into the sun again,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ever wanna be a bountyhunter like spike from coyboy bebop well now you can ever wanna be a explorer like jeanluc picard from star trek well now you can ever wanna be a a pirate like jack sparrow but in space instead well now you can ever wanna be a cult leader with a giant ship well now you can ever wanna be a fruit vendor on lhs 1776 well now you can ever wanna be a whatever the hell you wanna be with spaceships well now you can ps its like like eve put in first person without a subscription and a friendly community good graphics,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,played almost a hundred hours in a week so id say its ok seriously though i wasnt sure this game would draw me as i was looking to pass the time till star citizen and no mans sky but boy did this one hook me yes it is repetitive yes you cant land on planets yes there is no offline mode but overshadowing all these is the sense that this game is actually alive and real you are a nobody in the whole wide universe but work with the community and you can change it little by little help terraform a planet and expand civilization by transporting the necessary materials side with the rebels in a star system to overthrow the existing goverment or the opposite crush the resistance by taking part in the war and who knows what the devs will come up with next best part for me though is you can play vastly different roles that actually matter even if only a tiny bit within the universe and you can do this playing solo no griefers and still all the community fun exploration 400 billion stars to explore the fun is in finding desirable rare things such as earthlike planets and black holes then selling the cartographic data for profit and also putting your name on a planet as the first to discover it will you play it safe making short trips near on the edges of civilization or will you go an a monthlong journey to explore the edges of the galaxy what if you carry data worth millions and happen upon a skilled pirate pirating its not always as simple as blowing up other players many pirates will let you go for a price but pirates beware for as soon as you commit any crime inside civilized star systems you should be very afraid when another ship beginns to scan you youll be hunted down if you happen upon a security ship or even worse bounty hunters youll be having fun hunting pirates taking part in small or large scale wars or why not team up wings with a trader and see hiim safely through anarchy space for a price traders if you fancy yourself as a trader prepare to be noting down prices alot or use online crowdsourcing tools searching the map for industrial and hightech places or agricultural and terraforing places etc to trade between or maybe youll make your mark as a trader of rare goods which become more profitable the farther away you sell them miners tired of blowing up ships then blow up some rocks youll be searching for pristine metallic reserves in asteroid belts and rings hunting down the pieces you laser off said asteroids and racing to a place in need of your metals and minerals beware though pirates are aware of your favorite places all in all if youre looking for an immersive experience look no further just be patient in the beginning while learning the controls and understanding how the universe and your ships parts work it is well worth it and this coming from a player who really seldomly plays the same game more than a couple hours,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,still trying to figure out how to park my ship,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,couldnt figure out why my ship was burning up while flying by a sun attacked multiple times by pirates for just flying through space crashed multiple times getting in and out of stations had fun the whole time,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,first impressions i literally cannot stop ing spinning getting more confident runs into an asteroid and almost sharts self finally got the hang of it wanted to leave the hanger at full speed and blast off into the distance like a badass to get some star wars battlefront ii space battle nostalgia but ended up slamming into the rim of the forcefield generator then went into hyperspeed and almost crashed into the sun now my ship is almost destroyed and i have one minute until i run out of oxygen 1110 would go through pilot training again,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,stick with it difficult to start with i found the learning curve very hard to deal with after rage quitting i actually sat down watched some videos and tutorials and it opened my mind up to the game and made it much more enjoyable dont just jump straight in do the training watch some vidoes on youtube to get the full experience i feel i am about to lose a whole lot of time on this looks superb runs smooth great with friends,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,elite has taught me one thing if you find something for free deploy your weapons or run actually might be best to just run 6 on 1 vulture love should only be between consenting ships and i sure as hell didnt consent 1010,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,update this game is addicting i was thinking about it during sex some people complaining dont know what to do i was in space for 4hrs straight not inching closer to my destination at all i was 16 days away in real human life time as in i needed to sit there for 16 days playing to reach my destination however once i figured it out i was there in 10 minsanyway if you can stick with it put the effort into research aka play with google on your phone in hand it slowly gets easier and once its easy this is as amazing as it gets theres one feature in this game i wasnt expecting conflict zones you can go tolow and high intensity zones like going to another star or planet when you get there you will see alot of npcs battling it out all over the place in a star wars style battle oh yes there will be players attracted to the fun i cant tell you how many were at the low intensity one i was at but im gonna guess maybe 9and then30 or 40 computer fightershell maybe more i think if the npcs die they respawn as another ship so the battle never stops these zones come and go as wars end new ones pop up its awsome because i was expecting player battles to almost be staged as in hey everyone meet here at this time for said epic battlei am thoroughly pleased to know if i get bored of space exploring i can just literally turn to fighting in large scale engagements its an amazing thing i saw traveling to my first real planet and i grinned as ships exploded around me and lazers went off everywherejust like the store page video the thing some people wanna say isnt in the game they are wrong these zones can be seen and are in world with all players so you could be an explorer and look out your window to see a big battle as you pass it by but this is a sim so if you die you wont respawn in the thick of it like the ai will youll respawn at the start and youll have to travel back to the battle update i did transport missions until i was able to buy a better ship and if you chat through the in game comms with players its the coolest thing ive ever heard online transmission static and noise but done right its wicked cool joystick recommended amazing immerison ps my buddy is black and the feds scanned his ship at a docking hub then told him to move alongive never been scanned docking i have 3 times the hours he does the missions are a way to make money youll find them on the bulletin board in starports the world feels alive i was attacked by a pirate ai ship in mid supercruise and ai 3 police eagles came to aide me they actually saved me i have seen fleets im talking wings of 12 ships or more cruising around together 1 of them was a gang i went to an asteriod belt saw 20 something mining ships blasting asteriods with lasers then scooping up the smaller rocktheres was also a war going on in 1 galaxy i went to big one lots of battles the docs and ports are beautiful full of life and ships buzzing about in epic scale on some of the more popular ones im talking ships coming and going constantly 98 real players the stations have extreme detail with little trucks drving about on them blinking lights and many many docking bays you will be issued clearence from them and given a specific dock to park at at the docks you can order beer wine liquor food uogrades weapons ships missions the list goes on for a long time the immersion is spot on its very real to me there can be alot of downtime in the game as you travel wellspace whats neat is how theres routes that are well travels by other players and frigates and then theres just deep space where you wont see much the game always looks amazing after watching interstellar earlier and how beautiful the scenes were in that movie this game is on par with it everything is jaw dropping pretty you can invite players and buddies to be your wingmen or even recruit up to 3 ai ships to follow you where ever i dont know any other space game that you can explore so far that you could literally be 24hrs from the nearest human in real time flight thats is space my friends you can feel crowded in a large battle or feel more alone then playing doom anyway i read the postive and negative reviews got the game because i wanted to be an astronaut today taking a chance and at one point35hrs ini was lost confused bored overwhlemed shaking my head running out of fuel and air thinking i bought the wrong game this is just too much and thenit all clicked like a light bulb and within 20 mins i was engaging fighters in massive dog fights some kinda federal navy ships attacking man i dont know i promise thisif you stick it out figure it out and it sucks to do but once you get itit may very well be considered one of the best space games out there i personallywell lets see i bought it 6hrs ago i logged in 6hrs its 7am i dont want to go to bed or work i dislike earth now i died twice once intentionally because i was confused and wanted to start over and the otheri accidently slammed into a space station the size of texas at a high rate of speed in my 1 man fighter for once im glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews you should still read them they give some insight but some of their chief complaints were space is too big make the map smaller ughwhat ofcourse you dont see another player when you get way out there in deep space isnt that the point of way out there can you imagine the excitement of running into someone if you ever did 70hrs of gameplay away from the spawn talk about adrenaline if you wanna see people some stay in middle space wanne see them everywhere stay in civliized space game could use solitare mine sweeper and angry birds on in dash computer to help pass time in deep space if your worried you wont grasp ityou willyou paid 60 bucks for ityou wont stop til you get it so you dont have that lost money sinking feeling in your heart anymore evntually that will turn into a sense of accomplishment and pride that you stuck it out the graphics are out of this world pun intendedand i truly feel that i have first hand experience now at crashing into a space station in closing yes this is a sim i dont understand what else you do other then explore meet people form a group maybe fight those massive battles in the conflict zones anywhere can be a conflict zone just these are dedicated with a bunch of ai etc upgrade your ship with customizables and guns etc trading mining piracy blow stuff up missionstransport this protect this ship attack this ship go to this planet deliver this cargo so i dont understand what else these guys expect in space you can add your buddies and see their locations and meet up places so your not left traversing for years calling out for each other asking players have you seen so and so but your buddy must be in a galaxy or system if they are in deep space then you wont know where they are if you like space your really doing yourself an injustice not getting it i think this game is worth 60 bucks and is the 3rd 60 dollar pc game ive ever bought i like the 19993999 games ya catch my drift but i think in this game youll die in real life of old age before you ever see the whole map for the record i skipped the training i heard it wasnt helpful its easier if you and a buddy share the learning curve try to make a friend at the starting dockor play with a steam friend unless you wanna be solo joe by all means do so most do or as i said in the beginning google bing yahoo whatever some kinda search engine and start learning to be an anstronaut from others mistakes and helpful videos and tutorials update bought a joystick today mouse and keyboard in combat is more difficult then a trex tryna do pushups,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,ground rules for elite dangerous 1there is no up accept this and things will be easier 2if you think you had good depth perception this game will make you question that 3 you are puny deal with it everything in this game is bigger than you day 1 skip training plunge head first into a massive 400billion solar system space game day 2 figured out how to move the ship accepted a mission mission ran out of time before i figured out how to even go about doing the mission or even getting to the area day 3 still have my first ship all is going well floating about mining or attempting to mine an astroid belt got too close to the sun and slightly melted my ship day 3 got a fine of 400 credits for being told i could dock when i couldnt gtgt day 4 made 100k mining after travelling for 1 hr to a random system think ima stay got a new ship not made it to day 5 yet day wait month err december i think time gets away from you in space too many suns not enough sets so i literally and i mean literally have a massive beard now i look like a freaking pirate i was a pirate for a while but now im not im just a guy with a beard i decided to add this before horizons given the title name i may gain a sense of time again the game thus far has been fun i upgraded and brought a joy stick 1010 would buy one again for this game cant see how i ever managed before its like trying to drive a car with a keyboard doablebut should you for the safety of others and youre ship dont the game has also been lonely its so freaking big like my beard things get lost in it but the end goal is for everyone make money buy a better ship id like to see player owned manufacturing facilities on planets now we have horizons and i think a player owned minior factions would be nice i always like the eve universe being shaped by players i did not how ever like all the freaking wars all the time but i found the general population to be really nice so far thats about 10 people give or take a few body parts and beards or does a beard count as a body part,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,okay ill review this game super short this game isnt for casual gamers cause of 1 simple reason its too immersive if you are looking to get straight into action kill people etc this game isnt for you this game is for people that are looking to immerse themselves in the game to forget about stuff that you think about every day and just be in a ship be a pirate mine stuff kill pirates explore spin 247 cause you didnt do the tutorial 1010 going to buy this game to my friend you should give it to people that look sad to make them happy,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,almost 30 years ago i dreamed about traveling in space almost 20 years ago i dreamed about game where i could do it just almost 2 years ago i bought elite base game year ago i bought horizons expansion with beta access almost year ago i bought r9 290 graphics card to be able to handle planets in this game 6 months ago i bought 32inch display only for this game well thats what i could afford and fiew dayds ago i bought saitek x52 pro flight hotas i bought paintjobs for almost all ships in game what does it mean it means elite dangerous is really a great space game the best space game we know now this game some how changed my life it is not just a game anymore i even call it a lifestyle thanks to frontier,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,first off awesome game if you like awesome i do recommend it use a joystick go through the training watch the youtube tutorials if you dont do the last two first you will be doing it later though the game is not super complex without knowing a few of the basics you will get lost and traveling at ludicrous speed and trying to figure out how you get out of supercruise is not a fun chore the game really shines everywhere in my opinion it is beyond measure in size it is beautiful even on an nvidia 660ti the combat is fun but what i love most the immersion how do they do it you ask there is nothing you cant do from your cockpit in fact everything is done in the cockpit as though you were sitting in the seat of your own spacecraft need to check what sun that is you are flying dang near into turn your head to the left need to get into your ships subsystems and turn on some external lights so you can see the wreckage you found exploring turn your head right the way the menus are done just floors me i feel like i am really there story time so today about 7 hours into my actual game play i ended up getting a little to close to a sun got warm ok not just warm like hot and it started to fry my systems i lost lifesupport shield recharger and my ftl crud going to run out of oxygen in 430how do i get to a station for repairs in 4 minutes without my ftl welllets see what sort of systems we have in this thingholy smokes a reboot and repair option under my subsystems lets give it a shot ship goes dark sun is bright ship systems rebooting whoa what the heck ftl has been repaired to 10 i can divert all shield power and scanners to my ftl to get it to spool up and wammo on our way to repair city that right there was probably the best experiance i have had in a game since master chief met the flood for the first time i cant wait to see what tomorrow brings i am headed out to a system a bit farther from the start do some exploring come back and sell my data i think it will be a good day for those that stuck with it and maybe enjoyed what i wrote i hope it helps,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,elite space trucker i say this as a compliment this game is unique as its one of the few games to truly embrace what is required for a game to have serious longevity massive amounts of boredom seperated by instances of knee jerkery what i just said probably wont interest most players though and thats the real shame here since this is an incredibly well done experience the level of immersion in this game is borderline annoying but somehow that just makes everything better in this quasi mmo experience you are not a unique and special snowflake like in every other mmo experience you arent here to save the world you are not the prophecy fufilled and no one cares about what you do just attempt to learn how to pilot your ship try to make money and generally just get byand thats pretty much everything you need to know about this game i recommend everyone buy this game not because i know every one of you will like it i want you to buy it to give more money to the developers so they can continue expanding this amazing game but if you dont like it and you feel you wasted your money then you should come back here and say this review was helpful because clearly i warned you seriously i really did my best to warn you,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,when i first started playing i thought i was never going to acclimate to the seemingly overlycomplicated flight system all i wanted was a freelanceresque frolic through space i wanted to be a bounty hunter or a pirate or a trader or an ace pilot or whatever my desires drew me to then after a few hours of dicking with the controls i finally understood how this game worked it all clicked and then i realised this game is a sandbox you can quite literally do whatever you want see a trader blow it up steal his cargo see a wanted criminal kill him and collect your bounty notice that certain resources sell really high on a particular station go load up and haul them over do missions for the federation or for the empire or for any one of hundreds of subfactions all vying for power theres so many factions by the way anything from trader groups to treasure hunters you can join up with basically anyone and run missions withfor them you could even go passivist and just carry passengers from one end of the galaxy to another theres an entire ingame market for that and it pays really well the universe is your oyster you just have to figure out the tools to crack it open tldr do anything you want as long as you get paid in space,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,this game has so much potential if youre expecting a big epic space adventure you may or may not get it depending on what your definition of epic is i find expecting it to be sorta a space truck simulator keeps my hopes undashed its fun to wing up with friends problem is you never really encounter as many people as you see in the trailers theyre few and far between how big this galaxy is is really a blessing and curse its impressive but not always fun theres really not much to the horizons expansion you can land on planets but only planets that are entirely rock theres a lot to be desired with the planetary exploration as of now its just big rocks of different colors sometimes with a dock or two occupying a speck of an otherwise bleak and empty world apparently theres more to come later this year though idk i still enjoy the game its a major grind fest though what action you find will almost always just be against npcs theres lots of time spent just kinda driving its fun impressive big but certainly has its drawbacks,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,a spaceship simulator where human inhabited space is a bit like the wild west and youre just out to make an living out of it im coming to this game as someone who never played any of the previous elite games and i play this game with a cheap hotas joystick and i dont personally wing up with other players online you start off in a very basic jack of all trades ship you work your way up by doing missions carrying cargo couriering exploring combat bounty hunting mining assassinations smuggling and finding buyers for your goods buy new ships attain upgrades and rank up with the various factions no central story but there is an evolving political environment that responds to player community actions right now there are 29 ships in the main universe that you could pilot each one handles differently most of them can serve different roles better than others plenty of different loadout customisations for your ships including many different weapon utilities and internal compartments the good for this game includes the sheer size and scope of the universe travel faster than the speed of light from mercury to saturn and watch as the surface detail of the rings slowly come into focus a scientifically accurate modelling of the playable galaxy based on the real world milky way customisable and flexible ships to suit your playstyle exciting dogfighting combat easy to drop whatever task youre doing and do something else in game graphics can be stunning sounds are amazing runs fantastic with my gtx 680 2560x1080 ultrawide comfortably over 60fps i would also say that my experince has been positive when it comes to bugs they are generally quite rare developers are always adding new content to both the base game elite dangerous and the horizons dlc the neutral for this game would be that the close quarter combat gamewithinagame feature can be difficult to find other players if you care about this mode huge size of the game means it can be rare to find other players in game if an true offline mode is required for you you might want to give the game a miss as the solo mode still requires internet access to update the ingame markets community goals and exploration data the biggest negative for this game for me would be that without the horizons dlc the exploration aspect of this game would be extremely bare bones you jump to locations and point your ship at intesting planetary bodies to gain information about them and sell this information at the time of writing this review i wouldnt say that the dlc is required for enjoyment but that may change before the end of the year with the introduction of the ability to launch your own minifighter ships from larger ships tldr its eurotruck simulator but in space and in a spaceship and you can blow up the traffic instead if you want,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i ran out of fuel in a middle of far away uncolonised solar system no stations for atleast another 40000 light years it was at this moment i knew i was screwed i turned off my engines life support and all none vitals an eery silence set in as i started gasping for breath 4 mins left of oxygen dont panic i tell my self while looking into the black abyss i light up a cig while looking at the self destruct button and contemplating letting go of all i fought for80 tonnes of cargo solar system after solar system of map data and most of all my precious ship i bring up my firefox a quick google search help im stuck in space and have no fuel first result fuelratscom holy is this real i think to myself only one way to find out i turn back on life support and continue to breathe again and frantically input my commander name and location within 20 minuites a beautiful sight was seen on the horizon my saviour luck would have it the fuel rats came and transfered some fuel to me enough to make it back to the nearest space station with my hefty cargo hold if only they knew what was in there i just hoped they wouldnt do a cargo scan this is why i love this game its a game where you create your own stories and live them out fully fleshed anything can happen at anytime while online and the most immersive space sim anyone could own there are many communities in the game such as the fuelrats that go out of their way to make the very expansive world feel more full of life its the community in this game that really make it feel like a living breathing world 1010 would not plan my space route again,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,absolutely amazing controls are meh but fking god this game is beautiful and so fun to just explore the map is huge and the gameplay is great only things that i see bad about it are the controls you get lost easily and it just came to steam after a while of being out on its own website still love it,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i know a lot of people hate the grind to this game but it only is a grind if you make it one elite dangerous is a truly immersive game with plenty of opurtunitys in game i personally am a fan of bounty hunting myself but as long as you dont push yourself in and endless grind its a great game only when you grind for end game content does the game lose its fun but if you just go with the natural progression it goes by quite fast overall i give this game 8510 stars,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,its a shame that casuals are not recommending it because it is too complex when it comes to the game i have never been entranced like this since i last played skyrim or civilizaiton v and i spent at least 100hrs in both nice ui often a little confusing however and there is basically no instruction which i like there are no goals apart from your own agenda which i also like the colour pallette is ok and i felt inspired by wonder quite a few times but apart from that the planets look relatively simaliar the cockpit is astonishingly detailed and the universe is astonishingly big,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if you liked euro truck simulator then youll like this game,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,alright listen up i dont usually recommend games because im either too busy chopping wood or lifting heavy things so you know that when one of these pops up here from me the game either terrrifyingly good or amazingly bad elite dangerous with a name like that you can be sure that this game will start giving you heart palpitations the moment you slide your mouse over that add to cart button two very strong very hard words makes my palms sweaty just thinking about it mmmfff the game drops you into a tiny spaceship with a thousand bucks in your pocket and it is up to you yeah you to make the most of the huge playable world and endless amount of content no missions no storyline no bullsht this game aint going to hold your hand just like me i aint gonna hold your hand what are you some kinda sissy be a miner a trader a vigilante bounty hunter pirate scum anything you want to be you can do it go where you want when you want and dont give two spits about who the hell is trying to rob me because theres always someone out there be it fellow spacegame enthusiast like you or a scheming little npc who is looking to steal that one package of dehydrated milk youre trying to transport across the system basically 1010 because some weasel tried to suck me out of my supercruise to steal my three packages of tea which i worked way too hard to find a station in this universe that sells tea its tea people irregadless i escaped that snake went back to his faction told them thirteen tons of animal meat and completely crashed their economy i went on to find that slimy mole and sent him tumbling into a star before i got paid and spent it all on generic alcohol and cigars you can smoke in space,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,edit powerplay info added link for starters guide below do not let the play time fool you i have over a thousand hours in this game frontier unlocked steam keys to beta backers and now i get to write a review about this game 1 this game is amazing do not let any of the negative reviews complaining about the lack of content fool you this game grows and adds more content about every 23 months as proof the powerplay update added a whole new way to play as a free patch there is a whole political factions system to play with now the development team is active and works with the community frequently 2 there is no mistake this game is hard not like your normal hard but kick you in the pants hard and when you fall over crying kick you in the face for good measure you need to do the training do the docking training 4 or five times if you still wanting more i made an instructional set about some of the things training does not cover youtube video navigation leaving the starting area elite dangerous starter guide 1nbsp,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,people say you dont have much to do in this game they say is too complicated and thats easy to get overwhelmed i have been a fan of the space genere for years played descent combat flight simulator wing commander and a lot of other games if you are a space fan like dogfighting twitch control of your ship this game is for you it feels so satisfying that i cannot even begin to explain they also have a long list of features they want to add to the game half of them sound surreal on my side im very happy with the game as it is but if they add more stuff or expansions i have to buy all i have to say is shut up and take my money please take my money,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i am somewhat new to flight games so this is a new experience to me i wanted to play star citizen but my pc could not run it well this game is very optimized and runs fine with my gtx 650 2gb saying i am a noob there is a learning curve but do not quit when you first start right now i am not very good but with practice i will become better pros very optimized fun gameplay good if you dont like to be pointed in a direction cons learning curveif you are new but with practice will get better probrably better if you have a joystick or something like thatkeyboard and mice is fine though just preferance you have to do things yourself without much helpi do not mind since i like to do my own thing final verdict i personally thing this game is very fun and also challenging if you like to do your own thing and like space sims this is for you i plan on putting many more hours on this game right after this review is posted,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if you have an xbox 360 controler set the option to advence gamepad then train on landind and navigation is the staring most needed skill you can choose between single player or multi player i would advise single player untill you get the hang of the controls this game has a complex controll system that shows the depth of this game you can pick a name for youself then later choose male or female geting into the traing station requires you to spin the ship while going through air lock dont forget to call the station for clearance and basic stations needs you to fly around looking for landing point center on landing point then face forward on landing pad with gear down to dock with station try not to get greedy on your first mission my first mission requred 3 system jumps to complete,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,direct to rift dk2 support i7920 gtx 760 24gb ddr3 samsung ssd dk2 decent frames some jutter in asteroids tried the game with mouse and kb was all over the place tried xbone pad was better after playing for a couple minutes i had to order a hotas and a gtx980 to make it better well worth it so much awesome,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,elite is a special kind of game it is one of those games you just have to like to have fund with it is similar to flight simulators or even arma you either like it or you do not if you like it you will have the time of your life and it will be easy to look over all of its problems without regert but if you dislike it well then it feels like the biggest piece of garbage you can buy for money if you enjoy games with atmosphere that put you in a gigantic world where you are on your own without any big instructions on what to do elite is your kind of game do you like amazing graphics and awesome scenery to make screenshots off possibly seeing things noone has ever seen before then elite is for you you enjoy having to chose from a large variety of things to do in a game with none of them being mandatory at all then elite is something you will like do you enjoy cooperative rpgs where you can team up to gain an advantage then you will have fun with this game elite offers an entire realistic galaxy with many things to do become a miner a trader a pirate a soldier an explorer a bounty hunter a rescue operator a mercenary a faction leader all that is possible in elite even weird fuses between those jobs the galaxy simulation features real time trading between systems that is influenced by both npcs and players alike if you sell a large amount of mineral a to system x then the demand for that mineral will go down and the price will drop as they do not need as much of that mineral anymore smuggle a load of slaves into a station and watch it have an ecnomic boom kill system authorithy vessels and watch as the whole system slowly shifts who is in charge or even goes into complete anarchy the power play factions are having an entire war in our milky way the so called bubble is the main playground for those a cluster of systems around the earth where everything began you can pledgy allegiance to one of those factions and perform missions for them gather intel about other systems to allow your faction to expand into it at some point activly help the navy of your factions in combat zones when attacking or defending a system do that in order to keep the influence in that system up or tear the influence of another system down gain merits by doing so leveling you up in the ranks of your faction to allow bigger weekly payouts dont enjoy any of the things named above elite also allows for many other things to do for instance you can just build an exploration ship and go explore the entire milky way yes i said the entire milky way think somewhat like 4000000000 systems there is also quite some money to be made when finding special bodies or even finding things noone has found before upgrade your ships internal parts shields hull sensors thrusters frameshiftdrive power distributor power plant weapons gadgets cargo reinforcement scanners you name it if that is not even enough for you the season pass even allows you to farm for special upgrades able to be applied on certain parts of your ship negative things about elite while it is a very beautiful and special game in my opinion elite currently has a lot of problems getting into the game without help is very hard you need at least some sort of information source like reddit if you do not want to spent hours and hours figuring out how things work this is a very unique expierence but most people will not like finding out everything on their own the ai can sometimes be completely random and just attack you on sight without hesitation causing a lot of frustration some materials especially for the engineers dlc under the season pass can be annoyingly hard to obtain and the outcome of the recipes are completely randomized so even a few douzen hours of farming can still leave you with something worse than the stock version grinding in general is something any progress oriented player will dislike it takes a long time to get those 155 million credits for that one ship you wanted and even if you are doing something that gets a good amount of money youll have to redo it over and over again not much change found there playing without a proper input like at least a controller if not a joystick or even something more professional leaves out a lot of the fun this game just plays better with good equipment it even has vr support to make it even better overall i would recommand this game to anyone that likes space simulators or that is a fan of flight sims elite is a unique space flight sim rpg hybrid but a lot of fun if you manage to get into it,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,start out supier cool looking stars are beautiful ship looks like its a damn ship with blind spots see new other ships i want new shinies start to grind it out with exploration spend 7 hours flying about getting data start to feel sleepy see last star in sector and then off to sell my data to the station in sector get interdicted because tired freak out and manage to jump away right into the sun i just scaned heat sink save me doesnt work too much heat ship explodes entire day wasted but i dont really care would still spend entire day just to have a sun kill me 1010,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,if your a fan of eve but wished that you were actually flying this is the game for you if your a fan of the space sim x series but wished it was multiplayer this is the game for you if your waiting on star citizen but have an extra 60 i would highly recommend adding this this beautiful piece of art to your collection,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,a slow paced game its true but after 4 hours of space trucking when you hear the whoom of an interdiction tether and glance at the sensors to see a little red dot of an enemy player on your tail 448 tons of gold in the hold and a 10 million credit rebuy cost means if you die you will lose all the progress that 4 hours of trucking got you better hope you fronted the money for some decent shields and thrusters youre gonna need all your tricks to get out of this one pop chaff drop mines deploy the turrets and haul get a scan of the enemy ship if you can so you know how to play this one the chase is on and youre going to need all the help you can get it might only going to be a matter of seconds before you hear the dreaded shields offline taking damage this feeling is what keeps coming me back but the game has more to offer the galaxy map is beautiful on its own and exploring it is an almost spiritual experience watching stars and planets soar by investigating the valleys and mountains of a planet that you are likely the first to land on and finding rare stellar bodies like black holes and pulsars all these thrills really dont wear off the effort needed to find things like this makes them all the more rewarding especially if you are the first to find an interesting system the atmosphere of this game is excellent thanks to the beautiful sound and graphic design this game makes me feel like im in space the hours of enjoying the vast stillness of space is then shattered by a few seconds of pure adrenaline,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,i ing love this game period i will start with one thing this game could be considered boring to many people who arent interested in its game style and lack of leveling and any type of endingi personally arent that into the dog fighting aspect as fights can sometimes take quite a long time i will at least get into it oncel i obtain a better ship and systems however i am loving the exploring planning out a route through the stars finding new planets naming nebulae you happen to find first checking out different planets and reading all the different makeups of star systems and sometimes finding gems where a system could have 47 super massive stars the entire galaxy is ours to explore if you like developing good relations with certain government factions throughout the galaxy then there is plenty of trading opportunities and jobs available to take from simple trade missions to outstanding bounties on known criminals in nearby systems if you want to make a name for yourself in the galaxy here is ur chance as a scifi nerd gamer and science buff this game was made for someone like me who just wants to explore the galaxy and see all its wonders currently i an flying a eagle class ship making my way towards the inner galactic center where i hope to find the galactic black hole as i wish to watch as stars wizz by and the black hole eats everything that comes near,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,ok right from the start this is a review for a special kind of player many negative reviews are absolutly right about the lack of content and variety in the game i would go so far to say that this is a late beta which should have not been released for 60 bucks but if you someone fond of astronomics space travel star trek or sci fi in general even if you are not a gamer at allget this game just the fact that you can explore our entire milky way at todays knowledge with realistic graphics and scale gets you alone let me tell you about my first 30 hours in the game got into itlet not fool youits not overly complicated its just needs some work with the controls recommend at least a gamepad and the tutorialsand wanted nothing else than to explore since then i have not shot a single ship delivered exactly zero cargo and made no errand boy missions and despite of that reluctance of me to take part in this affairs i made a good coin just with the exploring data my only long term goal is to get the aspexplorer the best ship for exploring for a reasonable price and say good bye to humancivilized space if you buy into that you will be lost too,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,i am no veteran in the elite series neither am i an expert at simulators or survivor games bar stranded deep so my review is honest it is very in depth and well thought out you can trade become a pirate or a bounty hunter choice is yours and you can switch between the paths quite easily you build rep with factions with the list of factions being endless the world they have created is huge i mean huge my advice i highly recommend this game get straight into it but i must warn you that it doesnt offer much of a tutorial its just you your ship and endless vast nothingness that is space and whatever it may contain all in all if youre looking for an easy enjoyable worthyourmoney space sim look no further,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,absolutely stunning playing with a rifthotas setup and theres really nothing quite like it today i traveled 200x the speed of light smuggled some medicine to a few systems shot down some pirates discovered a star and i just made my first big bounty hunting score the sense of size and scale of the galaxy is really incredible cant recommend this game enough,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,this was a good game back in 80ties and its a still a good game then came no mans sky aka one mans lie and now this is the best game out there star citizen doesnt exist yet nms is and elite is playable and getting better every new update 810,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,simply amazing bought it last week and im hooked editwell 1300 hours later and i still love this game theres no story line to follow theres no real rules to follow you do whatever you want to do granted playing in solo all the time can become very grindy but in open having that feeling of terror when a wing of anacondas and pythons pledged to a different faction fly by is one of the greatest parts of the game ive met pirates who robbed me terrorists that killed me and political extortionists demanding i pledge to thier faction its freakin unreal this game has givin a new depth to online multiplayer interaction with 9 more years of additions comming i cant imagine whats next,1,0
359320,Elite Dangerous,you can be a trader pirate smuggler explorer bounty hunter or all of these above all else you can buy and do up ships this game can be so peaceful that you can watch the entire lord of the rings trilogy while playing so action packed that youll be racing to the nearest spaceport before your oxygen runs out while dodging multiple enemies who may be firing at you you will be confused you will get lost you will have to decide for yourself what to do next you will lose 100 of hours of your time and hundreds of millions of credits this is elite dangerous,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,first twenty hours playing i got bored from space trucking seriously was considering not recommending the game then i was able to mine for cash wanted to downvote even more then i said flip it imma be a space pirate and in the eleven hours of being a space pirate i had more fun than the twenty hours of space trucking point being try different things in elite you might find something you like eventually,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,absolute awesomness the price steered me away for a whilebut finally just got it man its worth every penny and then some serously youll then understand why its priced the way it is,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,uh i got it the 18th today is the 22nd i have over 75 hours played yeah i guess that says something,1,1
359320,Elite Dangerous,really fun game especially with friends scince the wings update can have a fairly steep learn curve but has a lot of things to do i find some people can be over whelmed by the game and write it off to easily,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,edit the starter edition mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists my approval still stands as a 30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time ill try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone ill preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that i was really into was titanfall causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers the starter edition is a smart implementation by ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many to be clear there is no difference between starter players and regular players besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new operators classes starter players play on the same servers as everyone else play on all the same maps and have all the same unlockable operators available as everyone else to explain how your starter game would begin ill briefly explain how this game rather generously doles out content all maps and operators are free and included in patches the operators only being paid for in time played or with ubibucks if desired this makes the season pass practically useless on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early mapoperator access which is now a six month or so privilege this means the player base isnt segmented and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the season pass or dlc that said the starter edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender along with enough ubibucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal everything you do in the game earns you renown which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skinscosmetics starter players require about 12000 renown to purchase an operator while regular players only need about 2000 ubisoft calls this grinding to reach 12000 but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesnt feel like grinding to reach anything the reward is that the game is fun to play that being said i know that ingame progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing titanfall if theres to be things to unlock im actually glad it is the operators in the 910 hours ive mainlined since buying the starter edition i earned enough renown to purchase an on sale at 7500 with a few thousand left over the grinding is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown and theres at least one operator on sale in rotation every week heres the thing though operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents my point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators youll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more andor bought a couple to see how they play that should be the clarifying out of the way ive always wanted to try this game from a glance it looked like the evolution of csgo ive waited years for without the harshness and indiemod nature of a game like insurgency and i wasnt far off like many people it was hard to justify a full 60 purchase when csgo is 15 and regularly goes on sale but ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me i want to address the issue of the full price for only multiplayer argument i dont see the issue as that was par for years ut2k4 quake 3 arena etc especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here this game doesnt need a campaign the addition of a highbudget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game teaching the player how to play is exactly what the singleplayer content does in fact do there are 10 situations each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills gadgets and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into siege multiplayer theres also the option to play coop terrorist hunt as a lone wolf instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself i only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future the game already has deadly bots for other singleplayer content and the possibility is definitely there why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter especially if youre experienced with them because nothing else on the market plays the way that siege does it is a slow game with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly the lean leftright buttons are essential to leaning around corners the time to die is extremely fast with 13 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading it might be a slow pace at times but it causes a whiteknuckle tension that i havent seen matched its thrilling to rappel up the side of a building toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush thats made me cheer out loud sometimes siege is like actionshooter chess a game thats simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master a high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay it may not be for you but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen the port if it even is a port is excellent offering all the options that pc players expect to scale from lowend to highend rigs it has 2 unique aa solutions an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even subpixel aliasing and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies msaa between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies it has builtin twitch streaming features it natively supports xbox 3601 controllers and dualshock 4 offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable basically the devs understand pc gaming and this is no hobbled ps4 port this is also the first time that ive had to deal with uplay itsannoying i guess to have a second client launch on top of steam but thats all i notice of it it doesnt crash it doesnt use up multiple gbs of ram it doesnt install adware and it didnt give me or my computer or my family aids i was expecting at least some of that based on what ive heard but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game a minor annoyance at worst for me so that was a of words and i might sound like im gushing but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it the 15 entry made it possible for me to play and i wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what youre getting into cant wait to put in even more hours,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,rainbow six siege is one if not the best fps game i ever played let me try to describe it for you rainbow six siege is a tactical shooter which its focus is completly in the multiplayer and competitive with just some tutorials that are done alone and can give you some renown these are called situations and there are 11 situations 10 are alone against bots and the last one called article 5 is cooperative against bots like a normal terrorist hunt bomb but with some story being it so the multiplayer where this game shines is composed for 2 groups of operators one being attackers and the other defenders every round you switch between them with your teammates rainbow six siege has 3 gamemodes avaliable right now which are bomb,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,since aug 2016 the game is more or less good before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters playing on eu servers at higher ranks gold iii iv plat i and above you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anticheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode and they toggled it on when they thought they see a cheater socalled white knights it happened so often on eu servers when youre winning for example with score 30 and then one guy in the opposite team decides scrw that they must be cheating they cant be this good so i gotta toggle on too and then onetap instahs with hipfire until the losing team wins that was a real plague so a lot of people stopped playing but its all now in the past thankfully its a huge fail for ubis that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anticheat but anyway now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore right now this game is one of the best if not the best tactical coop game pros since the game is more expensive than csgo not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience every round is unique theres a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy balance as of now there are no absolutely op operatives or strats everyone and everything is counterable every choice matters any hole any placed reinforcement any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy or get rekt trying theres always a chance to win even when you think its gg 1v5 clutch by legit player happens very often in this game neutral 1shot hs from any weapon instant death 1 melee hit instant death except caveira only 3 votes needed to kick unlike 4 in csgo cons ping it matters a lot and when you have 100120 and your enemy has like 40 then he has huge advantage netcode it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesnt count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire or when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it peekers advantage as a result of ping and netcode issues here is totally absolutely op bad servers sometimes you just cant connect to a friend or get disconnected from match its so frustrating bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are so you need a set of people to play with if you get kicked from ranked you will get banned anyway this game is great choice if youre tired of csgo too bad that there are still many issues present but fortunately ubi is working on it sounds strange that ubi is fixing things in own game cant believe but i see the difference with my own eyes recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends info and communication mean a lot here ashkicksasses,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,rainbow six siege its a great game and i have had a lot of fun playing it however i would recommend if you are thinking about buying it to have friends to play with as the game itself is far more enjoyable when you play with people you know and can easily chat to while playing it is a game focused on giving as much information to your teammates as possible and i find the communication can be lacking when playing with randoms pros many different operators with unique abilities to choose from battleye anticheat r6s is a highly tactical game wonderful graphics dlc doesnt limit anyone you can play dlc maps for free and unlock dlc operators with in game renown most skins only cost in game currency cons uplay ubisoft we got steam already your existence is pointless ping is a big issue ranked matches are not balanced 5 rounds per game is too short no singleplayer mode overall excellent game that combines everything a player looking for a highlevel shooting game,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,five gunmen one hostage six bodies mission complete fuse imagine theres this really cool fun game that is really great and youd totally play it everyday but everyone who could be potentially playing it is playing csgo and so you cant find a match for long periods of time and when you do its against players with 420 ping across the world so the game isnt really cool or fun when you can actually play it after waiting for so long that game is rainbow six siege,1,0
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,rainbow six is back with a new title and its only multiplayer but will you want to play it rainbow six siege the new game in the rainbow six series this game rose up from the ashes of what once was rainbow six patriots the game is set in current times where the fight against terrorism is full blown out terrorist are conducting massive attacks around the world and you play as either the terrorists or the rainbow unit which consists of worldwide response units as stated before the game has no story whatsoever the only thing you can do solo is a situation mode which teaches you the basics of the game and the incredibly fun terrorist hunt mode the game has one story mission which is online only which tasks you to go to a us college and defuse a toxic bomb the mission is notable because it obscures your vision with toxic gas and you need to work as a team to defuse the bombs cause the mission is really difficult the ai for solo mode is not stupid so you wont be able to rambo the entire map you will have to be smart with your actions since the ai is pretty smart they change up theyre routes and will try to flank you and rush you any chance they get theyre aim is pretty good as well now for the reason you might want to buy the game the pvp trust me when i say this the game is no joke this game is incredibly difficult and doesnt hold your hand you will need to work as a team if you want to win a well placed shot will take you out and a well planned attack might earn you a sweet victory the game suits many play styles from a support who helps out teammates in the field to a pyromaniac who likes to blow up everything in sight you will definitely find an operator that suits you the best even though theres not many maps each map is very dynamic its big enough for you to defend but no matter what remember you are never safe you can destroy almost every wall ceiling or floor so you never feel safe no matter how good your defenses are the game has one major flaw and thats the horrible servers the servers are way too unpredictable at one moment they work fine the other they wont give you any money or wont even load you to the game ubisoft stated that they are working on fixing this issue so i trust them to get it sorted out the game is optimised incredibly well it runs at 60 fps maxed out if you have a high end pc you will have no trouble running this game in the end do i recommend the game yes i do i do suggest at the very least waiting for the server issue to be fixed and you have one of the best squad based games ever made get a few friends for the ride and you have one incredible game on your hands final rating 910 a must own after servers are fixed if you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review for more reviews follow snorts review curator page here follow for regular updates on reviews for other games,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,100 reccomend this game by far the best shooter i have ever played single life short time to kill instantdeath headshots this game rewards the careful aimer and punishes the slightest mistakes harshly destructible environments mean you create your own tactical edges over your opponents and can attack each room a whole host of different ways favourite game out there and with the new anticheat finally kicking in i can happily write a good review,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,straying from previous titles in the acclaimed rainbow six saga tom clancys rainbow six siege sees the debut of storyless multiplayer missions in which players are tasked with a range of objectives from obtaining a vulnerable hostage to deactivating a volatile bomb it is this wide variety of game modes that allows players to experience a unique battle every match multiplayer is the key word for this game because you will gain nothing from siege if you are looking for a single player experience terrorist hunt features an offline lone wolf mode and the games situations comprise of ten single player missions but that is literally all there is situations are polished tutorials where the game will demonstrate certain mechanics with you needing to complete an objective against ai opponents judging these missions as tutorials they are actually very strong each one teaches something new lets you experiment with multiple operators and rather than forcing the player to press their way through explicit instructions it plays an intro cinematic and leaves you to your own devices levels in these situations are adjusted to not have as many options available to the player as in the full multiplayer game but at no point does it stop you or take control away from you in order to make its point the designers understand that mechanics are much easier to memorize through direct use instead of making the player read text which is a good thing because there are a lot of things to memorize siege at the time of this review features 13 multiplayer maps and 26 unique operators each of these operators has a special quality that makes them ideal for certain scenarios but this is when the game begins to reveal its depth for example kapkan is a russian defender his ability is to place laser tripwire explosives on windows and doors for balancing purposes they are very visible to the enemy as long as they are paying attention to each entrance this means that if you want to eliminate enemies with these charges youve got to try and get in their heads instead of hiding the lasers behind barricaded doors you can leave them visible encouraging the enemy to proceed down another path that you will lay in wait for you can place wires that slow them down in one path and your explosive trap down another that appears to be quicker for the enemy this mental game is something that seeps its way into every round of siege regardless of the operator or map from the planning phase to the final ten seconds its 5v5 structure is key to this because each team has so few players and no respawns it immediately puts the pressure on every operator to perform well every death in this game is significant death means less vantage points less fire power less intel and one less ability that could end up being very crucial to your success anything can happen at any second no matter the circumstances a team thats down by three points in ranked matches can still comeback a single player can kill five opponents a defensive plan that you meticulously crafted can be utterly destroyed in seconds that tension is something ive missed from modern shooters after planetside 2 was released and publicly humiliated any shooter bragging about playercounts i hoped that it would encourage developers to go back to experimenting with smaller tighter more focused designs thats been happening in the indie genre with games out of necessity but rainbow six siege is the first triple a game ive experienced to take this approach probably the biggest example of something that siege does that an indie studio simply does not have the budget for is the destructibility battlefield is the franchise that popularized this mechanic in shooters but since bad company 2 and failing to impress people with battlefield 3s microdestruction effects weve seen it be used more for spectacle than an actual mechanic siege takes that consistent and finetuned destruction from bad company 2 while successfully combining it with microdestruction on small maps every weapon can damage destructible walls and floors and the game is very consistent about what you can and cant destroy which allows players to properly use the destruction as a strategic tool defenders can reinforce walls to force the enemy down a path but the attacker thermite is capable of breaching these not allowing the defenders to forget about them its this depth and strategy that mitigates the relatively small number of maps theres also no level in this game that i would classify as bad which is very rare in a multiplayer focused title its expected for them to have a couple duds thankfully all of the important postrelease content is being released for free without the need for a season pass and not dividing up the community a trend that im glad to see is spreading im certain that this lack of paid dlc maps is what has led ubisoft to implementing microtransactions for certain skins and boosters thankfully the microtransactions are not required to enjoy the game optimization is much better than previous ubisoft games but thats really not something to be proud of considering the size of the maps and the small number of players and npcs in terrorist hunt populating them the game really should run smoother than it does on lower end machines for higher end pcs there are lot of options for people to adjust which is refreshing then theres the netcode it sucks the poor hitregistration is probably the greatest flaw its not rare to be killed behind solid cover headshots to go undetected and to watch your enemy paint the walls with their lost blood only to see they still have full health im not sure who or what is to blame for this problem but in a game where intense situations are frequent its infuriating to feel like you lost when you know for a fact that you shouldnt have i think what it makes these flaws even more frustrating is that for the most part the game avoids that nearly every lost round in siege is deserved and in turn so is every victory its this quality that makes the game so addicting and will keep you playing round after round long after you shouldve gone to sleep ive had matches in this game that left me with shaking hands and a pumping heart every 1v1 dual ends with both players exhaling their long held breath be warned that while i am an avid supporter of this game im aware its not for everyone tom clancys rainbow six siege is a stressful and downright punishing game it takes no prisoners one little mistake or overlook on your part can be the cause of your teams demise that kind of experience is not something every gamer desires but if youre like me and youve been waiting for squadbased shooter that pushes you and your friends to the edge demanding your full attention and rewarding you with victory that is truly earned grab your buddies and get ready to plan fortify and execute,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,ive got probably 300 hours in this game if you count both betas i will have many many more this is the game of the year for me competing with the witcher 3 in my personal opinion this is the only first person shooter that has been able to take my attention away from counterstrike in twelve years the potential for teamplay is amazing the mechanics are beautiful and solid the game is optimized beyond belief running at a constant 90120 fps on my outdated crappy system there is a character for almost every type of player this is not a casual game i have absolutely no complaints cheers edit people in comments kept asking for specs so im running amd fx 8320 with 8 gigs of ram radeon r9 280x 2048 mb gddr5 also worthy of note is that the first season pass includes nothing that isnt available to nonseason pass owners aside from cosmetics this is a huge compared to a lot of the season pass games weve seen of late,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,never had my heart beat so fast while playing video games than this 810 edit since my review came op as one of the most helpful ive decided to expand it with some details rainbow six siege is mainly about two teams fighting agaisnt each other in a fps counter terrorism world one team as the defenders terrorists other team as attackers counterterrorits the special thing about this game is the strategi and the destruction of the maps every game can feel very different because both teams has a fair amount of characters to choose from who all has one special abililty the destruction is a very big factor why i think the game is great it gives it a lot of replayability there are so many different ways to defend a point or even to attack one the teamplay and strategi is also important your team will have a way higher chance of winning if you all communicate and plan your attacks the singleplayer isnt as great as the other rainbow games there are basically two ways of playing singleplayer one is to play lonewolf in terrorist hunt terrorist hunt is your team or your self agaisnt ai the other way is to play situations which are premade lonewolf maps with ai there is no campaign the design of the game is really mlg as i would call it all the characters doesnt really look like counterterrorist units which isnt a bad thing it just kinda takes the imersion away otherwise the map is just trying to simulate the real world which it does nicely the graphics runs well on my computer with the highest settings the gun play and gameplay is close to perfect if you ask me its nothing like arma 3 but it has a very good feel to it and sometimes even so much that i feel like im a swat solider breaching into a building d there are sometimes where its kinda unrealistic but its nothing close to a problem the commuinity i have played with is nice they play toghter work togther and most importantly they communicate have had some games with people that didnt work togther at all but it doesnt ruin it nothing about the game it self i just want to add that ubisoft have made a lot of stuff like aac unity im very happy how this turned out since it was one of my childhood games but that doesnt mean that ubisoft are the good guys they still use uplay and many of their games are overpriced if you ask me thats mainly why i would say you shouldnt buy the game but the game is still a ton of fun and if you want it i truely recommend it now go read the top rated review insted of mine,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,a tactical shooter centered around either attacking or defending a structure may not sound unique or new but rainbow six siege really takes that idea and expands on it in amazing ways rss is a continuation of tom clancys rainbow six saga and the story is much of the same youd expect in a game like this but it does the job an international terror group is attempting to cause as much destruction as possible for reasons unknown and youre part of an elite counterterror team tasked with stopping them you can get your bearings with the tutorials and after that there are a number of singleplayer missions that expand on the games features both the tutorials and singleplayer missions are invaluable to learning the game and the various maps that youll encounter in multiplayer you can jump into multiplayer at anytime but its not advised to do that right off the bat the loadout available to you in multiplayer is based off of the operator you choose to play as unique characters unlocked with renown a form of game currency that you earn by completing the tutorials singleplayer missions or multiplayer matches and specific objectives and actions between the three of them there is a microtransaction alternative to renown points but worry not you earn more than enough renown points through regular gameplay each individual operator also has a special piece of equipment unique to them and theres enough variety to make them all useful in their own ways you can also play as the generic recruit character with access to default equipment as mentioned before rss is centered around defending or attacking a structure with the aim to disarm bombs rescue hostages or simply kill the opposing team however what makes rss special is the means and methods the game provides to you in order to carry out these objectives nearly everything in the games environment can be destroyed or damaged in some way creating endless tactical scenarios you can destroy the ceiling to swoop in on an enemy team trade fire between destructable walls breach doorways and destroy barricades obstructing your path deploy groundbased drones to suss out enemy positions the possibilities are endless on the flip side the defending team can set up a plethora of traps barricades and other obstructions to impede the other side all the while having access to various surveillance methods to keep a close eye on the goingons of their base the unique operator characters on either team make use of emp grenades sticky gas bombs deployable manned turrets heartbeat detectors and much more but remember slow and methodical is not how you want to play this game reminiscent of real life breaching tactics youre expected to be fast and decisive the environment is the true star of rss it can mean either life or death depending on how a team decides to use it and can be shaped to each individual players whims and that is what makes rss special absolutely recommended,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,hey look a wall seconds later hey look a hole on a wall this game contians massive amounts of black magic,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this game encourages mic communication so much that it will force enable your mic to always be on even if you have it disabled causing everyone in the game to hear whatever you say even if it was only meant for your friends over skype gg no privacy out of 10 this has been fixed kinda it still happens to other people on occasion this games servers are so powerful that they can manage to keep 10 players connected flawlessly with nexttono lag in an endless loading screen that pops up 80 of the time when joining a match unable to exit all you can do is open task manager on the plus side you can still talk to everyone while all of you chill in purgatory so essentially uplay made a group omeggle with the rare offchance of actually playing a game,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this is the best fps i have ever played from a gameplay standpoint but it will never be a serious competitive shooter in its current state efor competitive in my oppinion following needs to be changed or added add record function this game has no demo function this is needed in the esl to go after privat cheats remove clientside smoke and add serverside smokes are calculated clientside and everyone sees it different remove clientside debris debris from barricades is clientside and will ruin your game a couple times because you cant see an enemy but they see you fix netcode issues fix consistency the game randomly likes to have bugs that will ruin the game experience like blowing up a reinforced wall will only work 99 out of 100 times i have two accounts on diamond and used to play css in eps1div and i cant take this game serious competitive,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this is a long review from someone who has played the game since release reached high ranks in ranked mode gold ii and seen some turn to diamonds im reviewing siege in terms of its current state july 2016 also im too lazy to proof read so excuse any typosgrammar errors summary siege is an onlineonly game ive played this game since its release and i can definitely say i recommend this game to a certain audience simply this is a tactical shooter where patience truly is a virtue i can see how some players may find this frustrating compared to other popular fastpaced shooters but in my perspective i feel they are completely different genres using the same elements of game play for instance youll find yourself crouching 80 of the time to avoid detection and remain out of sight of the apposing team in my experience this is the best tactic to use when starting out which again may be frustrating for some now for the issues which i personally have come across and still exist note that there have been bug and minor gameplay fixes ie increased mutes jammer range people hiding in certain spots of the map which cannot be accessed on the other end issues hackers the obvious issues which ive come across while playing of course are the hackers the new anticheat system has potential and i encourage ubisoft to keep improving fairfight in some cases hackers are still getting away even when five players report suspicious behavior there have been times where the other team was cooperative enough to boot the player whos using hacks in ranked its much less likely to happen because the team you start with is the team you end with despite popular opinion ive found most of the player base nontoxic compared to its first release what ive noticed however are that majority of hackers are around the gold and beyond ranks of siege meaning casual and early points of ranked are relatively hackerfree fps drops on yacht one map maybe this is just me but for some reason im guessing due to the snowy environment my fps drops from 60 to 2530 in this map amd radeon 380 4gb vram 8gb ram 6core amd processor for the curious this seems to only happen on yacht but ive read that some have similar issues on other maps otherwise im running siege on almost highest settings available pricing i bought the game full price on its release and havent regretted it however i can see how intimidating it is for the general consumer being 70 cad for basically two game modes split into random objectives on both bomb secure and hostage this i believe is the biggest issue since ive come across the same players in the game over a span of days weeks and to my surprise months which im fine with but going somewhere with this the price pretty much lowers population of the siege community and i fear once the game gets a price drop siege will become irrelevant thus a dying community the starter edition which is gone now i think did help boost player base but ingame currencythe grind the starter edition is a massive grind let me explain im totally fine with the system siege has for unlocking weapon skins headgear and other aesthetics but i bought the regular edition meaning i dont get access to new and upcoming operators for free on their release where instead i must collect in game currency reknown to unlock them which is arguably fair regular operators in other words classes are easy and fast to buy new ops cost much much more unless you buy them with real money to skip aheadseason passgold editionetc 2k vs 25k each match typically rewards 200450 depending how well you did to put this into perspective ive only bought two of the four new operators in my 160 hrs of playtime although ill be fair to say i spent 20k on aesthetics but still 160 hrs and i havent unlocked all operators the good graphics amp sound beautiful and stunning its such a great success that the game gets little more challenging when im playing in a daytime vs nighttime map because it becomes hard to focus your sights indoor vs outdoor other than yacht ive had smooth performance in the game in almost max settings the game emphasizes on sound which really got me hooked on the game 910 gameplay very well done and is slowly improving as updates come maps are as destructible as possible meaning you can blast through walls barricades windows floors whathaveyou pretty much anything made of wood no mini map no kill streak garbage and the only info on your hud are bullet count available items to use and compass bugs have been fixed however some do linger and some operators obtained improved gadgetstraits for pvp given youre playing people with a similar skill set its very fun and intense youre more likely to win by communicating than staying silent ie rather than complaining about your death you instead notify your team of the position of the opposing players and what you think theyre planning even in death you can be useful by navigating cams pve terrorist hunt is also fun but i use that game mode to blow off steam in some cases can be challenging but again patience is a virtue dont run around i use some nice high quality headphones which help gameplay drastically you can sometimes hear enemies at the other side of a wall where you can shoot through if you have a cooperative team all the better guns are great however there are a small amount of op guns which need nerfing particularly guns new operators use 910 community despite popular opinion and not taking in hackers in consideration i like the siege community yes during its first months there had been much unnecessary talking and team killing dont get me wrong though im fine with people boasting about their wins however people look stupid after talking while playing on casual save it for ranked bud anyways when i play casual i try my best to give new players tips and ideas which mostly have respected and taken in consideration but i dont let the bad apples spoil the bunch the sense of community is a big deal to me in siege because of its cooperative aspect listen to teammates follow them if you arent sure what to do which i always remind people dont yell on your mic cause you ran in my line of fire therefore dont be a lastly sometimes ive come across teams which just dont want to communicate at all but thats just casual casual vs ranked really does feel like a different type of community 710 overall i like that ubisoft hasnt forgotten about this game and are at least doing somethings to improve it even since release ive been able to avoidignore issues which were first introduced in the game and still am because theyre manageable its super fun rewarding challenging realisticish and my favorite tactical shooter i recommend this game but not at its full price given the content and how likely you are to stick with the game be aware though that for a good experience youre hardware may need to be of some quality but this seems to be the standard for aaa games nowadays i give this game a confident 910 at a sale price,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,played it for 20 hours straight this free weekend and oh boy i never had so much fun this game is even more enjoyable with friends using voice chat planning the strategy your teammates even listen to you o you dont see that in many games but its a bit pricey atm would grab it when its on sale like 60 or above definitely one of the most enjoyable fps especially with friends 910,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,it was 1 on 1 i was scared he knew where i was and i knew where he was we waited for two whole minutes across the hall from one another while both teams watched i could feel sweat dripping down to my waist i put on my big boy pants amp took the stairs behind me my c4 was down there i went through the first floor came up on the other side blew up my c4 and slowly crouched walked into the room he was hiding in guarding the hall way i saw the man staring at his drone screen probably scouting the room i was in earlier i could have put a bullet in his head but i waited i grinned and filled his body with a whole magazine of lead,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i have played battlefield 2 3 4 i have played insurgency i have played far cry 1234 i have played counterstrike global offensive i have played various other shooters but this game this is just awesome imagine battlefield 3 and his brother battlefield 4 having a threesome with insurgency pregnant from 1 of the 2 but who cares dont ruin my story baby gets older gets kids with far cry 1 cheats with fc2fc3 and fc4 more kids all of them get kids with csgo one of those kids is a miracle its the tension of insurgency the fun of battlefield the beauty of far cry the tactical aspect of counterstrike and the teamplay of squad didnt mention that one who cheated with squad rainbow six siege worth every single penny and patience for updates regarding the matchmaking system which let us down several times sigh hey just buy it,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,the community on this game is amazing shoots teammate teammate says sorry mate that was my fault my movements when i was first playing this game i joined a multiplayer lobby not thinking about how i was going to play both teams asked if i was new to the game after finding out i was new they both said dont kill penguin were going to teach him how to play one of the enemys team tried killing me after everyone said they were going to help me he got teamkilled and they continued teach me the ways and after a long session i think i was better at the game and most of them added me on uplay i thanked them all and now i feel i owe this game a good review for gameplay and community,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,review for australian and new zealand regions,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i came from csgo looking for something to fill the gap in the games that i play this game is similar to csgo in the sense that its bomb hostage and so on but this game is so much more than cs the mechanics are awesome i love the fact danger comes from every angle through walls ceilings floors it keeps you on your toes more skill is involved it takes a little while to learn but if you have game sense youll do ok but the best part about it no 1000 skins no gambling its not just there to make money for a greedy company that cares only for the money it makes on skins rather than the game itself when this game is broken it gets fixed ubisoft dont release sound updates when major flaws exist in the game they ing fix them take blackbeard for example one of the new operators he has a shield it was op they fixed it however this game as a downside or maybe two the community is as it always is in competitive games toxic but you learn to live with it but what does really ing bug methe drm uplay its ing you have to exit the game and uplay to get friend requests to show on your profile and the lobbies often failim sure theyre working on that or atleast i hope they are this game is a massive plus in my collection i didnt like it at first because i was so blinded by csgo but now ive left csgo and started playing this i dont think ill go back,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this game is like anal hard in the beginning but you get a lot of pleasure once you get used to it its tough skillfocused smart and notable game if youre a fan of stories and setpieces rather than coop and competitive online play this really isnt the rainbow six youre looking for like cs r6s is all about deadly skills snap reactions strong map strategy and adaptability and when one mistake can leave you dead and out of the round you really has better pay attention and think before you move its sad that the campaign isnt that long but its teaches you the basics and each of them has their difficulties so you will need your sweet time and effort besides the campaign you got casual competive and terrorist hunt casual is just a 5vs5 casual match competive a 5 vs 5 competive match the matchmaking isnt perfect eg sitting in a team like this lv20 lv 69 lv89 100 and terrorist hunt is where you play with a 5 man team to play against bots its sounds easy but without real teamwork and strategy you are dead ripperino the grafics arent bad but here all the love and work has gone into the games destructible detail as gunfire and explosions tear great chunks out of stud walls and furniture and as breach charges shatter tough stone walls ectr i dont think there are a lot of games around that put that much details in it the community is overall positive most of the time you will get fun and polite teammates beware though there are always s i recommend buying this when its on sale thank you for taking your time to read this leaving a thumb up and a comment would be a great help,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,rainbow six siege has surprised me in many positive ways during its original announcement i was still recovering from the disappointment that was watchdogs and actually refused to buy ubisoft games for some time im a huge fan of the older vegas games both of which had a strong single player component so naturally i was even more disappointed when i heard that siege would be exclusively multiplayer little did i know that their multiplayer would be some of the most satisfying ive ever played siege has actually taken me away from my regular multiplayer shooter the largely popular csgo of which ive been playing since its beta i didnt even think that was possible but here i am playing siege for 2 months with less than 2 hours of csgo during that time the possibilities in siege are what make it so addictive it has destructibility on a more controlled scale than what you would see in the battlefield games you can break walls build barricades reinforce walls etc there are so many ways each round can play out and so many different tactics you can use to win the gunplay is highly satisfying as is expected from the rainbow six games which have set a very high standard from the vegas years rainbow six siege feels like the next gen shooter ive been waiting for its smooth elegant and tons of fun to play for hours on end,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,its like counter strike but instead of russians everyone is canadian 1010 sorry for getting in your way bro and getting teamkilled,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,still not too late to buy this game and have some great tacticool fun especially with that no mans sky refund edit 11252016 what pisses me off most is that during the autumn sale despite its poor reviews and horrid gameplay no mans sky is still more expensive than rainbow 6 siege and this game is getting a whole new year of free content are you fing kidding me,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,rainbow six siege is what happens when you mix the brilliance of the intimate counter strike matches with battlefield bad company 2s destructible environments it is excellent the most common and most played mode is a 5v5 match here you either start out scouting the whole building while playing as ct or setting up the defense as the terrorists some of the most tense moments i have ever had outside of horror games is when i wait for the counter terrorists to break in you hear thumping blasting footsteps and all you can do is wait as going out as a lone wolf out there wont be doing you much good as counter terrorists you are given drones in the start for scouting out the terrorists positions and it is actually tougher than it looks as you only know the last tagged position by the drones there are plenty of classes available in six siege all with different abilities you need in game currency called renowns to buy them the flow of them is good enough that it does not feel that the game is forcing you to buy them using real world money there are other modes like situations and terrorist hunt which help you get familiar with the various operators terrorist hunt in particular is excellent when played with friends against higher level of ai another thing i like is that you have to reach a specific level before you can enter ranked matches which makes you get ready for them rainbow six siege is one of the most brilliant fps ive played till now and if you like methodical slow tactical shooters you cant go wrong with rainbow six siege,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,tom clancys rainbow six siege honest review pros competative multiplayerbased combat fun yet challenging sideops completable challenges buyable operators customizable weaponry intriquite map design addicting cons some glitched lobbies soon to be fixed pregame lag probably just my pc about the operators players may buy operators that suit what they like to do with currency made by doing online and sideops some operators can place a mounted lmg and has perfect armor another can place a barricade that can only be blown up not shot or meleed all operators have very particular abilities none are remotely the same the teams you can play as either the terrorists or the counterterrorists with 5 on each team the police ill call of counterterrorists must breach and clear a selected building with the terrorists inside either rescuing a hostage securing some toxic or defusing a bomb you can place charges that will detonate and destroy only designated destroyable areas other gadgets come with the operaters the terrorists must fortify their position at once place heavy barriers on walls andor floors to prevent breaching also place either a mounted shield or barbed wire you select which one pregame other gadgets will come with the operators gameplaygraphics the game is like no other maybe a little bit payday 2 the textures of models and the gunfire feels realistic and fun feel free to bring down some settings to make it run faster as it still will look stunning the gunfire feels kind of crummy as your gun goes nuts when you pull the trigger which is a good thing this game plays like call of duty but has more lesscontrolled gunfire overall score 9510 a masterpiece by my standareds recommended purchase yes,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i bought the starter package for 15 this game is well worth the money yes you only get 2 operators in the beginning but honestly the operators arent too op a game can easily be won with superior tactics patience and aim definitely worth the 15 buy it,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this is probably the best multiplayer fps available right now its surprising to say that the devs behind a ubisoft published game actually seem to care about what they make and what the community thinks because theyve been fairly ontop of balancing issuefixing and releasing patches and content the game is 5v5 in one of three similar game modes where one team defends and one attacks each side gets access to a number of operators which are basically the games versions of classes each has a unique ability and particular weapons depending on their ctu the balancing is great with each class having direct and indirect counters each class has its role and while there are a few that can be ignored they can still prove worthwhile on some maps all the guns fill a niche and none are there purely for padding the same can be said for attachments destructability is the primary difference between this and other fpss the maps are all cqb and most of the combat happens through a woodenplaster medium there are distinctive destructable materials in the walls floors and ceilings and the key to this game is map knowledge because youll know exactly where to punch a hole to get a good sight line or where to blow up for easy entrance into a reinforced room you can have awful aim poor crosshair placement and generally just be bad but if you have map knowledge then youre halfway there to winning its a testament to really good level design more than anything there are problems though the netcode being the biggest i still run into issues of severe peekers advantage where an enemy can poke out kill me and pop back into hiding without me ever seeing them because ive died before the server sends me the information that theyre there to begin with rubberbanding happens frequently and sometimes searching for a game can take up to five minutes in ranked the lack of a singleplayer isnt a bad thing there are situations to ease you into the game which dont have overdramatic cutscenes pointless backstory and arent an extended tutorial they give you a set loadout and tell you to beat a mission this lets you get used to the operators the abilties the guns and the maps without any unnessecary fluff you can play this game solo although most people dont use microphones or communicate much at all but its playable and still fun even in ranked its better with friends though since information is the key to winning i bought the game for 15 as a starter edition but considering that it took me only 5 months to acquire nearly half the playtime i have in csgo which took 4 years id say the game is worth paying 60 for it also ruined cs for me by showing me what its like to play a tactical 5v5 shooter thats actually good i would say avoid the starter edition and just get the full game when it goes on sale once every three months for only fiver more than the starter edition though,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,first impressions a teammate shouts allahu akbar and chucks a c4 on the hostage and blows up the hostage doc then revives the hostage but smoke detonates gas on the hostage while screaming heil hit ler 1010 best match played so far,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,well made fun polished and balanced game but if ur looking to play competitively in its current state u will be disappointed the only problem this game has are the horrible servers hit detection is way off and sometimes u die from the position u were 2seconds ago i also have 80hours in betas and the servers felt better back then its very frustrating and happens very often wait for a netcode fix before u purchase this game update original post 6th of dec 2015 update post 6th of feb 2016 if u are looking to buy this game to mess around with youre friends in casual go ahead if ur looking to play a serious ranked game dont waste ur money on r6s hitboxs are still way off and the gunfights can only be taken seriously half of the time uncluding highest headshot rate of any game ive ever seen and im dmg on csgo match making is a joke and i still cant believe they allow players to bypass the level20 cap on ranked games if they duo with a friend continuous 4v5s due to there not being a reconnect function the ranked system itself is also very off i win 7 games in a row no rank up to lose the next 2 games in a row and i got derank wich led me to this review update review summary go back to csgo,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i put many hours into the beta and now into the full game and im loving every minute of it do not hesitate to buy this game overall fantastic gameplay it feels very smooth and plays very well never thought id be uttering these words but good job ubisoft also to those experiencing the steamubisoft issue heres a fix 1 copy the steam game folder tom clancys rainbow six siege located in cprogram filessteamsteamappscommontom clancys rainbow six siege and copy it somewhere for the time being 2 now go back and in steam right click on the game and delete local content this is why we made a copy 3 now place the folder back into the same location it was in and then go into the folder and open the exe and steam will pop up asking you to reinstall the game 4click okay and steam should say something along the lines of discovering existing files then your doing it right now after it is done click play and youre all set,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,its like counterstrike but fun you get to blow up walls doors and floors cool stuff theres some underpowered characters some overpowered ones that stupid rifle shield and its free peeks i swear to god but theyre working on it so thats good the whole free content for everyone approach is also great hard to believe its in a ubisoft game two issues it does suffer from are crappy netcode and the matchmaking sure im silver but that doesnt warrant placing a level 41 against a level 170 even if hes also silver if youre into competitive fpss this is a great tactical one if the starter edition comes up again dont even waste time pondering it and jump on the siege train great waste of 15 update they actually patched the game recently adding a little more content and most importantly fixing the underpowered and overpowered ops just like the community had been asking take that blackbeard you cheeky,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i normally dont write reviews for games but being an army infantry vet and an avid csgo player with 3k hours i can safely say this game is ing amazing its such a new breath of fresh air within fpss its got the graphics the gameplay is amazing learning to play from every agnle possible is part of the fun here hanging upside down in a window and shooting people is amazingly fun finding people in mm to breach and clear roomsholy it brought me back to my army days never have i felt such fun in a new game until now the guns have their limits but arent exactly the focus theres not really a huge balance issue with this game either most of the time when you die you just get out played every gun has their play style like shotguns you actually have to play close to walls or windows and not try to shoot medium to far range like to be able to take out enemies who like to peak from afar pick up a rifle like to run and gun well too bad go back to cod those who complain about the game are normally the cod players or silvers out of csgo who cant actually aim and need to find something to complain about this is by far one of my new favorite games,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,people compare this to csgo so ill do it but considering the reality r6s is better than csgo a lotbecause less mean people who whine every second not a single idiot who plays gay bar music in mic thats my favorite in r6s tho teamkillers and cheaters actually get banned itsepi is best dev you can choose what tactics and way you want to do it go in sneakly from above from below loudly rushing etc meanwhile in csgo you basically do the same every single map no edgy gambling children with like omgxdimthebest csgogarbagelotto com teammates wont judge you for using your favorite operator or weapon lord chanka free great updates often seasons are free completely you gotta pay for operators to have them but the same with normals anyway memes n stuff fooken lasersights tries to be realistic and succeeds kinda you got wallbangs what actually not bad in csgo you shoot through a wood thing and if you get killed by a wallbang you dont even know where it came from here shooting through walls floors whatever destroys or atleast making holes in them tons of destructibility etc could name them til night things that are better in csgo than in r6s better hitreg smoke granades are server synced better hitboxes kind of its stupid that if you get shot in your helmets ear protection you die cheaper cheaper means more hackers and morons tho less sized yeh around 14 gb thats better than like 40 or how much r6s is can run on crap pcs it has the same requirements as hl2 and even my old potato from 2003 can run it and thats it r6s is way better edit no degenerate spawnkillers in csgo a huge red dot to csgo for that,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this game 10 luck 20 skill 15 concentrated power of will 5 pleasure 50 pain 100 reason just to purchase this game,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,asked can you speak english he responded no problem 1110 great game and community not like csgo,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,this game is awesome really awesome but recently there has been a lot of problems with the comunity a lot of people on this review page say the comunity is nice and cool but heres the thing its changing for one thing the amount of teamkillers has increased dramatically especially if you play on casual one time i went into a match on bank on offensive and was imediatly killed by a guy i waited for someone to kill him cause well he was an ashole but nobody did and i realized they didnt because they were playing together like they knew eachother and aparrently they wanted to play alone people like this ruin the game and ubisoft needs to do something to properly punish players that do this also i have recently been encountering nice and friendly people less and less just more asholes there are three kinds of people i play with in this game mostly guys who dont have mics dont coordinate and dont comunicate with their team and get themselves killed first secondly there are asses who will coordinate with you but insult and criticize you for every mistake you make youll encounter these guys mainly on ranked they dont like inexperienced players and lastly the friendly people who are rare now they will help you give the needed call outs and back you up in a match and those are the best people in this game and even with everything i said its still not enough to not recomend this game just if you are gonna buy it try to find a clan or just some friends to play it with if you can cause the randomes are wild cards now thank you for taking the time to read this review and i hoped it helped you make your decision because this is one of the most tactical and team based multiplayer fpss of this decade and its an amazing accomplishment by ubisoft and i hope they make changes to help make the comunity of players more apreciative,1,1

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,been playing quite a bit and can honestly say the russian community is better than csgos 1010 would live in coexistence again,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,i sold my csgo knife to get this game and i havent played csgo since this is far more fun to play with or without friends i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fps games,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,another casual match me and this blackbeard 2v1 i have only 2 health left blackbeard asked permission to shoot my feet then revive to regain health i told him yes blackbeard pulls out 50cal pistol looked on that huge 50cal pistol realized that pistol would amputate my feet me oh sht wait bang blackbeard pistol symbol me anounncer one friendly operator left enemy comes out then kills the blackbeard 1010 would get shot by teamates when he tries to help you,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,most fun i have had with a first person shooter in years pros solid tactical gameplay you really have to choose your entry points carefully classes are all fun and exciting to play each has its own important role microtransactions arent intrusive as in they only are for weapon skins and a boost of renown which is easy to get in the first place maps always feel like a different experience every single time cause of the way the objective moves around each round and so it feels like multiple maps in one cons the netcode right now is a bit wonky but ubisoft is addressing this issue some people are jerks and teamkill but doesnt happen that often in fact its only happened to me once in 30 hours of gameplay killcams are also jacked up and show someone killing you differently from what you saw the open mic issue is annoying overall i would give this game about an 810 and is definitly worth your time,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,1110 best competetive gameplay best community you have to have a tactical thinking not just skills to outsmart the enemy and win,1,1
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,game is good pros well balanced tactical requires teamwork great mechanics cons uplay netcode bugs,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,as a kid i used to paint and collect warhammer i would imagine my warriors battle hoardes of orcs and chaos as i played against my brother and my friends great heroes and huge sprawling battles raged in my mind my brothers empire troops standing bravely against my vampire hoarde the only place i could actually see something akin to these battles was through the total war franchise with rome total war which we also used to play together ambushing his roman column with gaulic warriors i have waited twelve years for this pairing to come along even since i heard the announcements i have been eagerly waiting despite all of that pressure the game did not disappoint the battles that i dreamed of seeing as a kid are coming to life before my eyes i now live in the usa and my brother is still in england we are playing our cooperative campaign to recreate those same rivalries stories and memories that we would make with our models on our kitchen table as kids technology like this makes life better three thousand miles apart and yet thanks to this platform we can feel that same joy and excitement that we did back then 1010 would make more childhood dreams come true,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ill start with this ooooooh man is this game pretty ill follow up with this ooooooh man the game runs like a dream so yes i find it hard to describe the feeling of quality the game radiates everything just seem to have been worked on until its as they wanted it and nothing else the feeling i get is like the perfect mix between total war and heroes of might amp magic all the factions are different not only the units but they also have a faction specific feature like offices for empire raise dead for vampires and so on playing another faction really is another faction and not just recoloured units with changed names battles are tough the ai uses cavalry units so damn well i keep getting surrounded and hammered on which really have me watch how i do battle more carefully lords generals and heroes agents now have a very solid skill system much like a roleplaying game when they level up also heroes can actually be in the battle with you you really get the feeling that this is fantasy and that these people are something out of the ordinary as i said above its like the perfect union of total war and heroes of might amp magic,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,diplomacy actually works in this one as the empire i managed to a form a grand alliance between myself brettonia and the dwarves and everybody teamed up to cancel the apocalypse you can tell your allies where to put their armies and coordinate solid strategies to make sure everything goes down as planned probably the best total war game so far better even than shogun 2 since it doesnt have an infuriating realm divide mechanic nor does it have a max number of turns you keep going until somebody wins balance could probably be better the vampire counts can pull up so many units in a single turn that theyre basically unbeatable on the campaign map if you use them at all competently on the flipside every empire unit except stanks and demigryphs just cannot make its upkeep back compared to the other armies equivalent units i do wonder how theyre going to fit all the races in their appropriate places without massively redrawing the map but thats a bidge to cross when we come to it,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ok so after having played every faction and won on very hard or lengendary i have a lot of time not currently working my personal opinion is this is the best total war game made so far previously shogun 2 was my favorite ive read some of the negative reviews and i disagree with them for the following reasons 1 each factions play style is vastly different and more different than in any other total war game although i loved shogun 2 at the end of the day each faction you use the same units here not only is each factions units very different the way you accumulate resources is different orcs you have to sack a lot of cities and raid and you get bonus waargh armies if you fight a lot empire is a mix of cavalry artillery and magic vampire is mainly magic based dwarves has the best artillery but no cavs sucks when those stumpy legs have to chase enemies down at the end chaos you have roving mobile bases embedded into your army and you have to constantly sack and raze cities 2 gaming experience for each faction is very different chaos is the hardest as soon as you build your second horde the entire world wants to kill you you basically have to run and sack cities until you get strong enough empire is also very hard you get attacked constantly starting from about turn 35 from chaos and barbarian tribes dwarves and orcs are in similar starting positions and very sheltered so if you survive the beginning when everyones declaring war then its easy vampires are also easy because chaos and the barbarians ignore them until the end 3 the game is much harder than previous total war games ive read a lot of negative reviews where people complain that they get wiped out by chaos playing empire dude thats the point theyre out to wipe out the world i cant believe people cry about the game being too hard if it were too easy then people would complain it was too easy ai is much smarter now thank god we dont have the mess from rome 2 again its much harder to get the enemy army units to flee on harder difficulty settings again people have complained about this well then play easy ive tried easy and its like the other total war games the enemy breaks easily but if you play very hard or legendary then you have to fight a perfect battle to win if the odds are against you even slightly 4 quest battles each of the legendary lords have their own quests which if you win gives you an item although not important for winning for a faction it adds a new fun element to the game only downside to the game mechanics which i agree with some negative reviews is that the battles are too quick which means unless youre really winning you dont have time to zoom in and watch the cool units doing their thing but i think the battles were made shorter again to make it harder you have to micro fast to get units into the right position to win if watching cool graphics is your thing then play on easy allows for more time to watch the show this is a challenging game not everyones made out to be a general the ones who are not cry really a game where everyones out to kill you and you want a walk in the park instead go play on easy the easy setting is there for a reason so big thumbs up from me for the vastly different play styles of each faction which allows for replayability and the difficulty btw if youre amazed at how much time ive logged in this game its because i keep the game running even when im out shopping or in the other room watching movies youre welcome to read the comments section though to see how many aholes there are in this world though who feel like they need to judge and bully people the funny thing is most are gamers with a lot more games on their accounts than mine,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i want to start by saying that i have been a fan of warhammer since i was 8 years old and my stepdad brought over some lizardmen miniatures for me to play with while he wooed my mom i have collected several armies over the years played many games and given up hours upon hours to reading the novels looking at the lore and writing my own adventures in the old world and beyond this is and has been my favorite fantasy setting since i was a child no other world brings all of the greatest fantasy elements together ties them into an awesome renaissance era and then adds in death and despair and crackaddicted ratmen by the truckload quite like games workshop has with warhammer before you write the rest of this review off as the ramblings of a fanboy i want you to realize that this absolute love of warhammer has lead me to hold everything done with ip to the absolute highest standards i have played every video game that i can find with the warhammer logo and been grossly disappointed with all of them with the exception of vermintide which scratches a completely different itch since i was eight years old i have wanted a video game that let me control the emperors armies a game that let me see the old world in all of its beautiful deadly detail every new warhammer game ive seen has raised my hopes that this is the game that will let me do that this is the game that will bring the ridiculously overpriced tabeltop miniatures to life every new game has let me down until now mechanically this is one solid piece of clockwork the game is wonderfully optimized i run it with everything set to ultra and i have yet to see so much as a stutter in my 30 hours and i do not have a top of the line pc the graphics are great for a total war game and the special effects and monsters all look stunning campaign mechanics have been streamlined and simplified to make the empire building aspect of the total war series fun and less of a hassle no longer do you have to worry about food or sanitation fertility public order is now the only number the player must keep track of no longer do you have to look at a building and decide if the 12 public order is worth the 10 increase to your soldiers armor now buildings either let you recruit units or give you positive effects that isnt to say that it makes empire building easier just less of a chore you still need to plan out your building slots rather well as you only have a select few in each province new mechanics are brought into the campaign map as well and these are well done and add a nice new layer to the depth presented by the game one of these is corruption certain factions bring corruption to the lands this is generally done slowly and with little notice until it seems all at once that it hits you corruption brings about public order penalties to factions that dont use them as well as attrition for their armies this can be countered by certain buildings and heroes sieges have been revamped so now instead of attacking the entire city you only attack a single stretch of the walls while it makes the battles simpler it also allows for the ai to stand with the player on even footing and it makes the sieges more fun in rome 2 and attila i found myself autoresolving almost every single siege because of how lackluster and boring they were in twwarhammer i dont autoresolve sieges at all because they are fun and exciting its fantastic watching my units of orcs fight for supremecy on the dwarven walls speaking of heroes they are the replacer for agents on the campaign map they are exactly like the agents of old however they have a new ability and that is the action that lets them join an army when embedded into an army a hero fights on the battle map along with the army and they are awesome they look great and have awesome special abilities to boot lords replace the generals and are much better they stand alone but are tougher and more resilient than the generals units of past games they also collect followers weapons armor and gear that can all be equippied to them and the heroes of your choosing the ai is much smarter than previous total war games though thats not to say that it doesnt act stupid at times all too often have i requested peace from a faction just to be denied and then offered peace and a fat purse for accepting the offer a turn later it makes no sense on the battlefield the ai is a lot smarter as well able to use the new units just as well if not better than me at times speaking of the new unitswarhammer fits in perfect with total war most of the new creatures and units are incredibly detailed and bring about new facets to the battlefield flying units giant monsters and magic are all welcome editions to the age old total war formula and they fit in so well battlefields are so much more intense when there are steam tanks fighting dragons than they ever could be with romans fighting carthagenians thats not to say that battles got a lot more complicated either the special abilities of units like spearwalls for hoplites have been removed with spearmen bracing themselves against charges automatically if theyre standing still this is good because the special abilities that lords heroes wizards and magic items can be complicated enough when you have a lot of them and sometimes can turn into micromanaging hell while battles are still complex chaotic messes its at least manageable given all that is going on the five factions are all unique both on the campaign map and the battle map which adds a lot of replayability to the game ive read complaints that the endgame is repetitive because all factions have to beat chaos back to the wastes at the end but i dont really know what else they were expecting chaos has always been the big bad of the warhammer world so it makes sense that a finale would consist of beating them down hard all in all well done now for all of the praise this game still has its negatives but they are few and far between the biggest issue seems to be with balance some damage spells are extremely powerful able to wipe out hightier units with a single cast while most arent even worth their casting cost at all agent actions are also overpowered doing huge amounts of damage to entire armies while costing very little there are other things that bother me too when it comes to staying with the lore of the world the minor human nations have been extremely generalized receiving mostly reskinned empire units this is sad because these nations are important to the lore while i understand that theyre not nor will they be playable that doesnt mean that on the campaign map they shouldnt be fleshed out even a little i mean come on kislev doesnt even get the tsarina katerina as their leader instead they recieve a generic empire lord certain locations also dont receive the attention that they should certain empire cities are supposed to be works of art yet are just generic versions of each other dwarfen holds arent even close to how theyre described in the lore also factions are missing entire chunks of their rosters which im willing to bet will be added with dlc im not even upset about that because im used to gw practices of nickel and diming you so that was to be expected the game even has mod support something i never thought possible with gw involved the game isnt perfect but ca has worked very hard for a very long time to make it what it is and it is great you can immediately tell the amount of love that the game has been given and if more games were given this amount of attention to detail we would all live in a better place with better games 95 out of 10 great job creative assembly,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,usually i am too lazy to write reviews but right now i am slightly drunk and feel the sudden urge to express myself because of that and since the gloomy mixed on top of this page bothered me for some time now i decided to do something about that if you are not a fan of reading more than five sentences at a time better stop right now and just trust the big recommended atop this review or decide that i am not trustworthy and smash the dislike button i dont really care first off i played every total war game since rome and enjoyed most of them even the universally hated rome ii at least after a year of patches usually i kept to playing campaigns custom battles be it single or multiplayer never really tickled my fancy on the other hand i never really got into warhammer before thus i was skeptical at best when i heard about this game but yet i bought it shortly after release as a despereate attempt to get out of my postwitcher 3 depression surprisingly i was not dissatisified the biggest asset of this game in my opinion is the diversity of the playable races for one each faction has some unique mechanics which nicely blend in with the whole setting orcs accumulate fightiness to get free waaagharmies vampires can instantly summon whole armies from the dead etc secondly each faction focuses on different unit types far more extremely than in every previous total war game where i basically played all factions mostly the same for example dwarves feature a batch of armored units with big guns and heavy infantry but without any cavalry while vampires completely renounce ranged combat and instead rush hordes of zombies skeletons and monsters into the enemy then there is the addition of flying units and magic i initally feared that this would be impossible to bring into accordance with classical total war combat but the developers somehow managed to balance those features pretty well magic is useful but not overpowered flying units are dangerous if kept unchecked yet there are effective ways to defend against them so you basically get new possibilities to fight your battles without making traditional strategies obsolete still the game is definitely not flawless as you might have already guessed reading some of the other reviews the campaign ai is crappy as ever always trying to get a single win but never planning two steps ahead diplomacy has not seen much improvement either which is also mainly an ai problem alliances dont mean much non aggression pacts are broken with no repercussions suitable trade partners are hard to come by i nearly almost end up being at war with everyone furthermore many aspects of the campaign gameplay were simplified compared to previous total war games which is however not necesserily a bad thing being honest total war games were as far as i remember never really deep in terms of economy city building and politics so if you are looking especially for those features and dont care much about the real time battles this is probably not the right game for you at last a few words regarding all the dlc hate yup they are overpriced but they still sell therefore big greedy publishers like sega will continue this trend and ignore your pretty middle finger comments just dont buy them if you dont want to support that no one forces you or wait for a nice sale the base game is nonetheless worth it and occasionally there are some free goodies there are many more points i could get into positive ones lords heroes quest battles campaign map as well as negative ones no naval combat simplified battle maps unaccurate autoresolve but i have the feeling that i was getting too verbose already theres probably a reason i dont write reviews all in all i will now just conclude that this is definitely my favorite total war game so far and regarding the battles probably the most entertaining strategy game i know so if you read all this i am sorry if not didnt i tell you to go away with my fourth sentence,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is stephen stephens game crashed on startup stephen went to reddit total war twitter and read other reviews stephen found out that he could go into offline mode and this may fix the problem stephen fixed his problem and vanquished the enemies of the empire stephen did not run to the review page and leave a bad review for a problem stephen knows will be fixed very soon dont be a be like stephen edit here is my review for those complaining there isnt one here but before that i just want to say my initial review was to point out that devs are people they make mistakes there was a small issue causing this bug and that you should have waited it out before kneejerking it to the review page give people the benefit of the doubt before you condemn them especially after only a couple hours of release the issue i had was patched within hours of release now if the game was still unplayable i might march to a different tune but dont be so damn negative right off the bat people life is much easier if youre an optimist also if you gave the game a bad review for that issue but are now crushing little dwarfs with your trolls you might change your review now for my thoughts the game is amazing ive been playing total war games since 2005 and this is by far the best total war game to date in previous tw games youve played as humans obviously and while this is cool to be historically accurate what it meant was that all the playable factions were basically some variation of the other with differences in culture in twwh each faction is completely different the tactics you learned as the empire will not hold when fighting as the vampire plus each faction has their own campaign aspect the empire can appoint lords to offices that give bonuses the vamps have to have lands be corrupted before entering them otherwise they take attrition the dwarfs have a book of grudges that each grudge has to be settled and the greenskins have to maintain a level of fightiness within their armies or else they start infighting and take attrition what all this means is that when you start a new campaign it feels like a whole new game almost also the ui in this game is a massive improvement over rome ii and attila now you can understand what buildings you need where to get what gone are the days of going down the rabbit hole of the building browser trying to figure out what does what and how it will all play out the message system is sooo much better many times in the prev tw games youd start a turn and have to click through 45 pop up messages then there would be 10 more side ones to go through theyve boiled it down to whats important and overall i think have hit the right balance between complexity and depth and learnability after all this is nowhere as deep as like euiv or civ 5 but its similar i mean the point of this game is to get more armies to smash other armies now for the battles holy they are awesome the feeling of watching your demigryph knights slam into the back of an unsuspecting unit of little dwarfs and watching them fly through the air cannot properly be described in words where tw has sort of simplified the campaign they added complexity to the battlefield no more of the rock paper scissors formula of the old tw games where spears beat cav cav beat swords and swords beat spears now you have flying monstrous units trolls undead armies that can pop up from the ground gunnery infantry giant comets of magic that rain from the sky and hexes that curse your meni feel like some of the magic will need some balancing especially since magic damage does not scale with unit size but over all battles are awesome it definitely will take some time to master but it is so much fun trying to figure it out performance wise i think its great i got a gtx 970 w i76700k and while in the campaign get a smooth 90 fps on high and 5060 on ultra in battle usually 7580 on high and 4050 on ultra with few dips even if there are a ton of units ive only had one game crash but no big deal overall i give it a 910 if youre new to tw start here the prev tw games are much more complicated and sometime unnecessarily twwh struck the right balance and i definitely recommend it tldr best tw game yet all the races feels completely different the ui is waaay better battles are great challenging and loads of fun and the game is well optimized and runs good cheers,1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,creative assembly has gotten alot of flak for their dlc model down here but the truth of the matter is this is a review section to tell people how the game plays and how well it plays and if the initial game is worth the price point not a rant forum for problems people have with ca and segas dlc model q without any dlc does this game feel complete and polished and worth the 60 usd a yes in my opinion it does without any dlc i logged over 100 hours in this game and if you play every campaign available you will likely get a ton of in game time before you even approach needing dlc every single race plays differently in campaign they have unique areas of the map to deal with and unique challenges they all face most of them have totally different campaign mechanics to learn before you can really get a handle on that races playstyle it is without a doubt a complete game with the initial 4 playable races now if you want to complain that the dlc isnt worth the money is unpolished or incomplete that is a different thing altogether and would totally belong here but its all just complaining that they feel entitled to free stuff any time its added into a game but the truth is we as gamers and consumers are not even if making games is cas dream its still a business and to make more content to add to a game costs money people dont get college degrees to work for free gamers giving this game a bad review because of a company policy are doing this game an injustice the game is amazing in my opinion and very much worth the price point their complaints about dlc policy shouldnt be aired on a review of the game because this review section is for game reviews not a forum for complaints about a company please go to the creative assembly forums and let them know what you think there,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,when i first heard about a fantasy universe in a total war game i shook my head in disapproval i was stuck in the mindset that tw need its origins in realworld history and realism boy was i wrong the squalor food and aging is removed to give room for the fantasy to shine and it delivers you no longer have to worry about your mighty captainin this game lord becoming a victim of aging or falling in a surprise battle your legendary lords will always be thereif you can avoid a 5 turn assasination wound recovery and you never feel your progress getting lost or wasted its honestly great it means that you can put your entire heart and soul into becoming the mightiest lord without worrying about inevitable death needless to say that this fits a fantasy universe perfectly as a new feature your lord is now a single person instead of being part of a squad which works wonders you will no longer suffer from random unlucky deaths of your lord by simply being unlucky with who dies in his squad the single unit now works off of a pool of hp which eliminates that element of luck that haunted killing a captain in previous tw games as the game progresses and your lord earns levels through glorious combat he will get some unique questlines to fulfill in order to gain high tier loot such as powerful weapons and armor really satisfying and worthwhile to complete usually with a fun battleincluding cutscene to end it diplomacy is miles apart from all other tw games way better with ai that actually doesnt seem to be controlled by your dog and actively engages in diplomacy those were som quick thoughts 100 recommended as the best tw game so far,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,my family told me i had been spending too much time on my computer the past two days playing this game unfortunatley this meant i had to put them all to the torch as clearly their minds had been touched by the heretical influence of chaos the pure do not rest when the forces of evil bay at our door and there are deamons to slay for the emperor,1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,as the slayer king my first battle was against some green skins that were in the lands around my home and mountain stronghold of karazakarak victory came for me but at a hefty cost as i lost almost as many warriors as my enemy they retreated back to the shack made of rotten wood and rusted metal that they called a town while i stayed in my territory licking my wounds replenising my crippled army i reviewed the dwarvern emo diary aka the book of grudges to see what i could do to rally the hordes of crybaby dwarf citizens at my command i readied myself to take the orc settlement just a few more turns to gather my strength the next turn a goblin army from a neighbouring region charged at my armys flank ruining my plans why didnt i go back to safety of my stronghold i said chastising myself i was now being attacked by a healthy rested and eager goblin army baying for my blood meanwhile the orc army that i had defeated also joined the fray outnumbered almost 3 to 1 i started the battle positioning my troops at the crest of a hill having plenty of time to maneuver as the sheepish goblin army moved to join their wounded orc allies i waited a line of thunderers and another of quarrellers stood in line ready to shoot victory was unlikely but maybe i could pull off a miracle it was then that the miracle presented itself i noticed the orc warchief at the front of their lines severely wounded from our last encounter if i could just take him out the low morale of the orcs and goblins might shift in my favour the warchief entered my range and my quarrellers unleashed their crossbow bolts as he came even closer my thunderers opened up it was then that the warchief dropped dead his body riddled with crossbowbolts and shot it was as if the ancestors themselves smiled upon the bravery of my men and smote my enemies down for their hubris the remains of the orc army instantly routed charging from the field i turned the eagerness of my ranged infantry to the more pressing matter of the goblins goblin spearmen charged at my wounded men enveloping them in a sea of green slimey flesh and primitive spears they fought hard standing their ground and finally got the edge again when the slayer king himself jumped into the tide immediately flinging half a dozen tiny goblin bodies down the hill still i was heavily outnumbered desperate times call for desperate measures as my longbeards and slayers kept the goblins occupied i marched my ranged units down the hill towards their goblin shaman who sat toward the back of their ranks i opened fire with all the fury my men could muster wounding the fragile leader being on the outskirts of the mob the slayer king met with the shaman leader to leader as it turns out a goblin shaman is no match for the king of the slayers and soon he fell to his axe with their leaders gone the goblins began to fall in droves they soon realised that it was hopeless as the thunderers and quarrellers joined the fight supplementing their arsenal for the shield on their backs the rest of the goblins fled my men cut some of them down but alas it was a luxury that dwarves being much slower than goblins would not be able to take advantage of it didnt matter against the odds we had won with two of their leaders dead i felt satisfied that we had done enough damage for one day and i easily occupied their settlement replacing wood and rusted iron with stone and steel i nestled in my new settlement my men gaining much needed respite and reinforcements i crossed another whiney errand read grudge from my emo book of dark poetry assured in the knowledge that the dwarves wouldnt drown me in their tears at least not for another turn or two i love this game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ive just finished a 23 hour dwarf campaign before writing this review this review is targeted towards those familiar with other tw games for newer players let me just say that this game is a perfect starting point if you are looking to get into the series pros campaign i was always detracted from finishing long campaigns before it was often grindy and finishing was just a formality the restrictions to settling in this game actually help with this it allows you to interact with other factions as friendsfoes rather than future property of me i was skeptical with this change but it gave a refreshing amount of direction to my campaign that said i am still going to use the upcoming conquer the map mod but perhaps not all of the time the chaos event was fun in a way that wasnt also annoying im looking at you rome ii ia civil war combat combat is meaty cannons sound amazing lords smack away soldiers like sauron from lord of the rings unit design and animations utilize the fantasy setting very well map landscapes are varied and gorgeous in all i found myself using auto resolve less than my first campaigns in other titles ui and control is closest to attila difficulty there was an artifical difficulty on easynormal in the last titles where you would have hordes of onecity factions with an army or two complicating your movements in this game confederations are usually established by the midgame allowing much more epic fights with much more balanced enemies the easynormal difficulties have never been more accurate i have yet to test higher but ive watched heirofcarthage hardvh and legendoftotalwar legendary and i can say that challenge is alive in full force you can take a look at thier lps to be the judge depth generals and agents have a depth that was previously only achived with mods like ttt if you play chaos and want to field lots of armies you might choose to be a better leader for marauder units since you will have a lot of them if you play dwarves like me you can make your general better at setting up underground ambushes for all of those pesky orks this can only get better with expansions and mods the faction leader quests involve epic scripted battles that were tons of fun system i would be shocked if i had to wait over 10 seconds for an end turn in my first campaign most were 5 seconds i have an i54690 with the game loaded on an ssd with a gtx 970 i was able to run on ultra with only a few frames dropped here and there though not everyone plays with my system this is a pro since on the same system both rome ii and attila run much much worse cons towns towns have not have a lot of depth since empire maybe shogun 2 besides a few regions that have a special building chain to encourage you to think you will very quickly find the right buildings to build in your 6444 i think this was the intent i suggest a return to population and more ways to affect region wealth outside of buildings and building modifiers popluationtaxestradewealth made empire one of my favorites despite the awful combat and ai food and sanitation are gone i dont mourn thier passing but it does leave less to manage agents it is difficult to keep up with the ai in terms of agent levels in the early game on easy the ai was fielding lvl 11 agents while i had lvl 4 success against ai agents was in the range of 20 with an equal amount to injury enemy agents would succeed often and kill my own making it ever more diffucult to catch up deployment grants almost no exp a level every 8 turns or more it seems the game wants you to utilize army placement but even then i could not keep up i think the numbers just need a small revisiting to fix this issue you get agent spammed less but your agents feel about as useful in campaign action as in empire total war pretty bad i am happy this review is done because i really want to start another campaign this game is a must buy for tw veterans or fans of the warhammer ip as it fits with the gameplay so well tldr yes buy,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,im a simple man i play the game i enjoyed the game i upvote the game i would consider this the best total war game since their last masterpiece shogun 2,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,cavalry charges actually work again units have weight and factions have variety again a good return to form after rome ii and especially the factional blandness of attilla runs reasonably well comparable to rome 2 but dont expect to run it at ultra 60fps unless you have topend hardware and even then it may be iffy amd users supposedly should get better performance due to hardware based asynch compute when running in dx12 but as an nvidia user i cant confirm that loading times are a bit iffy but i wont say for sure as i am running a budget harddisk so it may simply be the system however if you were the type to play divide et impera mod for r2 it is much faster but thats more a comment on dei than tww conversely turn times are perhaps the fastest theyve been since mideval 2 and difficulty this is perhaps one of the most ball busting tws yet which some may find good others less so lastly mp i have no idea how the mp is because the servers are completely hammered right now because of launch but sadly from previews i can say it is more of r2 and attilla style mp than the avatar conquest of shogun there is a mod on the workshop that moves the secondary lord to a new faction of the same race and i highly reccomend it for coop play so you can both be the same race however edit no idea why but texture detail seems to have a massive framerate impact dialing it down from ultra to high made it so i could run at a decent 4050fps in battles with an aging gtx 760 probably the first time ive had texture detail severly effect framerate as opposed to just causing loading issues or ram issues edit 526 the game has been out 51 hours and ive logged 30 that should sum it up,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i read the hobbit as a freshman in highschool in 1979 i started playing advanced dampd later that year and dungeon mastered my first game on dec 31 1979 we played well into the morning and everyone crashed in chairs and couches after the sun had come up we didnt play any other than adampd until the mid to late 80s but when we did we tried them all paladium and all of their stuff from rifts to beyond the supernatural shadown run champions you name it we picked up warhammer fantasy roleplay and ate it up during that time we played a lot of games workshop stuff talisman heros quest battle master and of course warhammer fantasy battle games workshop always put out great stuff with awesome back stories that set the perfect atmosphere of each adventure when computers rolled around in the 90s we saw the potential and would fantasize about the possibilities of going to these places virtually and see all the places we had played for so many years we started in ultima online i stayed there way past their peak then ended up in wow for 7 years or so everyone wants to complain about the price of dlcs i paid 15 a month for wow for years and always thought it was worth the money now one of those games we used to play back in the day has come out total war warhammer has captured those awesome backstories and set that perfect atmosphere that great games always do the game is completely flexible to allow expansion and easily changed to make it what ever you think it should be add some units with a mod or pay for a dlc if you want but you dont have to i absolutely love this game and i want it to be successful i dont have any problem paying for dlc as long as they dont get too expensive so far so good i like what i see they have made an old gamer happy hopefully ill retire one day with the complete world at my fingertips and ride off into a magical sunset pretty scary thought anyway i do recomend this game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,leaving the historically correct settings was probably the best possible thing for the twseries this is the most enjoyable campaign ive ever played in a twgame and i have a hard time going back to the older games highly recommended,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,first campaign in this game hard difficulty i pick chaos with archaon as a legendary lord turn 2 i attack a town i make my army suicide itseft rushing straight into a trap i lose the campaign but archaon died so the end times will never happen 10 out of 10 would prevent the old world to enter the age of sigmar again,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,steam reviews are the youtube comments of reviews it is a cesspool of negativity just like yelp or any other public review forum straight off the bat i can tell you this is far and away a total war game that really drew me back into the fold with rts each faction plays in a completely different fashion from the other game mechanics are on point magic offers unique strands of strategy monsters and flying units just absolutely rehaul the game this negative press is mainly because of dlc which is upsetting most people have enjoyed the game and are using this recommendation system as a method in which to protest call of the beastmen easily offered me 20 hours of gameplay dont listen to the steam reviews if you want to know if youll enjoy a game go to youtube and gameplay videos of total war warhammer a few minutes of gameplay footage is more likely to help you determine whether or not a game will be up to your preferences than steam reviews,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,alright where to start first off this game is a fantastic addition to the total war series after the past few duds rome 2 and attila put out by ca since shogun 2 the races feel unique interesting and powerful in their own ways there are 4 base races to choose from empire men orks vampire counts and finally the dwarfs one improvement to the series is a more in depth character build system which truly makes your characters feel unique and special with the you being able to make your general a good fighter in their own right a good behind the scenes leader and caster or focus on campaign traits and use them to quell public order issues and lower vampiric or chaos corruption on top of this system is the quest chains for the legendary lords which provide them with some of their unique gear and weapons from the tt game this gear provides interesting benefits such as improved stats better abilities and sometimes allows your lord to access a lore of magic in the case of azhag the slaughterer in my opinion the graphics are definitely a step up from what they were in attila and the gameplay is fairly fluid although the ai will have some hiccups sometimes but this isnt a huge issue now should you feel absolutely obligated to buy the dlcs short answer no while the dlc adds extra options to the base game the base game itself has enough content to keep you occupied some complaints i have seen is that some of the dlc namely the campaign packs are a tad overpriced my opinion is that they are certainly above what i expected but not unreasonable in my eyes otherwise the dlcs released so far have been solid and did add some good stuff to the game look the way i see it the game is a gem this is certainly a big improvement over the last few total war games for former warhammer fantasy players this game even with the dlc is a steal compared to the price we have had to pay for miniatures in the past from games workshop i give this game a 1010 great base game with few complaints from me the dlcs are good but if you want to buy the campaign pack dlcs i would wait for a sale factions packs will probably be in the similar realm as what warriors of chaos is priced at 8 us if im not mistaken which i find to be a fair price even without a sale while blood and gore 299 us is behind a paywall so that ca could keep the games rating down to attract a larger audience,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,terrible dlc policy awesome game ill give it a thumbs up because i know the completeedition is going to be amazing,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,total war fantasy yes i bought all the dlc no half shouldnt be dlc yes i enjoy the out of this game regardless 910 update im lovin the elves,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,the game has the seal of of the elector counts i go for immersion when i play so for me the greatest feature is the ability to choose a race that fits your play style the best of the 5 races in the game ive played as 3 here are their stories dwarves they fight to reclaim lost lands when you use them you have to play defensively you drive the hordes of greenskins from your mountains and right the ancestral wrongs they are a slow campaign but honestly nobody ever looked at a dorf and thought this guy this guys on the track team god watching their stumpy march drives me crazy love their variety of artillery though and they have flamethrowers you can literally kill things with fire vampire counts total subjugation the vampire count armies have two flavors monsters and undead trash i went the undead trash route and threw endless armies of zombies at everything until their heroes fell under the weight of the dead its got a kind of shambling majesty when you watch 3000 zombies and skeletons just engulf a formation of shining brettonian knights you know theyre doomed but you kinda want to seem them put up a fight chaos fhoorr kaaosss my personal favorite no worrying about settlements no worrying about income no worrying about diplomacy you just run your angry armored ape train through every settlement in the old world they are awesomely terrifying because they seem so angry i have 2 complaints the first and most irksome is that the multiplayer is exceptionally bare bones and offers no ranking or matchmaking its a mess and a downgrade from previous total wars the generals lords have fixed skill trees that do not allow you customize the lord to complement your army a pity because the lords in this game are such engines of destruction paladins of buffing i feel this could have been easy to implement the lack of ranking also makes this a distasteful affair the other complaint is the lack of giblets and entrails not really a complaint when the blood and gore dlc comes out i better see people exploding into bloodmist and leaving bits and pieces everywhere or im telling khorne and hell f you up,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,very rare ill write a review but by far the best total war game since rome 1 imo havent personally came across any bugs and apart from the launch issues id only been trying for 5 minutes to get the game working before the hotfix came available its been a flawless experience a must have for any total war or warhammer fan edit so after 14 hours of gameplay ill go a little bit more indepth to try and help people make up their minds on the game with all the mixed reviews that are kicking about to start off with if you have a reasonably new pc you will have absolutely no issues at all running this game my cpu is a fx9370 and my gpu is a sapphire r9 380 4gig the campaign runs smooth at 1920x1080 with no stuttering whatsoever the transition to battles from the campaign map is a lot faster than previous total war games approx 30 seconds and then the actual battles run fine on ultra settings as well again running at 1920x1080 the only time i had to turn the graphics down to high was when me and 3 friends decided to play vs 4 ai on the largest unit sizes and everyone having a 20 stack 80x80 ive played both multiplayer battles and multiplayer coop campaign and have yet to experience any desync issues myself either which i know was a big issue on some of the previous games so far ive only had a quick play around with chaos and empire so cant really give any feedback on the orcs dwarfs or vampire counts chaos nice selection of units and also having to decide which god you want to worship giving different bonuses and penalties horde units so you dont technically have to upkeep towns except the embedded buildings in the army changed faction after i lost my units for taking a stupid battle so ill come back to chaos after more game time empire plenty of diversity within the faction roster so you can build your armies your own way although the game suggests that they are the 2nd easiest to play as at the start things are a bit chaotic to begin with surrounded by orcs dwarfs and rebellious empire factions that all want to wipe you out easy to manage your towns when you get to grip with the new set up hard difficulty is actually hard ive had to restart 45 times due to making silly errors and getting punished by surrounding factions lastly cons and pros imo pros smart ai when playing on hard and above havent tried on normal or easy if you declare war on an ai to your east expect opportunist rival factions surrounding you to declare war on you and try to grab land whilst your armies are nowhere to be seen graphics are amazing and the game is well optimized all factions are different and suit a different play style obviously ease to join friends games steam overlay actually works to invite and join friends cons as empire when you unlock a new unit eg you start off with spearmen and unlock spearmen with shields there isnt an option to upgrade the base unit to the upgraded like in previous total war games you have to dismantle your army and rerecruit the ugraded units not sure if this is intentional or a bug tutorial for non experience total war players can be a bit underwelming doesnt really go in to a lot of detail when it comes to hero skills and town management bretonnian units and bases are in the game but arent a playable faction at the moment on the campaign map ye ok im a bretonnian fanboy if your new to total war games start off by playing on easy or normal if your experience with total war games get the difficulty cranked up and have fun hope this helps,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,after the launch debacle that was rome 2 total war i swore that i would never pre order or maybe even buy a total war again now here i am after playing over 150 hours of total war warhammer and i think it is worth every penny yes i get it the dlc policy is kinda overpriced and maybe some of those things should have been in the main game from the start but really in my opinion this is the best total war so far and i can only say i can recommend anyone that loves rts games or maybe u just like fantasy there are moments in battle where i get that lord of the rings movie feel and that is prolly the best compliment i can give the game finally the last thing i want to add is that this game will become way bigger then it is now in terms of content many cool dlc and flc free downloadable content is being added on a 2 month basis or so i love this game and i am sure within 2 years i will have more then 1000 hours played,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is the best total war ever created units and building have distinct purposes like in shogun 2 no more choosing between 15 varieties of the same and looking through dozens of small buffs and debuffs it is as hectic as atilla and it has hordes it has a theme which is as great as rome lets forget rome 2 ever existed combat makes sense like in medieval 2 before the synced animations were introduced i wish i could say something about empire maybe when naval battles come for the first time factions play very different from each other and it runs well and diplomacy makes sense kinda most of the time anyway finally ca after few years of experimentation and blunders you made a game that is awesome as a complete package,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,expensive yes a unique authentic and epic warhammer experience yes almost endless replay value made even more so with monthly updates for years to come yes a dev team who listens and communicates with the community yes if you have the cash this game is highly recommended theres no strategy game turnbased and realtime that can give you the epic experience of wth the dlc do add up but they are added to the campaign whether or not you purchase them you just cant play as them,1,1

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i have played every total war game that has been released so far unfortuntely the last tw game that i was satisfied with was rome total war the first one empire total war felt like a prototype rather than an actual game suffering from some nasty bugs silly ai much more silly than normal and horrible performance optimisation shogun tw was decent yet limited in scope and play its main flaw was limited replay value shogun 2 was popular and score a lot of points with the fanbase but i absoloutely hated its cheating blatant ai which was more apparent this time round and enemy agent spams something that warhammer suffers from at the moment sadly rome 2 total war had to be one of the franchises biggest launch disappointments a lot of the issues got fixed by the time empire edition came around but by then it was too late rome 2 has a bad interface terrible politic mechanics and mundane boring micromanagement features such as the leveling up of your leaders which ended up becoming less of a chore in warhammer the total war series has been on a losing streak since rome total war trying to recapture the magic that the iconic rtw is known for until now warhammer total war has finally taken the mantle as the best total war game since rome and sits loftly on its throne goading and chiding all its previous titles like an angry thorgrim grudgebearer reading through his grudgebook thankfully the reputation for the total war series has been salvaged one less grudge to be concerned about warhammer is not only a solid release minus the few remaining bugs but its also has solid performance and a solid stable multiplayer that ive been enjoying far too much right away its easy to see that creative assembly have poured their hearts and souls into this title they clearly love the warhammer universe and have done it great justice as a fan of warhammer its lore and a current active gm for warhammer fantasy roleplay i would be the first to jump down their throats if they messed up this title as its very close to the heart and its good to know that they have done it justice now some minor gripes do remain mostly lore ones the colours of most of the state troops are wrong for the various empire provinces as are the appearance of some of the elector counts im looking at you boris todbringer yet these are just a drop in the ocean and issues like these can be readily fixed by mods and such leveling up skills of your leaders was a complete chore in rome 2 uninteresting annoyingly mundane and full of micromanagement however in warhammer total war all that has changed you still level up your heroes and leaders but the skill tree interface rather than smacking you in the face and shoving it in the mud like the previous total war game here it treats you kindly and you know what your looking at not only that but the skill trees and the tech trees are done really well full of detail and surprisingly full of content with each skill tree becoming different depending on the hero rome 2s dull micromanagement system and its awful attempt at politics is all done away with for a much more favoured approach of retaining depth and complexity yet keeping it simple to use from the interface to the way everything just feels right tw warhammer certainly earns its place as the top franchise title my only regret is that they didnt call it total warhammer sigh this game also has the most potential of any other previous title as there is so much they can do to not only improve the game but also to expand upon it with two huge new standalone urgh standalone expansions on the way and dlc and flc on the way for the first title this is an exciting time to be a warhammer fan,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,despite all the dlc policy hate the game itself is good,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,pros i havent felt this immersed since the earlier tw games very polished release and well optimised for a tw game atleast cant wait for dx12 patch varied and fast pace battles introduction of magic flying and monsters has really shaken things up amazing sound design soundtrack and sfx all round great campaign experience with lots of cool events and things to do cons cant rename my vampire general to cck blockula in multiplayer campaign,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,gt played empire gt hired general renamed him heinz guderian gt built army consisting of him and only steam tanks gt invaded and conquered france brettonia watched courlonne burn under the weight of my fantasy german steam tanks 1940 game is all reich,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,warhammer fan why are you reading this go play the game already is the game good for everyone else yes its a solid game imho but bear in mind that my opinion is biased since im a huge fan of both total war and warhammer technical and grapics,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,before anything else i should say that i have been a total war fan since shogun i and i have played every single total war with the exception of attila total war warhammer is the most fun ive had playing a total war game by far since release 3 weeks ago ive put aver 100 hours into the game and have finished the dwarf orc and empire campaigns before this i could probably count on one hand the number of times i finished a total war campaign the factions in previous total war games mostly felt the same so you would play one or two factions and have a pretty good idea of how the others played in this game all factions have totally unique units and play styles when i first heard that the game was announced i was skeptical im a big history nerd and while im a fan of some fantasy i was not really into warhammer at all but creative assembly proved me wrong total war and warhammer were made for eachother the fantasy setting makes things seem so much more epic and the dread and constant warfare of warhammer is a perfect setting for a total war game when i saw my stout little dwarfs go up against barbarous orcs and huge monsters i felt like there is a much more desperate life or death feel to the combat kinda like im the romans holding back barbarians from taking over civilization except i think being ruled by huns would be much more preferable then being eaten by an orc i also love the hero system you really grow attached to your heroes and your armies whereas before each general in total war more or less felt the same i encountered no technical issues and the game ran surprisingly smooth at launch unlike alot of other total war titles the ai which is a weak part of almost all total war games may be the best that its ever been now for the cons players need to be able to choose where to deploy their reinforcements on the battle map i had a few battles where my reinforcing army and the enemy reinforcements deployed at the same spot which led to a huge disorganized battle breaking out on the edge of the map this turned what should have been an easy victory into a decisive defeat also the ai spends too much emphasis on agent actions which leads to ai agents that are way too powerful by end game while the ai agents are way too powerful the composition of end game ai armies is mostly made up of low quality early game units the result is that dealing with ai agents is extremely difficult but player armies become steam rollers by end game anyway good job creative assembly rome ii and empire really kind of turned me off from buying total war games at launch but you won my confidence back,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,the good fantasy setting for total war equal to shogun 2 and with time it might surpass every update so far has made the game run smoother for me fractions well done magic system well put together monsters giants dragons trolls the bad the dlc policy ai can be very bad for decent variety of units mod needed radius recomended only chaos undivided so far grand father nurgle demmands respect no skaven i want my rat hordes 910 where are the rat ninjas,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,so far i really like it they stripped down the tech and social trees to stream line the battles there are quests to get geared up and equipable and swappable retainers the whole thing seems way more like a battle intensive rpg set in the total war engine which is why i bought it the graphics look great with diverse little toons amongst the units they yell they fight they die they get swept through the air and rag dolled by trolls you can even cast magic and watch them all fry like pork sausages the game itself runs good too i have currently played 3 hours over a remote connection with no issues there was a point on the very first splash screen where i waited for about 10 minutes before the intro started i thought it was broken but it started eventually i dont know if multiplayer is working for anyone else but it crashed my game the two times i clicked multiplayer so thats definitly a bad mark for the game right now if you wanted to play this game for the multiplayer hold off till they fix it fixed now many people have said that it black screens or constantly crashes on them i havent experienced that yet outside of attempting multiplayer this game runs on my low end bare bones laptop that im remoted into from a crapy dell i give it two thumbs up for optimization now all i want is an army painter so the warhammer theme would be complete,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,after 133 hours completing legendary greenskin and one week later im on the verge of breaking up with my 2 girlfriends losing my job and getting reported for a missing person this is my first ever steam game review i have been playing total war since shogun 1 i had great time playing rome 1 and shogun 2 im also a huge fan of warhammer since the days of dark omen i was excited when i got to know about this game just 6 months ago hated the fact that they had day 1 dlc every time i play a game on launch day i expect minor hiccups this game gave me black screen for the opening cinematic because i was using nvidia card this has been fixed with the games hotfix and now game runs fine there were 3 crashes over 133 hours of game play when i tried to swap units between armies it was annoying then i realized one crash every two days for a week old game is not a huge issue at least it was not like rome 2 which was well u know what i like about this game is that all the units from different races are not reskins of each other unlike shogun 2 all the units of different races has their own stats and attributes i learned this the hard way when my armies which gave me decisive victories towards one race suffered crushing defeats at the hands of another race i could not mop the whole map with the same army composition however it could be the legendary setting since we suffer a huge penalty and the ai gains huge advantages even the slightest difference causes major set backs i was forced to go indepth in understanding each races units before creating a spesific army for each of them the economy of races are also done differently which is a cool thing what i didnt like is the multiplayer it is bare bones the set up for multiplayer game feels like it is from the 90s they could learn a lot more from shogun 2 where they had clans conquest map smart auto matchmaking and the coolest of all is creating your own avatar and equipping him with gears which drop after a battle is done each item has its own stats and completing a particular set would give extra stats i had expected this from day 1 for warhammer since they had it in shogun 2 what surprised me is that the ai seems to be quite smart i had to fight a battle since i got outmanevoured by the ai ai had a huge army with weak warboss orcs general while i had a battered army with experienced warboss i had thought that i could try to win this battle by killing the ais warboss with mine and the rest of his army would rout when the battle started that warboss did something no greenskin had done he stayed way back and did not engage me in melee that cupking coward my army was wiped out my warboss dead and his gear looted what didnt matter to me is the graphics im running on a budget cardwhile the graphics arent top notch but still it looked good when i zoomed in using the cinematic mode when you have to fight and command your army on the battlefield things like units details or grass details becomes negligible i switched to cinematic mode two times on battles that i knew i would definately win i wish that i had a high end gpu so i could watch the units in action bottomline this is a fantasy total war there is no history to follow other than from the lore of warhammer there is no tetsudo formation and such however units with shields automatically raise up their shields under missle fire this blocks 30 of incoming fire for orcs boyz while the goblins having smaller body and could cover their limbs better could block 50 of missle fires provided that they are facing the correct direction i think this automation is convinient and done in part so there would be less micomanagement due to the fact that our attention would be shifted to focus on casting magic and activating magical hero gears i believe only players who like both total war and warhammer lore would truly enjoy this game im not sure if i should make amends with my girlfriends or start a dwarf legendary campaign,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is no indepth review by any means given ive only played it for 13 hours now but i must say what a beautiful amp refreshing game we got here dont get me wrong it has its cons but nothing compared to all the goodnesspotential it brings runs smooth launch looks amazing factions with truly unique gameplay stylesabilititiescharactersperkstraits etc epic maps dlc coming soon dlc coming soon characters can be too much as in op only 5 playable factions would i recommend it yes would i do it allover again given what i know now absolutely update 3 campaigns 50 hours later im still in love,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,total war warhammer reviews before dlc very postive total war warhammer reviews after dlc mixed what im shocked this game is everything that i ever wanted in the total war series franchise the game itself is a great happy marriage between total war and warhammer ips it is such a shame that people are coming out hating the game based on the fact that it has dlc in my opinion the base game is worth it for the price it currently is the dlc is well thought out and created with passion ill happily purchase it because the ip is just so great on both sides creative assembly took the warhammer fantasy world and recreated in their vision in such an amazing way for someone that has been following the warhammer franchise and own a couple tabletop armies which sadly i dont play anymore i just can not say anything negative to creative assembly about this particular title i wish more people reviewed for the base game opposed to the dlc and expressing their opinion specifically about the game itself not pitch forks about greedy devs creative assembly has always shown that they want to satisfy their clients and have always stated that this game would have dlc nobody complained about it then why now,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,game didnt work posted not recommended review hour later got a reply from devs and fixed it deleted review and posting this one for your assistance and the great game 1010,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,im not going to recommend this game because it has problems running on my toaster 01 hours on record user reviews was a mistake,1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,last time i had so much fun with total war was medieval 2,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,played as empire archaon spawned alt tab out to google the end times alt tab back to game to realise that everyone will die game crashes 1310 immersion,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this game is amazing the graphics sounds landscapes armies and modelsall stellar the reviews are accurate this is the best total war game ever and probably the best warhammer game ever this and dow3 will make this an amazing year for games workshop themed video games,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i think it is very easy with the steam review system to recieve an incomplete understanding of how good a game is or isnt with just a thumbs up or down it is hard for anyone to tell you much about a game so i would like to break this game down as much as possible to give you are really good source for information firstly lets address the negative reviews that state the game is great i had a lot of fun but dlc these reviews are not reviewing the game ignore them immediatly there are problems with this game but dlc is an option the problem would only be if the game did not have enough content to begin with so lets look at that what do you get in the base game the base game gives you 4 races empire vampire counts dwarfs and greenskins the map that you are playing on is set in the old world of the warhammer universe by default all races have 2 legendary lords however through the free updates some have gotten more each campaign can take anywhere from 40 to 70 hours to complete if you consider 1 dollar an hour a pretty good investment this game oozes good value however if it is that would not matter alright so gameplay this section has to be split into two sections campaign and battle starting with campaign this side of the map is a perfect example of 10 steps forward 2 steps back campaign pros all campaigns feel really different diplomacy is easy to use and understand stances are all useful and feel intuitive visuals are beautiful cities changing to match faction is an amazing addition economy is limited forcing players to actually make desicions when building armies campaign cons regional occupation the concept that only certain races can occupy certain cities terrible idea movement in your land is same speed as enemy causing annoying chases through your land though cities due change when upgraded it is very hard to see the difference unlike attila or rome 2 onto battles the battles stay mainly the same from previous games with the addition of crazy new units to spice it up the ai is also much improved you can tell a ton of work went into making these great however the games keep pushing towards smaller maps and faster battles which may have gone a little to far in this one battle pros ai it can actually put up a good fight diversity magic visuals custimizable ui bound to space bar nice additions to control make it easy to move army impacts are greatly improved battle cons no blood maybe im just messed up lack of kill animations understand the point of removing the match combat of older games however a system like dawn of war where when they go to kill an enemy it plays a combat animation would have been nice maps are very small battles are very short 5 minutes 8 minutes lastly we need to discuss seiges and the lack of battle diversity in terms of types total war warhammer features two battle types seige and land battles no minor settlement battles no fort battles and no naval battles not so salty about the last seige pros the first few feel epic art is beautiful seige cons single or double wall leaves zero strategy entire battle is spent watching your troops slowly try to break past theirs infinite tower range makes artillery useless only feels like there are 5 different maps different factions have the same settlements with different art dwarfs are the most dissapointing as if you want their trailer it shows multi tiered setlements in conclussion total war warhammer improves on much and gives you a ton of value for the money you are spending even without mods or dlc some of the issues i have mentioned can be fixed with mods with the game all moded out like mine is the only issue i still see are that seige battles are dull and lack strategy other than that this game is amazing and if you love tw like i do this is a breath of fresh air into a very old franchise,1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,great graphics great performance playable even on my very old pc at medium no boring typical tw game great battles great strategy great character lvling great etc simply the best game of many years and will be with its expansions for many more years i recommend it 100 in all my pro gaming honor and super fun just turn off the antivirus completely when playing this game and it wont lag at all but turn antivirs off completely and restart the pc if the antivirus needs this to be turned off but remember to turn it on when not playing i did that and it doesnt lag on medium it runs great this is total warhammer sparta epicness also formation abilities are already in the game in passive form for example charge defence vs all etc and this is so well thought cause its no longer a pike wall spam fest for example also units themselves have active abilities also this is important after making a group for example ctrl4 then u select that group so all units are selected and press ctrlg it saves the unit formation and enables group attack which is like the amove in rts u select when u want the group and click it to attack an enemy unit and the units of the crtlg group will target different enemy squads which are close to the target of course the targets arent always the most optimal so u can select those units which dont have the best target and manually set target but this saves a lot of time and like that u dont have to press pause all the time to manually set targets fr each unit of your army the multiplayer is great intelligent strategic plain and simple,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i wasnt too keen on the idea of a fictional world in total war but having played it i think its one of the best total war games i have played i do think people who only plays for the campaign side of things like me would have wanted more playable factions in the campaign but overall i am satisfied 57,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,wow finally a total war game thats bug free runs smooth looks good accurate to its source epic lol well done sega yeah still f you gw for your miniature prices xd peace,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,havent been this hooked to a tw game since medieval 2,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,by far the best fantasy warfare simulation ever made,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,issues relating to dlc and pricing aside this total war game is immensely fun ca has merged the warhammer lorecontent well into the game warhammer fantasy was always a natural fit for the total war series but forking out 80 bucks for the base game plus the chaos dlc is pushing it and i tend to agree with users view on the dlc issue that initial 80 bucks alone should have me covered for a lot more content than what i got notwithstanding the dlc pricing and other issues i would recommend,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i havent enjoyed a total war game like this since medieval 2 im not familiar with the warhammer universe but its not the fantasy setting its the gameplay the beautiful graphics attention to detail and battle mechanics that i like the factions look and play so differently from one another its great and the most celebrated change for me is the unit 1 on 1 battle or the lack of it no more individual units locking into a dance with each other finally though i tremendously enjoy playing this game im a historic total war fan so i hope that after this theyll do medieval 3 with the same quality and love total war warhammer trading cards artnbsp,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,man are these some troll reviews this is the best total war game ever warts and all i havent bought the blood dlc i dont think its worth 3 bucks i havent bought beastmen either that sure as hell isnt worth 19 would i tank the game reviews with a negative because im not happy with them hell no ive already not bought them i speak with my wallet people who did can speak with their reviews of the actual products theyre unhappy with this is not a game of copypaste infantry and cavalry to alter slightly between near identical factions some tw games are completely comprised of such near identical factions others have two or three significant variations that comprise all or most of their lineups being actually unique from others the four base factions are epic utterly different units from start to finish combat is a blast it would be even without magic and monstrous flyers i have plenty of complaints about the game i think city design has been overly simplified agent behavior is terrible as usual and the battlemaps are also hugely simplified boring affairs compared to what they used to be the game is still great though theres no excuse for giving it a negative because you dont like the dlc the dlc have their own reviews use them this is supposed to be here to help people decide to buy a game by getting relevant useful information they can see how much the horribly received dlc costs without s review bombing it out of existence,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,how do i describe it its at the same level shogun 2 was when it came out a step up from its predecessors and a step behind what we had hoped for this game needs to be good and needs to be well received i believe for the total war franchise to continue on proconnerus im happy the ai doesnt derp its way into sieges but the cities are simpler so it feels like a bit of a trade off especially with autoladders though its realistically the only solution to the ais general sad panda face at the prospect of going up walls the ai seems to be able to competently handle its new unit types i was particularly impressed with chaoss use of marauder cav and tundra wolves for skirmishing however the ai also seems to favour the if we engaged in a line today were certainly going to engage in a line tomorrow theres quite alot of love thats gone into the character models from what ive seen the art work is certainly on point though who ever thought thorgrims angrylazyboychair3000 was a going solution is a bit well daft i havent seemed to inherit many of the technical issues people are going on about right now the con part of it is that theres a huge torm over the technical soudness and optimisation of this game business as usual for tw p conconnerus dont touch multiplayer in early days right now its broken af though i suspect server load and glorious comrade australian internet is to blame no rpg style shogun 2 general avatar for multiplayer game was basically made for that style of multiplayer and would have shined with it all in all this game is worth the dollars my hip pocket regret hasnt burned through my trousers so thats a good thing but if you want to hold off then i heard theres a nice steam sale something something something,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,total war warhammer is a turnbased strategy game with realtime tactical battles set in the warhammer fantasy battles universe what is great about this game the realtime tactical battles are beautiful and terribly satisfying to play while the onemoreturn compulsion of the turnbased strategic game is as strong as in any total war game in recent memory giving the units more active abilities while slightly microheavy makes the tactical battles much more engrossing and compelling there is more a sense of you needing to be there to act rather than just watching the armies fight each other the new customization and upgrade options for your lords and heroes add an almost rpglike element to the game that is fantastic heroes agents from previous total war games can now integrate into your army and fight as a unit alongside your regular army the fantasy warhammer setting allows for the developers to free themselves somewhat from the binds of historical fact the steam workshop modding support provides key customization options to make the game play as you want it to without issue the warhammer universe is an excellent backdrop for a total war game and they come together brilliantly the game was so impactful on me that i went out and bought my first gw miniature mannfred von carstein what is good about this game there is a game that the developers could make derived from this game where you build up a party of only a few heroes and go through the countryside taking on and defeating standard total war 20 unit armies i would buy that game and play a lot of that game that isnt really important to the review of this game except to say that that is how good the new lord and hero rpg elements are good use of steam features including cloud saves trading cards etc what could be improved in this game the new hero and lord abilities while great can be a little micromanagement heavy as you will spend a significant time in the battles especially in large battles just searching for the next herolord ability to pop if a few more of them had been passive abilities especially for heavy magic users that probably wouldnt have been a terrible thing the city management options are quite sparse and relatively uninteresting other than a main couple of core provinces that produce units most of your additional cities will upgrade almost identically i dont like the mixture of fantasy units and gunpowder units conclusion at this point i think that steam workshop support for total war games is almost a requirement not because the games are bad by themselves but because such effortless modding gives these games entirely new life and the freedom to play them as you wish so this review takes that reality into account i am honestly shocked by so many bad reviews for this game this is one of the exceedingly rare times when i think the professional reviewers were more accurate than the gaming public the game isnt perfect by itself but any modest tweaks to the game can be made via the copious mods available in the workshop so unless you just cant stand a fantasy setting for a total war game this is clearly one of the best playing total war games in years moreover its innovation in the rpglike lord and hero skill upgrade paths to me feels like an essential innovation for all future total war games 100 100,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,after playing around 120 turns of an empire campaign and the first 30 of a greenskins cmapaign ive decided to write this review performance wise the game runs well on medium graphics with some on high and ultra unit size on my nvidia gtx 670 and 8gb of ram the game looks smooth and has more shogun ii esque graphics than attila and rome ii the ui is asthetically pleasing and very intuitive and is very customisable going from quite barebones to very informative allowing you to change it up inbattle as always the total war wiki is there for further information the campaign map and its ui is also intuitive full of options and necessary information and again asthetically pleasing moving on to gameplay the fantasy setting brings a new breath of life increasing replayability and bringing new exciting battle mechanics although there are a lack of races to play as 45 each faction is very different to play as in this case less is more the battles themselves are fastpaced full of actions and aweinspiring set pieces there is a lot going on in the battlefield which changes the game up and forces you to bring new tactics to the table the campaign itself is very fun and 120 odd turns in is still very exciting and thrilling the arrival of chaos changes everything where enemies forget their differences and band together to fight the insueing tide of evil the arrival of chaos does not mean a boring survive as long as you can but instead brings an exciting new chapter of stemming the stream of the end times overall the game handles the fantasy setting very well magic is fun and not at all op is feared prerelease and the game is better optimized than rome ii and attila even for nvidia systems total war warhammer is a match made in heaven and brings a new lease of life to both franchises this game is a definate for fans of warhammer total war strategy and fantasy,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,im just going to say what everyone else is the game itself is awesome and the planned expansions will make it one of the best games ever especially for warhammer fans the problem is their dlc policy its going to push the total price of the game to ridiculous levels its probably best to wait 2 or 3 years when theyve released their 2 dozen or more dlc packs and two expansions and its all rolled into one neat game of the year edition or whatever theyll call it and is hopefully far cheaper if you cant wait that long like i couldnt try and buy a cheap steam key from somewhere other than steam for the base game and pick just a few of the dlc packs from the current ones id recommend the king and the warlord and the grim and the grave you can live without the rest they can be bought much later on when they fall in price,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,currently my favourite game all 4 of the starting campaigns are varied and fun have not tried any of the dlc because theres still so much to do with the original game highly recommend,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,for the first time in a long time the battles actually feel weighted which is a good thing i am currently playing as the dwarves and i feel like the lore has been fleshed out very well you really feel immersed in the kingdom you are branching out i do recommend this game for fans of rts as well as warhammer fans i have not come across any bugs in my very short playthrough so far my set up is i5 4670k 16gbs ddr3 ram clocked at 1866 msi 970 i am getting a steady 5560 fps 55 when the magic fields are heavy in my regions i will post a more in depth review after more hours of gameplay,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this game is great even with only 41 races is more various than previous total war and weird to say its really faithful to the warhammer universe yes of course has its flaws ia during siege and more but i simply dont care why pros are way more than the cons and as everyone knows gamesworkshop discontinued warhammer fantasy for age of sigmar so this is probably my only opportunity to see a nonamateurish work that deliver the same rich lore that made me fell in love with the warhammer universe in a strategy videogame the last opportuniy to see the tomb kings in a videogame this will be the definitive warhammer compendium game with all the races my last goodbye to warhammer fantasy ps you gamesworkshop maybe here you can read me you haters too d pps for any warhammer fan out there that isnt sure about this game weve played march of chaos seriously,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,now i have to admit ive been a total war fan since rome 1 but the last few titles had issues for me not so with warhammer though i find the inability to claim all territories irritating the fact mods allow me to from day 1 as well as coop racing with friends is a big plus for me gameplay wise its a beautiful game i have to run on low spec due to an older system but it still looks great i love the vampire counts and yes if you build your province right you can field a massive host im about to do battle with 3 terrorgheist i had no issue on start up always a plus there and the races feel unique which i love in short if your a fan of warhammer hit this up and enjoy the power of magic which is amazing to be honest if not a fantasy fan at least try it you may be surprised,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,excellent game which is being continually developed and supported by the devs there is a major roadmap for future free and paid content this was one of the smoother total war launches i have experienced i could actually play a multiplayer campaign from launch day without constant dcs and crashes the dlc can be a little pricey lots of the negative reviews are salty about this but there is still plenty of content in the base game plenty of online replayability without having to reach for your wallet so you can take it or leave it multiplayer balance is coming along and is in a fairly good place at the moment they have mainly managed to capture the spirit of warhammer with a good part of what makes a total war game and i can only see this game getting better with age,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,short verdict captures the feeling of the warhammer universe perfectly music art voice acting everything cavalry and army clashes have more crunch to them than they used to if you could run attila and rome 2 youll run this even better battle ai is better campaign play is better because of optimized cpu usage meaning no more 15 minute turns each faction is very different not only in battle but how they play in campaign ie vampires get to corrupt mortal lands and start up covens to disrupt their public order orcs always have to be fighting or your armies kill each other etc highly recommended long verdict pros five six in custom battle warhammer fantasy armies each lovingly detailed with different play mechanics great soundtrack campaign is extremely accessible perfect for people who have never played total war before campaign ai is more intelligent no more of armies running between two points as you ruin their kingdom they also back off when they see you have a strong defense very in depth magic system gives a new layer of strategy to battles customizable lords and heroes choose their equipment and talents cons environmental destruction and fire effects have been severely downgraded from the spectacle they were in attila no unit formations ie wedge formation for cavalry spear walls shield walls etc no more small settlement battles and therefore no random civilian killing as your army moves in all sieges happen in large and famous cities no options to change the season weather or time of day in battles meh sieges are relegated to one corner of the city im indifferent to this due to warhammer lore diplomacy in campaign is somewhat limited in the kinds of interactions you can have with other factions im indifferent to this very lore accurate that chaos barbarians and orcs would not come to humans with any sort of trade agreement you cant conquer whole map only the cities and provinces of your nemesis faction again i dont care about this but perfectionists might i do miss the ability to choose ammo types for ranged units having one type of ammo for everything simplifies things however leaving more time to micro for magic first time ive finished a total war campaign in a while cant wait until they add the elf factions to this game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,so i never bought attilla and delayed buying tww for a long time because i had my faith seriously tested by twr2 this game also appeared so expensive for me and ofc there is all the dlc issues which adds up to more than the retail price of the game however now that i have bought it i can not stop playing it was so worth the money i spent on it the stuff that i thought were going to be issues are not issues they make the game example 1 you cant paint the entire map this is so not an issue it actually works quite well the sackraze is great and makes perfect sense in the game design and there is so much to do just winning your own campaign and seeing off all the invasions from the areas you cant control makes for a great game 2 the chaos invasions these add so much pressure to the game it creates a driving purpose to be ready for the next wave of invaders it makes every turn precious 3 the whole dlc to unlock content thing i can now see just how much effort has gone into making each faction a completely different play experience the entire campaign mechanic and storyline and imperative changes with each faction they have different units unique technology tree and totally different playstyle it is almost like an enirely new game when you switch factions i cannot wait to get enough of the starting factions and will definitely be buying the other factions as well vampires chaos here i come,1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i played warcraft 2 when it came out on a 56k modem this is the best fantasy battle rts ive played since i ing love the warhammer fantasy ip and ive played it since the late 80s this game absolutely nails the feel of waging massive battles with fantastical troops and creatures gorgeous models top notch voice acting sound effects and an epic score i hum when not playing warhammer to the bone in atmosphere endless fun tweaking with army composition and experimenting with different tactics free dlc released regularly pay dlc unquestionably worth the money 1010 would raise altdorf again,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,finally the old world comes to fruition i have read all the old world novels from the time of legends to the nagash stories fantastic books and collectors items come dawi for there are grudges to settle love the dwarves always have they have beautifully rendered these stalwart champions the battle are epic and enormous in scale every piece of this game breathes warhammer my only complaint was not adding the druchii the dark elves are a huge part of the old world and malekith is a beast who needs to be brought into this game i wont knock a star off for it yet because im hoping this will come in dlc 5 star game highly recommend to anyone who loves warhammer the old world and total war,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,if youre a fan of the fantasy genre and of strategy this is a good game to get into enjoying the game myself so far,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,being really fast in my review its simply the best total war game ever made each faction plays completely different from the others and the game is way more straightforward than every other total war game to date it have a bit of a shogun feel to it and the ai can give you a run for your money even in normal difficulty i super recomend it for every fan of total war tittles or anyone that likes a good whaaaaaaag,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,definitely the most polished total war release to date a solid 910 at release pros all the races have extremely different rosters and play styles that keep you interested in the game for much longer than a normal total war title i usually find different nations have rosters that are very similar in normal total war games the lore is interesting and at times funny battles are flawless and the flying units are pretty cool cons i feel like the chaos hordes arrive too quickly in the campaign maybe if they came in at around turn 100 itd be better all in all im looking forward to expansions of this game should be interesting,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,fanboy alert i have played every total war game uptill now and can safely proclaim that this is the best tw so far even surpases loved and praised shogun 2 this is it the series mechanics works with warhammer world just great graphic and animations are beatiful and well optimized battles are large and immersive game is true to the lore every race plays differently voice acting and ingame movies are top quality first of tws that dont require any mod to play game to full potentional and likeness warhammer let me be the heretic and say that fantasy works just better graphic and animations optimized experience even on mediocre hardware gameplay and inovations for example fly units playable races dont really enjoy the chaos but thats my personal aversion to horde magic and rune system bugs free i am one lucky guy apparently no crashes or problems with singleplayermultiplayer after day one patch no elves hope for dlcflc 1010 waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is my favorite total war game to date i am relatively new to the franchine however i started with shogun 2 but did not really get into the game untill rome 2 i think the the warhammer fantasy setting is a perfect fit for total war each of the factions feels unique unlike most of the previous total war games making it a joy to play all of them it also makes diplomacy more interesting because instead of just dealing with a lot of humans you get to deal with fantastical creatures the hero units are great too they feel more impactful compared to previous generals in total war upgrading them with new skills and giving them new weapons feels more satisfying when you see them in action the game is not perfect though it lacks mouth movement during diplomacy and many factions do not even have voice lines for trade all of the empire factions look the same except for their troosp are a different color pallet all of their leaders use the same two or three models however so they dont feel distinct overall i would highly reccomend this game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ive been playing tw since the first shogun and after getting burned by rome 2 i was pretty skeptical but the games solid pros great job on optimization at least compared to previous games battles are the best theyve ever been new elements like magic and monstrous creatures add a great level of depth to combat very well polished and atmospheric voice acting music and general sound is all great ai all around though not perfect and prone to hiccups here and there is certainly very much improved campaign map is less tedious additions like quests add immersion and things to do besides blobbing global recruitment cons agents can get a little frustrating with how weak they are against other agents even with witch hunters with level 3 assassination or whatever its called will take like 5 or 6 tries and 3000 gold later to actually wound some sorcerer whos the same level as him quests tend to pull you all over the map so while theyre really cool and a great feature they can get a bit frustrating at times for example part of a quest demanded that i ally with nordland but despite fighting all their same enemies being friends of their friends and showering them with gifts it took an extremely long time for them to accept anything i had the next part of the quest acquire a rocket battery done well before it no navies your mileage may vary general system still in place whilst global recruitment addresses this it feels more like a bandaid than a feature maybe its for the ai to prevent tiny stacks everywhere but i greatly preferred being able to freely move units wherever i wish ive been told the reason is to focus on smaller bigger battles but in my experience it just makes every battle the same 20v20 or 20v8 a better option i think would be to allow more units in a single stack and reintroduce the interception mechanic from empire but hey im not a programmer so if its better this way then so be it campaign map though less tedious is becoming more and more simplified im not crying over sanitation and food but i do miss the long extensive building chains in previous total wars even just things like upgrading roads it was cool seeing the province develop and looking at actual ships and wagons traveling between towns as a side note i do have to give praise to ca or sega or whoever has been in charge of marketing it it was very transparent with live gameplay being easily available to watch though i dont know why a bunch of random youtube streamers who dont play total war were given copies id much rather just watch the ca group or actual tw streamers play it was also a good show of faith to move chaos from preorder to 1st week free whilst i despise early dlc stuff it was still a nice gesture and shows they listen to the community all in all a great game definitely recommend,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,genre turn based fantasy strategy i was a massive warhammer fan back in the mid 90s but havent been able to get into the tabletop significantly since i played shogun total war a lot back in the day but havent got into any total war games until this one i got this game on preorder with the free chaos expansion i played through the dwarf campaign on easy and no mods managing to earn a win after a lengthy session then i tried the chaos and beastmen achieving campaign wins with both and having fun on the way i only fought the odd battle auto resolving most due to the limited time i have to play games nowadays i miss being a student so much since then i have tried running unsuccessful campaigns as the empire and vampire counts due to what i think was an op chaos invasion with powerful armies and the norse types becoming automatic vassals attacking from all sides that was restricting my ability to capture enough cities for a win this i admit led to a few rage quits i have since experimented with mods and found one that disables the chaos invasion now i have played through with all three other races and had a great time dominating the map i have also tried a few coop campaigns these have been fun and although the objectives are basic you get to try out some interesting alliances the main problem i have here is coinciding the time to play the various races have there own unique objectives and through the free and paid dlc you can get more races factions and units these can be used in all your grand campaign games to add more variety i know some people dont like paid dlc but with each one i have got so far exc the blood pack i have felt they are value for money and give significant added enjoyment to the game there are loads of free community mods that allow you play the game the way that you want without paying extra money too i think it is just a shame that it feels the main story of the campaign of the chaos invasion was not thoroughly play tested for balance across all the races without it you are able to have some great sandbox warhammer themed fun though,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,when i first bought the game i was very skeptical because of the negative reviews however after installing and playing it i must say it is total wars master piece thus far it is beautiful and runs smoothly for me i had no issues at the start up screen that so many were complaining about the diversity among the factions is a nice change and the required play style is different for each one as well well done ca thank you for a well made game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,alright theres alot of mixed and negative reviews on here so i figured id go in and throw my hat for a positive review alot of the negative reviews are recent and are based on the call of the beastmen dlc or if you want to be less fancy beastmen race pack furthermore alot of them are critiquing a combination of things regarding that dlc and are pasting it on the main page well 20 bucks per race pack if thats cas plan is extreme ill grant them that and thats a discomfort but heres something i couldnt find anybody mentioning when i was skimming through the negative critiquesthe beastmen are freely showing up in the campaign as an ai race you only have to kick in if you want to play as them not against i feel if the dlc mentioned that it might help it retain some gravitas or resemblance of sanity in this comment section as i milled through it when it was in preorder and bought a copy of it for myself kicking myself for that a bit now as i didnt actually want to play the buggers i just wanted an extra threat to show up for later in the game but i digress whats goodbad about this game good pretty lore accurate as far as i can tell depictions of most of the beasties and monsters in this game from this setting ai can now use cavalrylight speedy assault units to actually go after squishies grand campaign is a managable conquer simulator which the modders in the workshop have enhanced to allow you to make it an unmanagable insane inventory filling abomination just like the old grand campaigns the combats got alot of interesting questions to learn the answers to q can graveguard fight a giant a maybe each race plays differently from each other race in noticable ways beastmen have a pressure to always attack yes i did try out the 20 buck investmen greenskins cant really stop rebellions but dont really want to as it creates sweet free waaagh stacks vampire counts want to slowly invade the rest of the world corroding the morales of others into welcoming their new vampiric overlords imperials and dorfs play more or less like old total war with imperials having a special promotion system as their unique mechanic and dwarfs gaining quests for allies being harassed or themselves losing groundfights in battle its a fantasy rts out of battle its a fantasy turn based kinda grandstrategymabob with the grand strategy really devolving into whos your friend vs whos your enemywhich direction youre going to war in next if they call stellaris grand strategy this is really more of the same in that respect both of which arent exactly the most populated genres independently and getting both together is a bit light and ultimately the model designs are beautifully well crafted with the workshop letting you pimp them if you feel theyre not quite glorious enough im sure someone has had the same idea youve had alright lets go to the bad well everyones ing about the price point but honestly alot of games release with less features then this one does and offer the new features as monodlc this doesnt offer the new features exclusively as dlc again people who kick in 60 get the same experience outside of what forces chaos can field and what races they can play personally as people whove got all the dlc what it does do that personally kind of offends me is offer the new features without a great deal of bug testing i think the reason for this on the beastmen dlc was that they wanted to keep this game on peoples radars and shelves but stilli mean if theyd waited a few more weeks maybe they couldve stopped their entire bug page on their forum from being repeats of beastmen buggy a few of which ive experienced personally the game could use a pruning on bugs seriously the games got quite a few problems still which is surprising because most of these i wouldnt have expected given this is sharing an engine with total war rome 2 im fine with them because alot of these bugs arent game breaking but if you were to jump back just a week a week and a half the game would occasionally have enemy armies be invisible until they were 50 meters out which is crippling for any artillery players although not so much for chaos yes yes i preordered the game or vampire counts my two main races the game tends to not have enough diversity in the late game frankly if you kill a race off its gone and currently theres not really much possibility of anything showing up resulting in imperials needing to erase the ai vampire counts and since ai doesnt know how to play vampire counts thats a pretty easy task and the incoming chaos hordes and then they can kinda justsit there and resettle until they win meanwhile dwarfsonce the greenskins are gone theres pretty much nothing for them to do but slowly confederate all the other dwarfs into their massive dwarf empire i was hoping beastmen would shake this up buthonestly they have a pretty nasty tendency of dying really early in the campaign currently i dont know why the ai doesnt like using higher tier units i was really patient on a vampire counts hard game i didnt kill the actual human empire for a hundred and fifty turns their one high tier unit in their army was two squads of demigryph knights that was it i had half a dozen terrogheists split across 6 armies and the empire had two squads of demigryph knights if the game was actually simulating the ais path id be fine with this but the ai has infinite money to do what it needs to do and it has heroes that level every turn could we get some and i hate to say this just a little bit of cheating to make the ai match its lands maybe nuln has a tendency to have riflemen or a steam tank sitting waiting after the first 2030 turns for example asis chances are youre only seeing the cool you can do and its never really highlighting the other races as well as it could outside of quick battle where the ai kinda just grabs one of everything and as many many people have put they dont release full races which isdiscomforting because beastmen are missing three units chaos warriors cant tap into the power of the dark gods individually outside of the campaign map and even on the campaign mapits kindalackluster and random whether the gods let you reach for them at all chaos warriors are a great i want to be a dark magic barbarian simulator not really all that good for the chaos part of it though vampire counts dont have everything for them yet theyre missing strigoi ghoul kings and two engines imperials dont have all their mages blah blah blah would i reccomend this game absolutely the tldr of the above is that this games fun if you dont have the money to buy a race you want then seriously just wait for a sale for the thing to go down to 5 bucks dlc always gets hit the hardest in sales,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,the end times have arrived chaos fanatics and abominations led by archaon the everchosen the threeeyed king and favored son of chaos march everforward from the desolate north with a single goal set before them to bring forth the end of the world in honor of the dark gods entire nations of men have fallen orks have been wiped out from the world and the only thing standing against the tides of darkness is an uneasy alliance between the mountain dwarfs and the undead legions of sylvania or at least it would be if the damnable dwarfs didnt decide this was prime time to exact revenge for a trade dispute that occurred ages ago as i sat there watching my entire empire crumble i was left wondering if i should be angry the ai decided to essentially throw the entire campaign and condemn us all to eternal damnation or genuinely impressed it managed to do exactly what the dwarfs in warhammer lore would do seek revenge against anyone foolish enough to end up in their great book of grudges the factions,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,still playing and testing the game total war warhammer is a nice alternative to total war atilla and total war rome ii total war warhammer is all in one not a improvement over the other total war games but it offers a new experience of total war pro graphic realistic better ai than total war atilla and total war rome ii most important mods are already available performance is struggling sometimes standard camera is somehow broken formations of some units are missing no seafight only 5 races but they are completely different camera can be fixed with mods i am actually enjoying this game even without having time for it because of my study overall 810,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,the game along with my disappointment over the current console generation that inspired me to upgrade from my old a6 powered laptop and build my first gaming pc my only regret is that i didnt do it sooner total war is up there as one of my favorite game series warhammer 40k are my favorite fictional universes thankfully ca have done a good job of bringing the two together and continue to improve on the base game with some decent dlc except the bloodgore one this really should have been part of the base game beastmen is overpriced while the game has its issues legendary lords are way too op even given the source material ai is missile unit heavy many overworld and diplomacy exploits it runs great can be really challenging i now save scum on every turn before every battle and is just a fun nerdy time sink total war warhammer total war warhammer does exactly what is says on the tin,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i love this game honestly i do pros combines warhammer and total war in a great way a lot of content most unique total war game to date very unique races units lords and heroes graphics voiceacting music and sound is amazing magic is a great addition just like the various new unit types reimplements good features from older games like provinces character customization is very cool improved ai both in battles and the campaign great support from the developer cons rare crashesperformance issues long loading times the ai has been improved but its still lacking magic seems a little unbalanced attack spells are quite weak compared to the buffs ai heroes can be very annoying on the campaign map lacking multiplayer most cons are details while the pros are big and very welcome i would rate the game 810 recommended,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,despite a lack of game complexity and dumbed down features from previous total war titles i was excited to experience the lore and battles of the warhammer series from a more visual and immersive medium there is a lot of potential for the game to be expanded upon especially with proper support for the modding community it will be interesting to see whats introduced as dlc as the game makes you want more,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,if you think i missed something in my review feel free to tell me the time has come for war,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is a really refreshing game as far as the total war series is concerned i was initially concerned by them going in the warhammer direction but my fears no longer exist it is such a nice feeling to send your hero unit into battle and watch the mayhem he creates it reminds me a little bit of sauron just destroying units except its not sauron but karl franz they improved a lot as far as cavalry is concerned too it used to always be a little disappointing to me in previous games when a cavalry charge would just fail because the enemy turned his units just on time now cav has weight and units will go flying even when prepared also no more of that if one unit is engaged the whole cavalry stops and turns back bs spells are fun to use as well seriously powerful but not completely op the campaign is actually really intelligently done too when i first heard that say the empire could only take occupy other human settlements and vampire count settlements i was a little concerned but it turns out it is really a smart move because now every campaign will automatically feel different since you will be settling in different regions completelyish i had stopped enjoying total war games since shogun 2 however i can now finally say that this is no longer the case bottom line this game is great and i highly recommend it oh and you dont need to be a big warhammer fan to enjoy the game i barely know anything about it yet i am having a blast i am sure it helps but i dont think you will miss serious storyaltering facts yes i realize warhammer fans now think im a giant moron im okay with that,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,one of the best total war releases so far every faction is unique and plays differently giving you a huge amount of replayability total war warhammer is a game every warhammer fan and even every total war rts fan should pick up,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ive been a long time fan of the tw franchise but wasnt enthused about rome2 and i didntplay attila however tww had made an incredible leap forward with its engine story telling and presentation i love the difference between the races till now factions were pretty much texture swaps with a few units getting bonuses and possibly a limited amount of unique units that looked a lot like other units now we have different models different animations different army structures different economies different play styles completely unique units the addition of spells and flying creatures shake up how we used to think about fighting in this game theres lots of game play additons here as well ai that will actually keep their word and have different temperments massive amounts of personalization for your characters abilies equipment and followers you can change your equipments around and gift it to other heros or generals heros can now take part in battles the leveling system is a lot more incrimental giving you more choices your main faction leader has individual quests that unlock incredible items ca also did a great job of sticking to the games workshop ip of the old world it feels like warhammer over all huge thumbs up more to do more and different ways to do it and a metric ton of replayability,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this is decent game and in my opinion is better than its predecessors the factions are well balanced and the new hero and wizard units make a great addition to the game with that said there are a few bugs at the moment that let it down 1 i am unable to play multiplayer due to the game crashing as soon as i select it 2 the game sometimes crashes on the start screen 3 ridiculous waiting time for the game to strart when it does not crash edit all bugs have been fixed,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,a great game that runs so much better than any of the recent total war games it still has some of the issues of total war ai but all in all the battles are a ton of fun probably gonna easily sink a couple hundred hours into this game,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,i love this game the more content the better in my eyes i love the lore and gameplay,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,ive already had some of my favourite moments ever in a total war game it has problems but i havent enjoyed playing a game as much as this since medieval ii,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,definitely the best modern total war since shogun ii the factions play very differently from one another but are also reasonably well balanced any issues you have with the openendedness of the campaign can be fixed via day one mods easily the least buggy release by ca in a long time,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,to preface this for transparency reasons ive been given a press copy of total war warhammer total war warhammer has turned out to be a pretty spectacular game and will form a strong basis for future content expansions ive been a huge warhammer fantasy fan for over ten years ive played call of warhammer for medieval ii and mark of chaos for pc its been awesome to see creative assembly provide a really quality game pros 1 it feels very well optimized and the turns end quickly 2 the factions are defined and unique there isnt a copypaste feeling that 3 the magic is varied and while it needs rebalancing for offensive magic is a welcome addition 4 the aesthetic of the towns and campaign map is amazing this is the new standard for future total war titles 5 the ai feels more competent and logical they attack when its advantageous they may broker for treaties and so forth cons 1 theres still a need for an arcade option like in rome i the battles are very fast and almost overwhelming especially with the addition of a new micromanagement option magic 2 i dont know yet how this is late game but right now units will break and come back quite often this makes the pacing of the battles feel frantic the balance needs looking into for a more cohesive experience i want to be able to watch the battles from time to time or have formations retained 3 i really did hope for a form of tabletop painter for units ive always wanted customization in the vein of the avatar mode in shogun 2 the idea of changing their appearance and colors is pretty intrinsic to a warhammer experience for my own personal score i give it a 810,1,0
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,got home today and waited for the upload of the hotfix once done i embraced my darker side and started a vampire counts campaign 19 turns in and all but shcwartzhafen is under my sway with a solid foundation of cities in eastern sylvania mannfred has immersed himself in the lore of death and has acquired the sword of unholy power from its resting place now let the feeble minded cattle of stirland quake for the dark counts of sylvania ride again 1010 update 14616 during the 3 weeks or so that i have had the game i have now had the opportunity to play all the races in campaign vampires quite hard to build outwards due to vampiric corruption but a good challenge stirland is under my sway and now i consolidate waiting for the next moment to strike dwarfs rather easy campaign on normal with the help of the humans numbers was able to crush chaos after obliterating the orcish tribes south of blackfire pass and all through the worlds edge mountains karak ankor lives again empire still playing through as karl franz both the empire and dwarfs find it easier to expand due to confedeartion mechanics archaon has been sent packing once and has returned once karl wields ghal maraz i shall march north and destroy the chaos threat once and for all orcs waagh azhag is progressing nicely however it can be difficult to maintain momentum north however karazakarak lays within my hands and the dwarf empire is in even more tatters than before throgrim has been sent packing and only now rears his face the crown whispers to me and i shall obey out of charcter 1110 review love the game enjoy the tactical side and building settlements i will try it on hard next time and see if i can truly challenge myself only gripe quest battles hard to get through all the item battles before the end of the game as theyre always further and further away but that one gripe is not enough to spoil the game in any way love it love it love it if you liked warhammer in the last 30 years buy this game update 260716 keeping this review updated as i feel it helps others as of now i have completed the empire dwarf and vc campaigns of all of them the vc campaign i feel i played the slowest but finally managed to wipe the empire from the map whilst contending with the chaos threat the corruption mechanic does make the game more difficult for the vc especially in the early phases i also made a mistake going round the south part of the map eliminating the border princes before wiping out estalia tilea and bretonnia with mannfred leading the charge just chaos to complete a far different proposition but a challenging one on the dlc i feel that it is worth it i will be prepurchasing soon but before i will be revisiting the dwarfs to try and improve my last performance it was my first campaign in terms of speed before diving into the beastmen next week all i can continue to say is how great this game is and how much fun it is to play and the dlc seems to be a continuous stream of new content still 1110 and a brilliant investment if you wait for a sale in december id go as far as 1510 because you will get it at a steal but i know i wouldnt be able to wait that long,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,this game combines all that one loved of the total war franchise adds in all the best bits of the warhammer franchiseand combines them perfectly miss the old days of total war medieval but always wanted fantasy and magic added in then this is your game love the warhammer lore and all that but hate the price or model gaming then this is your game of course in current total war greedyness outside of the core game there is and will be to come a lot of dlc you should know this by now going into a total war game this does not ruin or end the game for me personally as the core one has more than enough for the price in my opinion it also lets me pick and choose what factions i may want in the future what stories etc bring on the skaven,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,amazing game im playing on a low tier pc and i give this game a 8510 im sure once i upgrade it will be a lot better ive been playing for about 7 hours now with no issues this game runs better than attila if you love warhammer and total war get this game right now the good 1 easy to pick up gameplay if youre new to any total war game 2 graphics are good if youre used to cod like graphics this game is not for you 3 optimized very well im getting 40 fps on a below min requirement pc 4 130 turns in with the empire and its still not stale 5 quest battles are fun and give good rewards that help you on the campaign map im sure moddersdlc and flc will add more 6 combat is a bit slower than attila 7 flying units the bad 1 if you want to run this game on max settings youll need a decent computer 2 lack of factions 3 magic is a bit hard to get used to the ugly 1 the game still needs a bit of polish in terms of hotfixes but ive been playing for 130 turns and have not run into anything game breaking update most of the negative reviews are not legit if i can play on my potato of a computer youll be fine ive played every total war since shogun and this game feels like tw is going back to its roots with a fantasy story also if you notice the negative reviews are from people playing less than a hour,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,not really sure what all the fuss about the black screen bug when you launch the game it was a simple fix check your firewall settings verify cache or launch in offline i got the game on release and that happened i just had top launch in offline thats what 90 of the downvotes are,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,an awesome warhammer game and the best total war game that revolutionized the saga it delivered practically everything i had hoped for small negatives after a while realtime combat becomes redundant diplomacy system still could be more usefull and needs refinement while your ai allies drag you into too many useless wars too quickly some dlcs are a bit overprized,1,1
364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,despite all of the issues surronding dlc pricing for the game tww is arguably the strongest in the series i only envision the game improving upon itself as time goes on and ca despite still causing controversey with their preorder bonuses dlc pricing etc have improved marginally compared to the past releases of rome 2 and attila i strongly suggest a purchase if the total war series interests you or even just the warhammer property if nothing else this game is poised to take the place of the now defunct fantasy battle property and it wont quite cost a liver to pay for,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,this game and no mans sky taught me a few things about gaming lessons youd think i would have learned long ago but havent first never buy a season pass from a megapublisher that has no reason to earn it ie ubisoft ea activision since they are already established with a rabid nondiscriminating fanbase they have no reason to go beyond minimal expectations they already have all of our money so why would they do buy a season pass from cd projekt red second never preorder anything ideas are a dime a dozen a lot of games look fantastic on paper but can fall to if not implemented and executed properly this is one of those games i have very few regrets in life maybe two not kissing this one girl i couldve and not finishing something i started putting 300 hours into this game is my third regret as someone who played from release lived through the severe crafting nerfs exploits pvp zone dz hackers scarcity of loot horrible rng of loot i implore you to learn from my mistake and walk nay run away massive the developer has no idea what they are doing allow me to clarify massive as a small fledgling developer was given a project that was too big for their breeches do they have fantastic artists and modelers yes did they nail new york city as a native new yorker born and raised yes did they make a fun cover based shooter only in part after hitting level 30 the game flips on its head enemies become too strong requiring too many bullets to kill the cover based mechanics you relied on to get you that far are subverted by rushing enemies with millions of hp which would all be well and good if loot fell from the skies a la the latest iteration of diablo 3 not diablo 3 from release again another lesson in early adoption but it doesnt you kill droves upon droves of enemies for one chance at one piece of loot that might be the right level with maybe one good stat out of four any time the community figured out a way to obtain gear more quickly massive fixed it read slowed it down again for some reason massive is catering to an extreme niche of gamers that enjoy ultra slow and painful progression like everquest players that insist that if you make a game hard enough slow enough and painful enough to play you can relive the glory days of one of the first mmos you cant those days are gone does massive know how to make a game yes do they know how to make a game fun no massive believes in scarcity and programs from a perspective of scarcity they want your loot journey to be long painful and drawn out there is no light at the end of this tunnel they dont want to make your time in the division more bountiful they dont want you to ever gain the satisfaction of completing a character and i use the word programs loosely if youre at all interested in game development youll get a kick out of all the terrible mistakes they made with the division from horrible netcode to client side tracking of player stats ammo was stored locally so you could just edit your own files for infinite ammo to hard coded event dates in a nut shell rather than using make event every x days they used make event on may 8th 15th 22nd so that when the scheduled dates run out then you run out of events which actually happened in game twice as for the season pass players got one extra room seriously its a mission in a room and then we got procedurally generated sewer tunnels basically the same brick and sewer textures over and over again thats all for the price of 23s of the base game one room and random sewers granted were only halfway through the season pass but thats still not worth the price as an aside i have kept up with massives state of the game streams and am aware of the work they are doing on their next big patch 14 even with the community involvement gear balancing and loot changes it still doesnt change the broken gameplay loop lets be honest this was supposed to be as much a loot hunt game as it was a shooter even if you prefer to focus on the shooting element you wouldnt be able to overstate the importance of gear in a nutshell you shoot things get or craft new loot shoot more things the game breaks at the get or craft new loot stage massives idea of a loot drop game is a slowly dripping faucet and 14 seeks to increase that drip slightly by comparison diablo 3 at release was a dripping faucet that was later turned into a flooding fountain fundamentally its about game design drop more loot to keep players happy and playing longer or drop less loot to keep players unhappy and playing longer at release massives choice wasnt clear i played hoping it would get better i wanted to experience the end game before judging it i wanted to see which direction future patches would take the game not only did it not get better but it got severly worse as one example they increased the crafting requirements by 1500 overnight in short youre overpaying for a good introductory experience that opens up to the most painfully slow and boring progression imaginable update i wanted to wait before updating my review until i had more time to thoroughly test all of the qol changes massive has made with 14 and now 15 but some people cant wait so i will sacrifice thoroughness for promptness with only 10 hours in 145 in spite of all of the changes massive has made my impression of the game has remained wholly unchanged that is not to say that they havent tried to fix these issues because they have and in some regards they have been successful first the open world past 30 has a purpose now all mobs however small have a chance to drop loot whether youre in an incursion a hardchallenging mode mission dark zone pvp area or the open world this was a very necessary step in the right direction likewise there are multiple ways to acquire loot though each method feels a bit more convoluted than the next you can gather intel to hunt daily and weekly high value targets kill bosses that spawn every four hours farm missions as usual run the incursions i advise only as a group survive the underground last in survival mode so the options are there and supposedly no one method is necessarily better than the other having been on hiatus for so long i cant tell you if i was playing as efficiently as possible though i wish i knew knowing massive and their tendency to want to push the entire player base in a particular direction up until 14 there was only one place to get useful gear and it would shift as they updated their content but at this point i dont care there are so many rankings and resources and modes to keep track of that im not going to put the effort into figuring it out really the only way to play the division now is with friends which isnt necessarily a bad thing but one i cant abide ive put in my wow time already and dont plan on adopting that kind of raiding lifestyle again is that necessary for the division no you can use pick up groups for a lot of content but for the best gear you will need a highly coordinated group not that there is anything fundamentally wrong with that its just not right for me anymore so theyve improved the loot situation but i still dont find the end game enjoyable enemies still dont scale well they still have perfect aim you will still get grenadespammed by the nfls best quarterbacks seriously their aim is stupendous and i dont enjoy tweaking their cryptic stat system to figure out if elite damage is more useful than headshot damage or if its even working as intended reduced damage taken used to increase damage taken for example likewise 15 has had tech problems bottom line good budget game no longer fun for me,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,when the division was teased for people to get them hyped the game looked amazing they promised so much and gave a hell of a show when promoting the game so we waited we sat on our hands in order to keep from clapping at the idea of being able to roam around in a world so vast and changing acquiring loot meeting friends and forming expansive teams along the way the game looked awesome and boasted a lot of things to occupy your time thenit released graphics were dumbed down gameplay was repetitive there was no guildclan features matchmaking was buggy weapon and gear bonuses and stats were incorrect the plot of this game shifted from fighting in an environment that was devastated by a virus to more of a giant bug collection where you fumbled and crawled your way through all the pain brought on by the issues in the game just to experience what it was like to level up and ubisoftmassive did little to help even now after rolling out patch 12 they have broken more than they fixed in fact were all sure that they fixed nothing and uploaded a compiled file of bugs into the game instead so lets list what we have here please read this carefully before you ever consider purchasingor even playing for free pros the game looks gorgeous the equipment system is lovely the personal appearance is pretty entertaining static clutter and objects are plenty and not stationary shoot that rat smack that lamp the sounds are great the ambience is just intense with headphones which is good there are plenty of missions to choose from for the first 30 hours the weapon modification system is nice the gunplay is pretty decent cons hold on to your hat there are bugs bugs everywhere i mean seriously this game is made of bugs there is no customer service patches break a lot more than they fix gameplay is very repetitive npcs can shoot through walls players get locked out of instances upon joining a match there is a high chance you will fall through the map get teleported out and fall again graphical bugs left and right youll see the poly blocks floating around where fog should be etc the storyline is extremely boring the game is nothing like the trailers it has been dumbed down the content you see from the e3 promotions totally inaccurate the npcs are all pretty much the same only some have flamethrowers and some have armor the loading screens are excessive every single thing you do prompts a loading screen if you join a group from matchmaking you load for 2 minutes they can kick you during that 2 minutes so your load screen resets before you even load in and what youre dropped where they should have been then it teleports you back to a safehouse and you load for another 2 minutes even for high end pcs the load times are far too long and there is a sickening amount of things that call for them the matchmaking frankly sucks it will not match you with people within the range of your gear so if youre trying to gear up it just tosses you in an open slot and if that group is geared and they dont like that youre not you get booted this makes joining groups for getting into the dz and missions in order to even get gear hard of course you get kicked and get to see those neat load screens the latency is iffy i personally run on a fiber connection and the amount of lag that i see is ridiculous youll watch people scoot down walls youll see yourself teleport several feet from where you took cover youll unload 4 complete magazines into an enemy and do no damage only to see the damage pop up on him 20 seconds later after hes killed your teammate etc the cover system is almost acceptable but its not having your cover system default to the same button as your roll button is just bad youll try to move into cover and roll right past it or attept to roll away from a grenade damage zone and take cover instead thus killing you a lot of the npcs are overpowered this game is punishment if you have to fight a group of npcs that have shotguns not only can they 1 shot you but they have armor and they dont take cover and play smart they rush you without regard of their own health you have to pray that you and your group if you have one can kill them before they get close the dz is boring its a lot of running around shooting npcs to get another level ladder crawling up hoping you get loot then you get it try to get back to extract it and bam some that is leagues above you kills you just to kill you but the dz is one of the better places to get gear well tough then again not a lot of people go rogue since theres no benefit from it the dz is just boring its also impossible to get a good dz group unless you just run into someone in there and they decide to join you matchmaking is useless for this seeing as you cannot matchmake inside the dz makes it even more useless you had best hope you find another lonely soul that doesnt just shoot you on sight there is no endgame once you hit level 30 and fill out your equipment with highend equipmenteh you can go after and hunt the gearsets but thats really just doing the same mission over and over and over and over and over and over and hoping that if something drops its not the exact same thing you already have besides that you get a couple of dailies once you complete those about 15 minutes youre too bored to continue playing there is no clanguild system you cant do something as basic as create a clanguild name invite friends and have a system to talk to people when in game oh no you have to relay your conversations through uplay if you can meet anyone that plays in gamebecause really the game is pretty much dead lastly for my list is that ubisoftmassive doesnt care they promoted this game they promised so much they have so many resources available to make this an amazing experiencebut they dont bugs that are gamebreaking are left in the game right now if you join a group your ui doubles and you cant use it this has led to people losing items gear skills being changed mid fight and wiping a group etc where is the company where is the customer support theyre nowhere to be found because they have the money and thats the end of it this is an example of a decent enough game thats good for wasting time if youre bored and have nothing better to do that could have been great ubisoftmassive failed this title they got everyones hopes up sold the game and backed off when other games do this they get taken down from steam and there is a widespread refund spree but not in this case people are still praying that it gets as good as it should be and hold on by the skin of their teethbut it wont its like they have 5 people who work on this title2 days a weekfor a few hoursand only if they want to they let the community down they let the tom clancy name down they let every single person who spent 60 on this game down and not because they didnt give us a decent platform to start withbut because once they realized they messed up they quit caring about it and us the divison has been broken since day one almost everything they promised they removed its not as lush vibrant and expansive as they promised it was we got the bait and switch now its struggling to maintain an 8000 playerbase so before you spend your hard earned money on this titlejust dont this is the game that could have been amazing but it wasnt this is the game that robbed us of our enthusiasm this is the game that is dying a very sad and lonely death you can argue that if you get an hour playtime for every dollar that you spent on a game makes it worth the money but it doesnt at 70 hours i saw all this game had to offer and am justdisappointed,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,if i were to write a review a few weeks ago id give it a solid 910 and recommend this game to everyone its an amazing game with beautiful graphics that runs pretty smooth even on my old pc the city is well crafted with amazing little details on every corner and main missions in general are pretty fun side activities are typical ubisoft game though kinda repetitive gunplay is so satisfying with great cover mechanics enemies factions are varied enough with their own characteristics i can go either solo play with friends or go with randoms via matchmaking to do everything in this game the leveling experience in the division is one of the best ive ever had in an mmolite id give the 130 journey a solid 910 and then i stumbled upon the endgame the real meat of the game where im supposed to spend most of my time there cm are really a challenge however theyre kinda limited in number it was originally okay before the incursion patch hit but everything has changed since then its way harder to get crafting materials post patch which means you need to grind your to craft your weapongear incursion is a mess people can exploit it to beat it way easier massive then remove weekly rewards so people whore not exploiting are basically screwed you may choose to not use the exploits but youll be left behind others and you definitely wont stand a chance in the dark zone where everyone is an exploiter if youre a competitive player youll have to use the exploits the first free update is the turning point of the game for me the game is a mess from its core there are too many fundamental problems while maybe can be fixed but will need a lot of work and testing massive can only find the exploits after the players abusing them and when they do fix one players find another two exploits every day theres new glitches and exploits but they can only apply a patch once a week or two and its been going on since day 1 they just cant keep up with the pace of people finding new glitches and you cant blame them for finding those exploits the game isnt supposed to have ridiculous amount of them its been a month and this game feels like a beta for me the division is probably the most squandered potential of a game in years massive needs a timeout to totally fix their game but sadly they dont have it the show must go on,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i gave a guy a soda and he gave me his pants one step closer to saving new york,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ill keep it really short the chances of anyone actually making it to whatever page this review is on are slim its nothing revolutionary but what it does i would say it does well if you know what you are getting into a rpg based shooter amp not a twitch shooter1 shot kill then you will probably really enjoy this game for what it is you will not be quick scoping or dealing out 1shot headshots i dont care that hes wearing a hoodie think way less codcsgo and think more mass effectwitcher in terms of spongyness if your gear and weapons suck then so do you and i dont mean that in an offensive way its just the way it is some people like that some dont i personally am having alot of fun 810 enjoyable solo but really shines with your buddies zero tech or graphical errors settings all set to very highultra has been smooth sailing amp looks amazing,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,this game was fun for the first two weeks of its existence then once you get through the story and have a little fun in the darkzone it becomes a grindfest a very boring grindfest,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,finally they fixed the game with this bigupdate 14 i can finally enjoy the endgame drop item and recalibrate it for enjoy hard mission for the first time i can say good job ubisoft for this update,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,full of hackers full of bugs full of terrible ubisoft coding even if all that was fixed the game itself has no content unless you count mindless grinding to get better gear for no reason content please dont waste your money on this game so many better titles out there that will bring you much more fun and you wont feel cheated after buying them edit 612016 would like to elaborate on my comment about the terriblelazy coding the company has one purpose which is to design code amp publish games they constantly screw it up with bugs broken patches no anticheat failure to perma ban hackers missing dailies untested content full of exploits just to name a few you can hardly say they are doing their job well if you pay any attention to this or any of the other releases they have put out in recent years the things i list are not even opinions the lazyness and nonsupport for the game has allowed hackers to continue to run rampant honestly if they just fixed the hacking people like myself might do more than log in once a week to check what is in the dzboo vendor it would still have its problems yes but at least we could go more than 2 blocks in the dark zone without being headshot through a wall by a hacker until then there are much much better ways to spend your money and time please remember how bad this was when they bombard you with ads for ghost reconwildlands in the coming weeks also remember i warned you,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,the worst game ever dont get me wrong i love this game so much i preorder the gold edition on steam with full price and ive played for almost 700 hrs i tried and played almost every aspect of the game and i also constantly browsing and discussing on division subreddit frankly speaking this is really a nice game but the devs sucks really nice graphic although snowdrop is a new game engine the graphic still looks awesome cover system is good for 3rdperson shooter neat and clean ui design informative but minimal design connection problem as always ubi servers are really bad that even worse in mmo cheaters and hackers everywhere no matter youre playing in pvp or pve there are tons of cheaters makes the game totally unplayable looting and crafting system are jokes you may get nothing worthy for about 4 hours play since the loot drop is awful and the crafting requirements are unreasonable in some way the endgame is tedious maybe its just because this is a new game the lacking of endgame content makes you get bored very soon the new gamemode incursion design is quite bad very small map with 15 waves of overlevel enemies only the pvp is totally unplayable due to cheating and the elite enemies distribution is unbalanced and the rewards are not scale up with the difficulty everyone level up in dz03 and nobody go to dz06 since the rewards are almost the same as dz01 currently there is no cheat detection system implemented they try to find cheaters manually and its inefficiency and inaccurate the ban is also a joke only 3day ban for hacking before and now its only 14day ban cheaters still cheating lots of game breaking glitches and bugs ubisoft ruined almost everything and the support is really slow and unhelpful i submitted a ticket to ubi support on 20th april and got response on 6th may with unhelpful answer moreover lots of problemssuggestions on reddit were discussed redditors pinpoint the issues and even provide possible solutions but devs never listen lots of game breaking issues are not fixed actually i quit this game on 20th april 2016 after a month later theres still no improvement in division so i totally cannot recommend this game although i want to good game bad devs steamreddit snowdrop ubi pvppve 15 pvppvp030601 bug ubisoft42056redditbug 2016420,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i gave this game back from dead award 14 and survival made this have fun everyone,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,got 231 hours on uplay took the free weekend deal to write review for steam yes i downloaded 36gb to write this lol pros probably one of the best looking games out there even after all the downgrades lots of details good textures and not that many towers to climb for an ubisoft game p nice open world with enough stuff to do from bosses to kill to random missions and challenges so much loot you really feel it when you get better gear story is decent nothing you havent seen before tho decent solo awesome with friends darkzone is an interesting place no idea who will shoot you and who will not grindy but that can also be a survival dlc is amazing bloody tense underground is fairly nice aswell bit of corridor shooting that brings you to special locations like a gold vault somewhere under nyc cover works well and like you expect it should work good ui often updates and free content drops like new guns and gear lots of dev interaction on for example twitter reddit and even with their own show on twitch runs fairly well tad high cpu usage but good fps around the board i5357016gb980 cons item crafting is kinda useless character creator is pretty bad you can chose between 3 or so heads with clothes that dont change anything grindy but that can also be a this is all based on the latest 15 patch 14 fixed the game completely,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,with the 14 update i have seen massive improvements in the once bug filled game ubisoft must have called the exterminators because things are finally looking up for this game,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,the 14 update has given the game a fundamental overhaul on every angle its become the game everyone wanted it to be from the start however the game is a little lacking in content right now and the dark zone while theyve implemented ways to not get screwed over in it is still a mess the game is in a state where im happy to recommend it if you enjoy diablo style lootathons and third person shooters but id say its also pretty reasonable to wait and see how things turn out with their future content and pvp updates now that they have a stable foundation to build upon,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i hereby solemnly swear to never ever purchase another ubisoft game from this day to the end of my days,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ubisoft with division at least you taught me to stop preordering games thank you for that unfortunately bought gold edition with season pass the worst buy ever of my 20 years of gaming life 1010 power of advertising,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,marketing done right not at all the epic openworld rpg experience they advertised it to be not at all long review ahead,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,every single update gets exploited incursions are already exploited people already have full sets of the new gearscore 240 you had one job ubisoft to ban these s or at least realize how shamelessly despicable they are and youve failed there is no sense of progression when you let exploiters win your game any sense of this games progression is ruined unless you lower yourself to the standard of being a cheater there is only guess i cant beat em so ill join em and you cheaters thats why this game is actually called the division never paying 60 for a title again ever,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,when it has all been said and done i think most reviews and the criticisms of the the division are warranted to sum it up in a nutshell the division is to gaming history the most wasted potential videogame of alltime it has an excellent premise but it is poorly executed in not only gameplay but story environmental and level design and npc interactions or lack thereof the lack of an anticheat system leaves you wondering what massive entertainment and ubisoft were thinking during the planning strategy and conceptualization stages of development not only do hackers or players without a conscience continue to exploit this game massive has denounced a statement saying that an anticheat system is basically out of the question because we would need to build this game from the ground up again unlike some other the division early adopters i was never butthurt by the e3 gameplay or the mad and sickening hype unfortunately for me i do not understand why some blatantly obvious game designs were not in this game the streets of new york city is barren even as preapocalyptic or apocalyptic world ubisoft and massive should have opted for a ficticious city instead of a realistic new york trading a videogame fantasy world for a more realistic one is one of the major drawbacks to the divisions level and environmental design the problem with this is you have very little to work with because the developer tried too hard to be true to new york citys landscape leaving little to the imagination the loot system is severely flawed the gear rating system massive has in place is misleading for example a player can have a gear rating of 204 but have less damage per second health or skill power than a player with a gear rating of 190 basically put the gear rating is skewed and distorted i may not know everything about mmolike or mmo videogames but i have played my fair share in that i have some credibility as a gamer who once appreciated mmos and especially mmorpgs like dark age of camelot world of warcraft golden days warhammer age of reckoning guild wars 1 and 2 and modern ones like the secret world while i draw comparisons i want to say that the mmos i mentioned at least tried to bring in new game mechanics and mmo worlds that brought something new and most importantly fun gameplay and loot the division features loot as guns and gear which in some sense it does well the character design is pretty to look at and the clothing equipment and armor all look great aethestically but nothing more the division relies heavily on crafting and farming pheonix credits which you would then trade in to a vendor to purchase new weapons equipment or blueprints at the moment players have to rely too heavily on crafting gear in order to take on the only incursion we have in the game daily assignments are few and far in between so you would have to complete the daily assignments for pheonix credits every day in order to rack up hundreds of credits to purchase the gun or blueprint that you need to pack any kind of punch for an incursion massive did state with a recent update that they are attempting to remedy this issue we will see about that mmos have instances or dungeons and this is typically the meat of the endgame where players farm for loot or gear ubisoftmassive gave us an incursion called the falcon lost as a free update this is the problem and plague of the current situation of the videogame industry free updates and what is it really the base game of the division before the incursion update was barebones as you can get very little content as in a few missions and nodes on the map that would give you vertigo thinking about assassins creeds nodes on the map that induced ocd this is probably the most shallow aspect of the game besides its story and npc interaction in story mode on another note the division lacks any sense of threat you never feel like the city is lost in shambles not even in the dark zone which is suppose to be the darkest corners of the game like i have said before the game design falls short immediately when the player does not feel any sense of threat urgency and motivation to bring cause and effect to attention because simply there is none and that in itself is a sad fact of the game the dark zone is lackluster full of hackers and wasted potential in dz you are doing the same thing over and over and if you are expecting the dynamic of human vs human or pvp interaction in the same vein of dayz and like games you will be very disappointed there are too many hackers the punishment and reward system is severely flawed and it does not reward coop players one simple rule as with past mmos or mmolike games is simply this add a pvp toggle on or off option it is that fvking simple you may be wondering why i have invested so many hours in the division and have the audacity to thumbs down the game in such hypocritical fashion its quite simple i review games after i have given enough game time especially when it is an mmolikestyle game it is only fair after a handful of updates with the addition of the free incursion and massives inability to resolve the glaring issues in the game i cannot recommend it to anyone at this price point i cannot even recommend the game for 1 because it would be a waste of your time you are better off spending your time doing other things seriously i mean this sincerely i could keep writing going in to massive detail about what should and should not be in the division but it would be an overwhelming task that only my mind can understand at the moment most players would agree that the division is a huge wasted potential the proportionality of negative to positive reviews is not only valid but almost sound if you were to ever experience such disappointment without reconciliation of the fact you just wasted not only your hard earned cash but also your valuable time verdict not recommended avoid until massive and ubisoft implements an anticheat system and addresses and resolves several issues in the game while i understand this is massives first roundabout at a game such as this one it comes with its own challenges and complexities which deviate from the standard and traditional singleplayer and multiplayer affair even though i cut massive some slack on that front there are far too many minor and major issues massive continues to overlook which leaves me to question their approach and strategy to fix some of the games many problems,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ill keep it nice and simple for the white knights commenting oh em gee 400 hours pay closer attention to the cons you will notice majority of them listed came to light about a month after release pros pvp graphics storyline being generous cons cheaters no anti hack 3 day ban for the first offense warning following a permanent lt lol teleporting aimbot infinite ammo rpm increase rate of fire to shoot 100 bullets in 1 seconds big head so a players head is enormous to the point where you can shoot them even if they are in cover exploiters broken talents lack of end game content crafting is tedious developers need a couple weeks to apply a single fix server lag due to everyone exploiting community worried about exploiters and dailies over the hackers lt lolx2 game was never ready for release or is anywhere near it seems like it was forced for whatever reason well played massiveubisoft seif3r,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i gave my best to make this game work and it just chewed up my effort to like it and spat it back into my face alright lets start with the good in this game 1 immense potential to be a great pvp game to play with friends provided any of them stuck long enough thorugh the issues which is unlikely 2 initial part of the game is fun but hitting level 30 everything goes downhill now onto to the downhill parts of the game 1 unless you were early enough to exploit and hack when ubisoft didnt give a youre already behind and catching up is a grindfest 2 by a grindfest i mean playing same missions over and over and over again with no variation hoping that this time you get at least a miniscule amount of upgrade for your equipment 3 equipment sucks not only do you have to chase the flavor of the patch build to stay competitive getting the actual items is not enough if you dont roll good stats and most likely you wont its back to the start of the mission grind you can do 10 or more incursion best missions for item drops also the hardest and most time consuming and still be at the same point as you were in at the start of the game 4 theres no enemy variety whatsoever bosses are the same ing bullet sponge with a different name 5 pvp is a joke its inherently broken and every attempt to stop the overgeared players from stomping on casuals in pvp zones has failed miserably and i dont see it ever improving 6 every actual improvement to this game feels like its been forced by outside forces new content coincidentally same day as overwatch release massive finally caring about rampant hacking and exploiting probably because 90 of the player base already abandoned the game and overwatch already showed 0 tolerance towards hacking this was a game of immense potential but its been built on shabby foundations and it will never get better ubisoft has cashed in on another bestseller and they are moving their attention elsewhere the barren wasteland thats the division is not and will never be worth your time stay away,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,warning do not buy this game whew got that outta the way now lets get on with the pros first before i tear this pos game a new one pros the world looks gorgeous progression from level 1 30 is enjoyable and umm i guess thats it cons this might be one of the worst full price aaa game that i ever had the displeasure of purchasing this game quite possibly has every single problem that any other aaa game has encapsulated in a single broken game unbalanced buggy toxic community you name it the division is suffering from it whats baffling is the fact that not only was it suffering these problems on release day its still suffering from this problem months after its initial release in fact each update aggressively makes this game worse the developers somehow think that since other games had this problem that means they get a free pass to do it too now lets get into the bad points the worst endgame i have possibly seen in an game courtesy of unbalanced pvp that is mandatory no skills needed why because a full geared nolifer can be in the same instance with someone who is just fresh lvl 30 with no gear weighted loot drops to hinder pve players progress functions to funnel people into the dark zone basically pushing pve players to become sheep for the pvp griefers in there hence mandatory pvp oh and its not balanced multiple layers of rng im talking inception layers of deep here rng for the item you wantxrng of item lvlxrng of basic statsxrng of item talentsxrng of bonus attributes worst part item of lower level can still drop in high areas and high level items can have ier stats than that of lower level items unbalanced and useless talents really only 3 usable skills others are subpar or downright buggedglitchy numerous bugs and glitches ubisoft trying to be the new ea toxic community when youve got a game that encourages and rewards griefing ie any method of reversing another players progress you will attract these type of people arrogant fword developers they dont know what theyre doing but they know how to nerf anything that is beneficial to the player eg a bug that dropped four high end items are patched within hours but glitches that disabled hundreds from accessing their characters are fixed after a month now you might say im being a little harsh but after suffering the mental torture that this game has inflicted on me id say im being a tad bit generous damn you ubisoft and massive you make ea look like angels tldr do not buy,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,uninstalling this game was more satisfactory than being cured of hemroids i didnt enjoy this game the entire 1336 hrs i played it funny thing is i didnt realize that i hated it untill i uninstalled it what a relief no more of the carrot on a stick repetitive loot grind i just wanted the perfect gear and dps so i forced myself into playing it for hrs on end doing the same thing over and over and ing over just to get a slight numbers gain the new patch opended my eyes to how pointless it all is they made it even harder to get new gear and the grind longer i now feel depressed and angry that i wasted 130 hours of my life on this good god ill never get thoes precious seconds back,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,why the did i buy this game when it first launched i defended it thinking it would get better as time went on but it turns out that this is probably the most repetetive and stale games ive ever played and my god the ing grey and white color tones everywhere its so bland it gives me a damn headache ffs it would be great if steam allowed an extended refund offer for games as as this i feel as if i put 80 through a ing paper shredder,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,tldr pvp is terrible and allows nolifers to prevent other players from ever acquiring gear to compete with them in dark zone fights the review let me preface this by saying i have played since first beta i also played the second beta and have also played since launch so i can give a bit more insight than some with that lets get ed pros huge well detailed city cool concept good customization for character outfit first 2030 hours are amazing thats it thats all the pros they explain themselves cons you must follow meta to win poorly thought out longterm goals for players lack of foresight about possible player statsloadout choices poor execution with weapons that can not take attachments undiverse set of options for character creation lack of defined classes for characters undiverse set of weapon choices ie meta only pvp is terribly thought out and executed too many stats on gear that need to be perfect no way to fix it drops are usually worse than what you have crafting barely alleviates issues with gearweapons developers show lack of care on fixing quality of life issues things have been asked for since beta still no fix the player base has dropped over 93 since launch now the cons need explaining if you dont follow meta you will lose every fight period this is the number one rule of the division the developers clearly lacked any thought for what players would do in endgame besides pvp in the dark zone thing is the pvp is so terrible and the choices so undiverse even in update 12 that its boring and unfun you will get stomped time and again by the same people because stats are what decide matches not skill very few choices can even the odds and usually its not enough people all use the same ultimate skill survivor link the same weapons vector aug and m1a and only about 4 or 5 variants of skills of the 40 available skills choices the meta is stale and if you dont conform to the meta you will lose every fight your skill in shooters and smart planning mean nothing here massive the development team lack any sort of modicum of thought representing a coherent amount of foresight they bring out the game to beta only give 1 shotty 2 rifles and 1 lmg for highend we find out in release week that the best weapons are smgs and marksman rifles and this could have averted the meta had we seen a highend smg or dmr in beta they gave these weapons special damage buffs that made them clear choices above all else then they fail to rectify the issue until possibly update 13 to be seen then bring out gear sets find out that the ones that give damage buffs are definitively better and complain that people mixandmatch the pieces for optimum dps and survivability without making sure you needed a full set to get the bonuses that mattered most then instead of fixing this issue for all sets and making them all good they nerf the meta ones tanktician meta starts and they ignore it they put things in the game and then dont do proper qa testing to see whats possible they raise defensive caps on damage reduction and wonder why everyone has ridiculous amounts of hp and cant die explains itself if you have a police magnum or an m9 youd think the magnum would deal more damage right wrong because they are nearly comparable in single hit damage at end game and the m9 can take extended mags a silencer and a laser sight which all give even more stats as the game goes on attachments become more powerful meaning those strong single hit weapons are left behind further there are like maybe 10 options for character face and a few marks and sunglasses woo everyone looks like a russian a off whiteguy a crazy asian or a mad black guy since there arent defined classes everyone can use any skill which mean everyone takes the same skills and gear if possible with very little diversity because certain things are clearly better than others in both pvp and pve better to the point that you are handicaping yourself harshly if you dont follow meta see 1 if you dont take the aug vector or m1a you are handicapping yourself m44 only if you use explosive rounds assault rifles lmgs and shotguns are trash tier the damage difference is overwhelming coming up in 13 they are making changes to these truth is the changes will be poor at best and the meta will still remain if you dont follow meta you lose see 1 want to know what pvp is like in the division imagine you are playing multiplayer in gears of war fun right well imagine to get new weapons you had to win matches against near invincible players who can sometimes 13 shot you sounds less fun i couldnt imagine why people dont like the division pvp you just have to nolife once a new update hits and then you can hold down other players with the new meta to prevent challenge so much fun right then imagine in gears of war the cover system gets you killed more than helping you survive skill doesnt exist in the division just stats playing smart doesnt exist all the gear has numerous stats each one is in a certain slot and you can only ever reroll 1 slot on that gear once you choose the slot you cant reroll another and the price goes up more each roll and its still rng based basically if you dont craft or get a drop that is near perfect minus 1 slot its garbage and wont help you minus being money or resources to break down this means most loot is useless and makes the game unfun as its a lootbased shooter with bad loot selfexplanatory crafting was nerfed because it was a way for players to get around the rng a bit now that its barely useful as bps dont exist for 240 gear rng is back in full swing this is an awful idea players can you make weapon skins go into our cosmetics so it doesnt take up space massive no players can you at least expand our stash size to being bigger than our backpacks massive no players can we at least get enemies that dont one shot anything that isnt a tank build massive literally kill yourselves think about this one the player base has dropped by 93 since launch day that is insane they have lost most of their players and the daily average on based on steams stats is dropping daily if they dont fix these cons they wont have a playerbase left to save their city truth is the pvp was to be a driving factor but because there is no skill involved its all numbers its become boring and repetitive people avoid combat if they arent maxed out in gear and stats because they know they will lose people avoid the dz because its unfun to be killed and unable to even defend yourself due to not your lack of skill or knowledge but stat desparity its pathetic,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,edit between the original post after looking at some of the reviews on here i feel like 90 of them are complete bull 1 server crashed okay good for you but i started playing this as soon as i got off work until just now and had litterally zero issues with the server the fact that they fixed their server problem in less than a day is fine by me ive seen many games launch and not be playable for a week diablo 3 2 uplay sucks how i clicked the copy code to clipboard button when steam prompted me to uplay asked for code i pressed ctrlv and hit enter division launched and played just fine i have not had to open uplay once in order to play this game so how this is a problem i dont know 3 graphics suck ummm get a better card i have a gtx970 and am playing 55 fps on average with dips down to about 40 with a lot going on outside at 1440p btw the game looks amazing in 1440p 4 grinding for gear well yeah genius if you couldnt figure out from the open beta and countless of youtube videos and news articles that this was similar to destiny or diablo in its kill badguy to get better loot to kill harder badguy game then youre an idiot dont buy a genre you dont like 5 ai is bad its an rpg style cover based shooter where the ai uses the cover yes they will pop their head out to shoot at you after a few seconds oddly enough this is exactly what you are doing after you reload does this make you a bad player does the ai act like a real human in any other rpg youve played now that that is out of the way this game has been out less than a day i cant say if this is something i am going to play for months or not but i have enjoyed it so far and have had no reason to give it a bad review if i decide the game actually is bad in a week or so i will revisit this and add an edit to the end if this is the last line you see then i still feel like its a good game and not anywhere near as bad as people are making it out to be i did not realize everyone on steam was going to readcomment on this i will edit this review with actual opinion about the game once i have completed the main story and put some more time into it finished the main story and got boo to 100 in just over 38 hours played happened almost at the same time do to my completionist play style so far the only negatives i have are that microphone is defaulted to voice sensetivity rather than ptt which is annoying but i can mute people dark zone feels lackluster roaming mobs and stationairy groups at the landmarks other than that there isnt much to do in the dz unless you go rogue and kill other players the side missions and encounters were almost all carbon copies of one another which i suppose could get boring realiztically there are a limited number of them total so its only repetative for a little while i enjoyed the story the amount of content included is more than enough to get you to max level i hit level 30 after completing the final mission and i have only a few side missions and encouters to do i wont go too much into gameplay because if you are reading this chances are you have seen some gameplay on youtube and my typing is not going to describe it nearly as well as a video can im looking forward to gearing up for what is to come and playing new content as it comes out maybe i will update this as more content is realeased if you are reading this i decided not to since youtube will pretty much have you covered,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,do not buy riddled with gamebreaking bugs and hackers no hotfixing exploits being in the game for weeks no proper anticheat system is implemented no testing before release no endgame content no reliable way of getting new gearupgrades ubisoftmassive blames the playerbase for their own obvious mistakes each patch seem to take away from the player no communication with the community customer support is nonexistant,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,cheat simulator,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,tom clancys the hacker simulator another producut by ubisoft that failed in all aspects you will enjoy game first 2030 hours but then when you start playing dark zone pvp you will uninstall game like 70 of division community my opinion dont buy game because its full of glitches exploits and hackers there is no report system and best of all no anti cheat system my biggest mistake is spending 60 on this game so you dont do same as me one more thing i want to add to this review massive devs stay away from developing games stay away from this game edit1 06282016 patch 13 ok so i played patch 13 i see small improvements i played dark zone and i didnt face cheater for 30 mins but i still think you will face cheaters cos of no anti cheat system there is a glitch with season pass when you start mission with your friends guess what infinite mission loading because game doesnt recognize you own season pass they manage to fix other glitches and exploits and create new one they put new weapon balance in game that is rly good because you will use other guns not only smg and sniper i still dont recommed this game those developers dont know what they are doing fixing old bugs and creating brand new bugs guys i dont hate tom clancys division im only trying to tell you whats going on with this game ubisoft will lose so much trust because of massive developers edit2 i will update review when patch 13 fix come and also patch 14 this summer thanks for reading,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i really want to like this game this review is written based on version 11 pros,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,can you guys just fix your ing game rather than creating 6million hotfixes that just ended up breaking something else for a game with so much potential you guys manage to somehow wipe your with it or should i say with everyones money patch 12 is out and jesus christ they dropped the ballonce again one is none is still broken incursions are still teleporting players bac this time it happens even if it is just started gj map is now bugged there are invisible walls in the zone still havent fixed the damn dialog box you have new master mods after weeks of that being there and the cherry on top the greatest thing is that now players that knowingly or unknowingly played with a hacker are now getting banned so a ban wave came through attacking literally anyone that even so much as uttered the words pls dont be hacking good on you division you are truly giving a new meaning to being mentally handicapped a few weeks ago when the game first dropped i was hyped so it would have easily gotten a 910 from me but thats no longer the case to be honest the game started out nicely with the introduce of the base of operations and like that but the way they put you in the gamethey put you in as if youve never clicked a mouse or used a keyboard in your life the game is broken to hell and back its as if they couldnt be ed to fix the game a title that was broken at launch now this is ubisoft were talking about and im ashamed to say it but i had faith that they wouldnt up this idea of a post apocalyptic new york people that were able to hit level 30 and get the midas before the first patch they were basically invincible if they had survivor link and the correct roll on the midas this was patched soon after word got out good on you massive but wait theres more than just one bug textures were ing up left right and center physical areas sometimes wouldnt load in causing people to fall to their death through the ground bulletking there are so many cheaters to the point where it has gotten too out of hand with no anticheat and a broken report system its free range on literally everybody and it is almost impossible to go in the darkzone without finding a guy that wont put his fist in your through a wall using aimbot and 10000 rpm ps with the report you need video proof of said person doing it so i hope youve got shadow played my dudes the missions are completely copy and paste and offer little to no team work sometimes missions can be farmed 247 lincoln tunnel and lorraine mainly the incursions were brought it as something of a new way to bring players together to work as one productive unit at least to me it did the exact opposite team work was about 5 of the mission the other 95 were literally just trying not to get one shotted by shotgun rushers with 2million dps and 6million health and armor and on top of that there was a glitch where you could go through a wall using the smart cover that would get you into the play area without really starting the mission making it so that you could destroy the apc using the sticky launcher in the 11 update they ed crafting to hell with making a huge increase in the amount of materials needed to craft another materialgear theyre solution isnt to fix the ups in their coding their solution is to ban the people who found a way through their coding they figure out a way to make players go hey thats pretty good and then make them say kill yourself the game itself is beautiful and i really like the work that they put into making this new york look so amazing that seems like the one thing they got right in short i would either not buy the game wait until every ing thing is fixed but we know that wont happen or wait until it becomes about 20 in about a year or so ubisoft fix this steaming pile of fix your ing coding get a ing anticheat in place stop adding more clothing packs until you fix what needs to be fixed fix the ing crafting system and fix the ing dz and i dont mean by adding new brackets i mean by not making ridiculously tough to get like some in the dz03 vender you arent adding any value to the game by forcing people to grind in the zone until level 90 you are just making them play this copy and paste mission simulator longer,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,bought the season pass everything for 100 played about 237 hrs tldr opinion just press the back button of your browser paid content for season pass will come at summer and i wont even download it extra info this was my first ubisoft purchase and also was first season passpreorder thing those who familiar with ubisoft can laugh at me i deserved it itll be lengty review so if you decided to buy the game i strongly advise that you read all as this may be your last salvation chance before you face your demise 1 lies everything about this game is a huge lie i cant express how this communitymanager gone full mad when the developer say something on the stream or anywhere players can be sure it is a lie because they lied so many times not like implying things but straight up lies examples season pass owner shouldve got so many things by now exclusive drops montly events and sports outfit what people get is a level 7 weapon that you will never use youll get it at level 8 its a shotgun which no one use montly events are under development yet they still advertises with season pass exclusive drops are just bunch of craps that you can farm in 3 minutes and we had a promise for sports outfit which they advertised with season pass and they said oh it we never said itll be free pay for it guys the dev says we wont change x in next update and boom 3 days later they did change it it was something about craft system and people adjusted their crafts for this piece of lie i really really dont get into e3 trailer and the features shown there it was a embodiment of lie really goodjob over there im not even mad thats awesome how you milk your sheep customers like these these are straight up lies with many others at developer streams i just cant take it anymore ill just hate the all the development team 1a advertisement lies this would alone make a book or seperate phd documentary im not talking about little things like how this game is the farthest thing to be cover based shooter as they advertised im talking about straight lies from directly developers they say every lie to sell the game with preorder or with season pass including false bundles free items exclusive content not exist 2the biggest wasted opportunity the city is huge not only that is awesome like they create a beautiful city and say the rest youll only stay in it and grind till level 30 40 hrs then you will never see it with the patch 12 they try to make you replay the city but it just dont work it gets repetitive too soon too fast only way to enjoy the game and see some diversitychallenge is going dz which i explain later 3cheaters after level 30 if not earlier you have to grind at dark zonemultiplayer zone always which is a nest for cheaters the game uses client trust protocol which means you can do whatever cheat you want teleport around kill all the server with one single shotyes it exist etc and since best loot is in the dark zone you have to go there and get killed by a cheater after patch 11 they banned many cheaters but ubisoft is the worst publisher in term of an anticheat it just dont exist massive is banning people manually which would take years to ban all cheaters gg there are many many cheater vulture at dz and it wont get resolved before ubi implement an anticheat system which will never happen one last hilarious thing about cheating probably you didnt know every week some developer plays the game and stream it can you actually believe that developer got rekt by a blatant cheater over and over after that the dev just shut down the pc and get on the xbox can you ing believe it and do you know what dev did he just noted his nickname with a pencil and paper there is a cheater list on the paper yeah thats right thats how devs will solve it manually coming up at 2036 wp please go youtube for the video 4poorly designed loot system the city is good but this is a lootgrind game so if you up the loot system you dont have a game and by looking other games from the genre like destiny or diablo this game by far has the poorest design they create many different weapons and armor pieces with each of them has 412 ability or option which all of them vary the thing is you need 1 spesific one that actually you can use or the bis item for you best in slot you cant craft it so you have to loot for it and your chance is 00000000001 if not less there is not a single player who compleated hisher armor weapons without cheating so most of time you go dark zone grind for 45 hours get the base check your loot deconstruct all for crafting material which give you material for 1 try try crafting fail aaaaaand zero imagine doing this for 23 weeks if you enjoy this buy the game the thing with this game is like making a rabbit run with a carrot on the stick ubisoft never give you the carrot and thus you will never complete your gear or not even feel little satisfaction or success after hours of play 5bugs oh my lord its really amazing how much bugs can a single game contain its alot even for a early access indie board game let alone this is aaa title game from ubishit itd only make sense if they make their drunk intern to code this game do you know whats more amazing the duration of these bugs stay in the game ill give you headlines and most annoying ones and let you imagine or see for yourself if you are stupid the rest the notorius ground bug when game started there was a bug cause you to fall from the ground to abyss devs said theyll fix it and now after 25 months later it still exists i can assure you this bug is the most annoying bug that ever existed in game history you can fall from pretty much anywhere anytimethere is a skill in game that allow you a deploy a cover on the ground you say since this is a coverbasedshooter it must be very opnice skill but no even if you unlock all of its features its one of the worst skill of all time but hey thats not the case the special thing about that cover it has bugy interaction with everything in the ing game you deploy it near wall voila you are now noclip deploy it ground voila you can fall from ground deploy it near missions voila fast forward the end of the mission there is a ing guide to use it as glitch guess what how ubi deal withfix it with the ing ubi way devs dont use it or well ban you hilarious there are glitches makes your inventory contain more item than it should or make you carry more health packsammo funny thing is devs are using them on their stream dude i dont know what to say more than this even this games very own devs accepts the bugsglitches and go with it 6 disappointment as i said before this games marketinglie budget is about same as game budget many people caught by the hype and bought gold edition at the day1 as people realised game is nowhere near at the point advertised they start to leave but many people wait including me as most of us know that upcoming patches may fix the issues and after 25 month i left the game with many others because hype is already dead and devs are nowhere near the fix the issues maybe just maybe the division would be good game at 2017 but by the time there wont be many players to see it many of players that left the game leave with great anger and disappointment that no matter what we wont return annnd lets face it its ubisoft it wont fix the game itll release a new game because we are already milkedalso check steamdb about player counts if you dont believe me believe me there are many issues other than those if you are don quijote go for it and face your demise,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i expected much from the game before its release but i knew ubishit would fail yet again didnt preorder the game and didnt bought it in the first week to wait for reviews after a while a friend convined me to buy so i play in the darkzone with him thought pvp would actually be enjoyable oh boy was i wrong after i bought the game i realized i have to play through the campaign first to get on my friends level as the pvp area is splitted by level so i played all the campaign missions thats the reason for the playtime and oh boy was that boring in the entire game are like 4 different models for enemy ai all weapons play and feel the same only difference is if u play shotgun or sniper but aside from that gaining a new weapon does absolutely nothing except changing the numbers enemies are just bulletsponges bosses are just normal ai with better clothing and instead of having to do certain stuff to kill them you just have to put 1000 shots of your light machine gun in their head like what thats all missions feel the same there is no diversity in map design or how to approach your enemy you always run into a new area hide behind a wall throw grenades oder the wall and give each ai 50 headshots to kill them run into the next area thats all thats the entire game pvp is a bit more interesting since ai in campaign is stupid af but its still boring do not waste your money thx,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,me where to start with this game probably one of the most anticipated games ever and now the playerbase is basically nonexistant the only players left are hackers cheaters and desperate fanboys who refuse to believe that their once beloved the division has been reduced to a mindless grindfest with less than 2000 active players this game had so much potential so much and the developers fcked us over and gave us this piece of fcking i cant believe that the developers are still asking for the same price that the game had at launch 60 fcking bucks if it was a 10 or 15 dollar game then sure this review would probably be positive but 60 bucks thats a blatant scam no matter how you look at it this is a great example of how effective marketing can fool a large group of people to believe that a product is actually going to be good do yourself a favour and forget that this game ever existed and leave just like the other 90 of the playerbase did,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ok so i have played this game for a crazy amount of time and i will say the game is really great although the game is boring at the begining middle area of the game and the boss are very repetitive the last few missions of the game show extreme potential and are extreme fun and challenging i have completed the game and pretty much tested everything so i guess i can atempt to list some of the things i found awesome and some not awesome stuff 1 challenging difficulty is freaking insane it isnt just a small step above hard its a very large jump it gives you a challenge and there is no way in hell you are just picking this up at fresh 30 and just farming your some superior items unless youre the dankest memer the world has ever seen 2 final mission without spoiling to much its very difficult if you do it on hard solo and shows extreme potential for raid content and variety in the game instead of just shooting bosses or hitting t and just holding yourr left click 3 darkzone the darkzone is crazy cool and the concept is rich with potential only complaint is it kinda encourages you to just stealthly betray people rather than full on pvp but the pve aspects are great and the rush from getting your first high grade item and trying to evac it is just great 4 the content seems to be planned on a consistent basis we can hope that they stick to it but for now they have already planned out the first 3 expacs for this game only downside is you gotta pay for them or the season pass bad things in the game 1 it is really hard for players that do the game solo its very doable but if youre not good at shooters its not going to be that easy they do have the matchmaking system but lets be honest past the first few first months of this game the lower levels wont be able to do much match making 2 until about level 25 the game is a cake walk and the content is pretty repetitive at the start you are immersed and loving them game and then you get to id say about level 10 and its just boring for the next 15 levels luckily its fast leveling 3 pvp exists but its not instance based or really encouraged having something like a battleground or arena or something of this nature would help the pvp driven players find that thing that is missing darkzone pvp is stale and boring and no body wants to lose xp or coins right now so yeah 4 its 60 plus another like 30 for the season pass in this day in age your game better have some craaaazy content to be 60 for instance not even wow does 60 expansions anymore its just not a good idea especially with the content in game right now i dont think this game is 60 value in june or so maybe because then we get a new expansion ok the last thing i would like to bring to late is the idiots saying this game is repetitive and server crash issues are stupid etc etc its repetitive because its an mmo with shooter aspects not the other way around if you look at every single mmo out there it is repetitive even the sandbox mmos have repetition server crash issues should be expected the first day a game is out its server flooding and the beta as good as it was doesnt really give you a 100 sure idea when a game comes out most games experience lag and dcs day one or in first few hours now that the game is a few days old servers are fine and gameplay is really smooth hope this review helps and good luck shameless plug httpswwwtwitchtvtagord96 if you wanna watch some footage,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,edit 61116 i have been told ubi is now offering perma bans to hackers and the community is on its way to recovery i will attempt to log in and check and update shortly please see comments for more info pros concept story story telling love that you learn the back story through so many ways qsts phone calls echos journals the details painted on desks and walls and even post it notes details the game is full of them lots of nice touches graphics though certain points glitched for me when server stability would spike and people would dc game play ui diversity of missions mmo style fps negatives lack of end game talents and skills on gear are often flat out wrong bugs from alpha still have not been addressed every patch has new exploits and i swear at this point i think ubisoftmassive are purposely putting them in the game some of the exploits there is no way i feel a player naturally just found it dark zone is impossible to play due to the hacks hackers do not get a permamnent ban they get multiple warnings instead community it is negative and filled with every language spamming the chat nonstop adding friends in the game is a pain you have to go to the ubisoft system you cannot do it in game ui itself character creation my female looks like a man and i had 3 choices hackers hackers hackers there are so many hackers that the hackers complain about hackers i am not joking go google it there are hacks for everything making the dark zone which was a huge selling point of the game and a major piece of the game content pointless,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,update 01102016 since the game has updated again and i seldom played the game after v12 the comment may be outdated however i did try the underground dlc which is better than the former s h i t but still not worth my 60 so still not recommend ps i have got a rude comment recently about my spending hundreds of hours with a negative comment calling me hypocritical it is the first time i know that playing much keeps me from thumbs down which is hypocritical from a guy without public profile haha of course i deleted it in no time warning slight spoiler alert the game has wonderful stories wonderful art design and a big title of tom clancy but it is not a good game at all it is full of deception in the first 20 hours you survive alone in ruin nyc everything seems to be new attracting and challenging and then you get to lvl 30 you enter the dz get killed by all kinds of cheaters and hostile players it sucks you try to clear daily missions have equipment with better gs spends hours on a stupid challenge mission it is stupid because the golden gear of lvl 182 is nothing comparing to the new gear set in the new mission which is too hard that those who made it cant pass it in one try and it will soon get outoftime in no time and ubisoft have run the game perfectly against the normal player fixing every bug that make players grow quickly in a rush while leaving those cheaters as the king of the world not to mention the spam message in the public channel and the awful potato servers with frequent disconnect lag and error the biggest sadness is that when you realize all of this you have passed the refund time thats why i call it deception general score 010 not recommend 4 great story 4 great tps experience 8 ubisoft running no anticheating mechanism terrible servers with force internet links ps i wont purchase any ubisoft game again i would use pirate copies if the game were really attracting update 2742016 recently i saw ubisofts efforts against cheating by moving some of the mechanism from local clients to the servers such as reload clip in a way it makes the game more realistic your weapons may stuck time to time and you cant reload or shoot for a few second in fact it is only caused by lag i save those complaints and let you friends imagine what will happened if your weapon failed in a war zone i have heard that the designers put some parts of calculating on local clients to relieve the bundle of servers which is the source of unstoppable cheating now they wanna correct it by moving them online step by step let us see if the newest gourmet from france are fried potato chips update 15052016 the most desperate thing is that you cant shoot cant heal yourself cant use firstaids no dps to the enemies but they can still shoot you dead that is the worst thing in the game even for a gamer spent hundreds of hours on it update 25052016 update 12 is alive the boring dailyampweekly are removed instead a much boring system of daily and weekly is live now i dont see any need to do these searchampdestroy things just a set of mission done before havent done new missions yet maybe better maybe worse but never worth the price,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,tldr ubisoft brought an amazing concept to the world and once again didnt listen to its fanbase and so the game fell to ruin thanks to lack of anticheat and rampant hacking in pvp now the actual long part surprisingly enough the pve is plenty fun and challenging enough for a while typical copypaste fetch quests area defense and assassination targets the forgettable story is crappily stapled on to the endless grind to reach level 30 after that there are plenty challenging daily missions and other repeat missions for higher quality loot which is all fine and dandy until you decide that its not enough then you go to the dark zone or dz for short dz is the part where they royally messed up the dz has its own currency its own ranking system and its own rules to start off the dz has its own ranking system separate from single player the level cap is much higher and the quality of loot increases with each level the trick is you have to visit the dz every few single player levels to rank up your dz rank so you arent completely outgeared and outmatched by the time you hit rank 30 outside the dz not fun and not well thought out especially considering if you die in the dz you lose a few dz levels second is the currency forget all that money youve been earning through your single player experience dz only takes dz credits in exchange for getting dz quality gear only way to get dz credits is by slaying mobs in the dz should you find yourself dead in the dz you lose a portion of your dz credits far more than youd earn in a simple run through the fastest mob routes so profit is tough especially if youre underleveled dont let that get you down because if you want high quality gear without the dz theres always the dailies and weeklies you can beat to earn yet another type of currency to use back at the home base but not to buy good weapons just the blueprints you gotta craft the weapons and hope you get the stats and skills you want on it now for the grand scheme take the levels the currency and add in pvp pvp is possible in the dz but you get punished for doing so killing players or stealing loot will mark you as a rogue agent for a short duration will put a bounty on your head and make you visible to all other players in your vicinity if you can live through the timer you get the bounty if you get killed your killer gets the bounty the more players you kill in a short span the higher the bounty and the longer the timer pretty fun and fair for all except its not thanks to a nearnonexistant anticheat system the dz is rife with players using hacks and exploits to simply ruin others days mix that in with trying to earn dz levels and dz credits and your in for a lot of profit loss the worst part after all of that is ubisoft doesnt care not like its anything new but this really takes the cake ubisoft deaf to the aguish and cries of the users continues on its merry little path of getting out all its year one content patches bug fixes adding in new missions new currencies that we cant keep track of new gear guns and much much more and yet no anticheat no help for those who thought this game was a much needed change from the pace of rinseandrepeat first person shooters i can only pray they dont let for honor fall into the same pit of despair that they have the division ps hey ubisoft if youre reading this you should add battleye to the division like you did siege its kinda helping,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,lootbased game rife with hackers exploiters and nothing to do with the loot once you get it other than merely troll people in the dark zone which isnt what i or any sane person wants to do,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,its a pretty good game especially if you like pve grinding rng and all that the main issue and reason for the majority of negative reviews was the overall end game once you reach level 30 the latest 14 patch has delivered most of what the people were asking for and certainly to me this has fixed any issue i had with the end game sekhat temporus goes into great detail of what to expect in this reviews comments,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,imagine getting promised a ferrari getting delivered an audi drive it for a month and find out its a honda a day later turning out to be a lemon its a shame what happened to this game at least the movie might be better probably not i blame esports,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,the only real enemies here are server lag and a bunch of hackers inside dark zone an issue which ubisoft havent resolved until now especially those hackers who ruined my online experience,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,one of the best games i had ever played amazing graphics and environment more then 500 hours on this played mostly solo because my friends simply didnt had the patience to understand this game mechanics and gear system playing solo it was painfull its not fun being chased around by groups of players just killing you just because they could 13 almost destroyed this game and the devs saw that and what they did on this game is nothing short of amaizing they actually listened to the people playing it and fixed most of the isues respecting what the community was saying 14 its a revolution on the game mechanics and made the game balanced even for solo players like me and now 15 and survival survival its amazing everything that it didnt matter in game before it matters now water food meds the gear that was cosmetic only now has a purpose starting outside the dz and making your way there it actually feels challenging even in this time the devs are making questionaires on what the community would like to see in the division the devs could have simply let the game die but they didnt i give them respect for that and for listening to the ones playing it accepting all the critics and improving the game vastly i was waiting for this for my review if you get this make shure you get the gold edition with the season pack its half the price now and survival alone is worth it but hey i know nothing about games im just a noob having fun and this game just got fun,1,1

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,tom clancys the disappointment,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,having tons of fun with this game cool fightingshooting mechanisms lots of loot great customizability exciting to upgrade gearitems decent story absolutely brilliant to play with friends great difficulty sense of freedom darkzone feels terrifying as a new player cons repetitive grindy gameplay although i would also write this for a game like diablo conclusion feels like rainbow six and diablo 3 had sex and got this child 910,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,despite all the negative reviews i actaully enjoy this game pros amazing graphicsits still fine for me after the graphics downgrade open world fairly accurate to the real nyc tons of loot tons of side quest about 12 hours into the game and i only explored 14 of the map am slow in learning and it took me some time to get used to the game different people have different speeds so dont know about others xd clothing customization item crafting replayabilty cons occansional disconnect and crashes hard to find matchmaking most of the time story is character creation is can get boring if solo conclusion i love division dlcunderground underground is damm fun but its difficult to complete challenging mode alone ps the new update has made the dark zone alive again,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,we finally made it out of the beta,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,it took me a long time several days of play time to come to this conclusion the division is in no way a bad game it is however aggressively mediocre it is forgettable deeply flawed and a huge missed opportunity the first thing i want to get to is the dark zone it is in both practice and concept a horrible experience the best gear in the game ostensibly the goal for most people playing an rpg is gated behind an experience that relishes having other players steal your hardearned loot i literally would have zero problem with this if there were a way to get that kind of gear elsewhere in pve but there is not the stance of the developers and some fans of well nut up and play the game or go away on this is simply insulting why they would put this dayzruststyle anarchy as the center of endgame is beyond me the next big issue enemy variety there is none i have now played almost 18 hours of this game and i have encountered five kinds of enemy total 1 hoodie wearing thug with a pistol 2 hoodie wearing thug with a baseball bat 3 cleaner a faction focused on burning out the infection with a flamethrower 4 cleaner with a riot shield 5 bullet sponge boss this is absolutely absurd and downright embarassing eighteen hours in and ive been killing hundreds of the exact same mob apparently all named alex because the line they gotkilled alex is chirped ad nauseum by the braindead ai next the story pathetic your character is mute and thus far in the game 18 hours of play ive met four main characters only one of which has had more than 1 minute of talking time a doctor a security chief a quirky technician and a fellow division agent wheres this story going who knows whats my driving force to continue who knows its as if the writers threw their hands in the air and said well nobody is playing this game for the story anyway right wrong for a game that clearly blew so much budget on making a cinematic story experience its simply sad how flat on their faces it fell in all the story missions ive done theres no exposition except through some radio chatter you never meet any of the bosses they all have generic names and tons of hp etc etc etc the final nail in the coffin for me is just how mindnumbingly boring it can be to play alone matchmaking is only available while in a safe house hub where you are sharded with 56 other players most of which are afk and even then matchmaking is only available for story missions if you wanted to explore and do side quests you would need to try and matchmake under free roam which nobody queues for so you do most of the side content alone and you need to do side content because the story missions are spaced so far apart in level that you couldnt seamlessly go from one to the next i think the true issue behind the division is that you feel unimportant you are simply a drone the entire first wave of agents died or went missing spoiler for the first 5 minutes of the game im the worst and you could go missing too and they would just send more you get so little money for completing missions and for selling the loot you acquire that you feel like you cant buy anything its a 40ish hour slog if you play comfortably rather than powergame to the top and then you just pull your hair out in frustration over the gimmicks of the dark zone i hate number rating systems because of how they boil down complex opinions into highly subjective numbers but if i had to rate this i would give it a 610 its a solid concept much like destiny was but the delivery falls flat in a pitiable way it needs a lot of work and it needs it yesterday edit i feel its important to be honest and amend my initial review with one fact the best gear is available outside the dark zones the caveat is that the acquisition rate is absurdly lower its no different than a cheap mobile game saying oh you can get all the best characters without buying them but its through a 1 droprate daily chest another key distinction its being worked on optional insert you er is not a valid defense i am reviewing the game i paid 60 dollars for not the one it vaguely promises to be,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,dont buy this game now they took their money and ran also mcdonalds wifi could handle more traffic than the ubisoft server they use for this game i mean come on ffs,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i did the unthinkablei preordered a ubisoft gamei know i know no need to kill methe thing isuntil last weekthis game was just awful almost unplayble even with friends which was very sad i used to play itevery once in a while for 1 or 2 hours but now after patch 14 i think this game is almost ready to be played daily by the people that like its stylethe game still has its bugswhich ubisoft will try to fix later onthere might still be a few exploits and all but not that manyafter patch 14 i think this game is starting to go on the right path for once i can say im proud of preordering from ubisoftaltough after no mans lie ill never preorder anygame ever again for safety just so you guys know how playable the game is now compared to launch and up to 13 i bought the season pass yesterday because i knew id have fun playing this game so it was a nice deal and the season pass is almost as expensive as the gameso yeah i rate this game currently 14 patch a 710 enjoyable with friendsfun and challenging when you are alone consthe game needs even more backstory to iti find this whole scenario fascinating to the point where i want to learn more more and more playing in the dark zone aloneis very risky there needs to be a way so that if you are solo in the dzyou get a small buff or something to help you run away from groups of roguesmaybe if you are alone you move insert percentage here faster than everyone else pros with friends and the underground dlc this game has a 810 level of replaybility and daily play so you know grab a few friends and play itincursions which have very nice loot and daily rewards encourage partnership between playerswhich in turn makes making friends easier that is allmy honest opinionive hated this game and i felt ripped off by ubisoft but now i can say that i will get my money back in playtime thank you all for reading,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,to start some of you might ask what the hell this guy has 90 hours in 2 weeks and he gives a negative review to this game well how can i explain this the game pve wise its very repetitive theres not really that feeling of immersion the story lacks content the boss fights are utterly boring just because theres no difference all the mobs have the same classes even if they are normalsuperiorelites or bosses there isnt really that mechanic that all self intituled rpgs have this game is just a shoot to kill let me explain this better this game for a rpg is very bugged and very badly structurized as the game stands now theres no balance and theres even a lack of options to counter some of the build that players have or there isnt even a option in certain cases to counter certain builds this in pvp wise some of the hardcore division fans might come and say well you obviosly never tryed challenge mode or dark zone and for them i can say im fulled maxed out i have all gear high end i have all that i wanted but the game still feels lacking and repetitive so to sum it up what can i say about this game well this is a good game for innocent people for people who just want to play with their friend and shoot to kill nothing more ps i will wait for the new expansion coming in april with the trade option and the incursions to update my review since i will no longer play endgame content and i will just play the division leveling all slots until that expansion launches and for all the hardcore fans obseced by the division look at their budget the time they took to create the game 5 years all the times they tricked us with one massive trailer where the game was amazing totally different graphics and ok they did well lowering the pc requirements but at least give an option to download that textures the game is addicting but a massive letdown for all the hype the game is not definitly worth 60 euros and even less worth more 40 euros for the dlcs right now,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,in the beginnig i really enjoyed this game and to be fair the gameplay mechanics alone are still nice but at time i asked myself are the devs utterly clueless poor trolls or just dont care once they have your money rife with cheaters hidiously grindy i like a grind i have almost all exalted factions in wow on 1 character endgame difficulty scales poorly endgame forces you to pvp save yourself the money dont bother,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,fun at first with great mechanics until you complete the storyline and reach the end game which doesnt take that long the endgame is tailored to people that cheat and exploit with in and out of game means as there is no punishment for exploiting the game mechanics and amassing items at a non normal speed the developer just adjusts the overall gameplay to the exploitation environment making it even harder for legit players to keep up so if you like exploiting glitches in a multiplayer game with no strings attached and afterwards rotflstomping players in the pvp zone this is the perfect game for you otherwise i would not recommend spending money and time in this game,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i did have fun with this game especially playing with friends the game has interesting mechanics but the story and content lacks depth dz was fun for a while till you meet your daily hackers ruining the game for everyone sure you can report them if you have the time and energy they will only get a few days ban according to forums and they will be back at it again after the ban is lifted wouldnt recommend this game on its current state and for its current price even if its on a 50 discount think hard and think twice before buying it,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,unfinished game most elements that wouldve made this game great didnt make it to the final game disappointing story multiplayer that doesnt makes much sense only people who like pointless grinding would enjoy this game i certainly did not,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ill start this off by simply saying that the line between the good and bad reviews ie the division of people playing is quite rough on one side there is the people that enjoy the game and will defend it beyond measure and the other side is such vile hatred that cannot be swayed with that out of the way here is my review the good the bad and the indifferent its long so tldr do your homework the bad there is a bit too much cusion between mission spots that leaves the game feeling a bit barren with this im not sure that populating the game world with group after group of enemies would be beneficial since it is already cumbersome enough to deal with normal groups of them but some sort of filler wouldnt be a problem here there are items to track down echos to review documents to find etc but the average gamer isnt going to spend a lot of time with this i personally enjoy it since it really is the only way to get a real sense of the story but who am i to say if its good mission variation is lacking there are only a few types of missions to do most of them involving go here and killprotect this or free some hostages the story missions have a bit of meat to them longer and more involved but there are far more side missions than main missions so this can wear on you a little difficulty scaling is just weird sometimes you run into yellowmain and bluemini bosses that just defy the current level range you are on this is mitigated by grouping up but to the solo player you are going to be punching your desk with some missions i know i knowgit gudbut seriously the rewards dont justify the headache sometimes background banter the main story voice acting is pretty decent but the stuff going on with civilians and vendors doesnt fit the theme of the game one guy is a struggling actor thats been in action movies so he knows what you are feeling and the civilians are seemingly oblivious to the horror going on around them not really a huge issue but it breaks the immersion too often the good compatibility issues aside this game is actually quite beautiful turning everything all the way up in the settings is a treat for the eyes there were moments when i just had to stop in a snow storm at night and just stare at the lighting and atmosphere again this is removing the issues people are having with their setupsconfigs pc gaming at its finest gunplay is fun and visceral the key here is to remove yourself from the actionshooter mindset this is an rpg at heart and not designed in a way that allows you to just mow through mobs like a superhero i was one of three people that enjoyed operation raccoon city any resident evil fans and this feels like the way re should have been playing with a few friends is really fun and rewarding the varied skills and talents you can choose make grouping with people enjoyable you can definitely take on much harder missions and have some intense firefights this is equally so in the dark zones once the pvp area is fully operational i expect to be spending a lot of time there as i did in the betas as stated above the perks and skills are useful and fun you can really cater the output of your character to how you play the game spend a lot time going from cover to cover there is a skill that ups the damage you do based on how far you sprinted to a new cover spot rely on grenades get a skill that rewards you for damaging multiple enemies at once with explosives there is plenty to mess around with here the indifferent the story is what you make of it it requires a bit of reading and listening to wrap your head around what is going on most of the story is told through various media and the story quests only give you a recap of what is currently happening gotta put the work in to really get into this character customization is pretty low i only play with a small group of friends but if this is supposed to be an mmo style game people should be able to go nuts with their characters technicalserver issues some people are having a bad time with this others just intermittently this is the battle we fight as pc gamers it will get ironed out and patience is a virtue i got lucky with this game but ive had my fair share of waiting with others just to play them allinall im having a ton of fun with this game and with the dlc planned in the future it seems like my friends and i will get our moneys worth if you were blinded by the hype prior to the release of the game you may walk into disappointment but if you enjoyed the beta and like a slower paced semitactical rpgshooter hybrid you might be pleasantly surprised dont let the reviews sway you mine included do your research and decide for yourself hope to see you in ny,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,most people thought this game was going to suck honestly it did in some ways however i peaked my interest enough for me to play for 110 hours let me explain why i would recommend this game and why i would not first off i will talk about why i would recommend it the story mode is awesome i had fun and enjoyed it if you are a grindaholic this is the game for you and i would fully recommend it you can grind your heart out in challenge missions after level 30 and then use the phoenix credits to buy great new gear to go back and do the same thing so basically thats it for level 30 ok well there is also the dark zone actually that is pretty much the same thing you find a group and you kill for hours and hours to reach dark zone 50 and then what you get gear with dark zone currency or phoenix credits let me explain another reason to why this game is great for people who love to grind you can also craft the same gear over and over and over again until you get something you actually want or is useful however you will spend a lot of time getting mats and of course doing challenge missions or dark zone for hours to get them you see i am a grindaholic and thats why i played for so long to see if the fruits of my playing would turn out but this is uninteresting to me there is not much controls or content to even stay connected and the abilities and skills limit to only a few useful ones talents are kind of ehhhhh but i feel a lack of skills this game is not recommended for the most part because it is a grindfest if you do not like to grind do not buy it be prepared for countless hours doing challenge missions or dark zone getting the same gear and currency over and over hoping you will get something good i had fun but its not for me if this review helped out wonderful if not i apologize and contact me at aciteozgmailcom for further info about this game,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,ill go as far to say this is the biggest disappointment since brink so much potential and a great foundation but its another aaa title released with littletono content and you will likely have to spend over 100 to get a decent experience with future dlc not only that but there are so many stupid bugs that are still in the game that shouldnt be after an alpha and two betas there are also cheaters around like mad in the dark zone a beautiful world but its so barren theres almost no reason to free roam the map as there are no real random events on the map i just cant help but feel disappointed with what could have been as of now stay away and avoid like the plague i usually dont preorder games for this reason but they somehow convinced me to get hyped for this game after the beta my mistake,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,great idea for a game with absolutely huge potential ruined by cheaters dont bother buying this game its already dead,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,this game is garbage 155 hours and what have i done the same damn instances with the same friends all the time to grind for the best gear 75 grinding 25 dark zone do you want to waste your life on the worst aaa 3rd person shooter ever made be my guest there is absolutely no anxiety or tension in the dark zone because you have nothing to lose or gain from it its just pointless unsatisfying combat thats right it is not satisfying at all to kill other players doesnt matter if i live or die you or i will be back in a minute to try and kill me or i try to kill you again its an endless cycle its just something to do to pass the time edit the game uses variable ratios to keep the player interested meaning after killing the same boss for the 20th time the game rewards you with what you wanted the whole time i give up after the 2nd or 3rd time of not getting what i want because i dont have time to grind all day even if the game rewarded me with what i wanted 100 of the time i probably would have stopped playing earlier on because then i have nothing to work for and nothing else to use my amazing gear with if pvp was more fun that would keep me engaged and buying more dlc who really wants more pve why would you buy the underground dlc other similar games release content like that for free i personally want an extension of the map and the dark zone and raising the level caps and adding better gear gear in the dark zone and adding several more instances 15 for a single randomized instance are you ing kidding me it doesnt add anything new to the game still the same boring enemies and boring boss battles the tactical aspect of the game is dead in the end game just stick together and spray the out of every enemy now if pvp was any good there would be tactics in that aspect of the game except for the groups that get 8 to 12 people in the same dark zone the game has one of the most tedious reward systmes to keep a person playing they need to keep adding new rewards or there will be nothing to gain and no one will play any more or buy the new content the pve instances and pve instances rewards are all that keep people playing,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,my biggest mistake was back then to believe that ubisoft would release a game that wouldnt be bugged unpolished and free of issues with my uplay account telling me that i have spent ingame more then 100 hours i kinda have to say that i got back what i had paid for back then but at the same time it kinda feel like i should have waited at least another six months before i bought the game over the last couple of months tom clancys the division has improved a lot and at least i believe that ubisoft tried to fix the game and finally got it where it should have been when it had launched earlier this year if you have waited till today with buying the game now would be the right time to get it,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i really wanted to love this game but am ultimately disappointed as a whole this game is super repetitive and boring once you get to lvl30 you will literally do the same handful of things over and over and over and over the darkzone isnt fun at all you run a farming route or get killed by rogues over and over and over even with the new patch its more of the same tired old stuff that we have already done a thousand times the game is just a really long grind for some perfect pieceset of gear that is ultimately useless once you get it theres no sense of reward or accomplishment just time wasted im all for wasting my time and everything but theres much better ways to do it than by playing the division i really would like to recommend this game but i just cant,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,fun for the first 20 hours then gets really repetitive and boring as hell it not worth your money in my opinion,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,imagine buying tom clancys the divison and not thinking that its the worst decision youve ever made in your life thats how this game makes me feel after the repetitive story and horribly unbalanced pvp section 3610 buy it on sale but since its ubisoft its never going below 50 for the next 5 years,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,14 is here we back,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,they have found the formula it took them until patch 14 to do it but this game is great now forget everything you heard or saw at release if youre looking for a lootershooter that actually has tactical team gameplay and gets more fun as you increase the difficulty there is nothing better out there right now,1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i spent 90 for this steaming load was it worth it you bet your it was pros you get to phase through the map when you look into the sky your game flickers repetitive gameplay didnt live up to 2013 e3 reveal uplay cons tom clancys the division get cancer ubisoft,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,update i tried to contact ubisoft directly for a refund only to get this message hey the division is only just getting started today the second free dlc conflict is available to all players however from june onwards there will be several major dlc drops for season pass holders check out the full schedule here httpsdivisionzone20160303thedivisionsyearonecontentreleaseroadmap see how they really care about questions heh pros decent graphics nice weapons mods cons ubisoft no content from season pass other than outfits hackers darkzone is broken game is broken in general hackers story lacks you wont remember anyone at the end unbalanced bosses did i mention hackers xp is broken loot sucks game is painful after level 20 getting to level 30 is way to easy 30 levels is a ing joke for an open world multiplayer that had so much potential the overwhelmingly negative on the steam store page doesnt give it enough justice also valve you are a wonderful company but refunds should be intitled to a game that is overwhelmingly negative it doesnt matter if its opinion based if its that bad then its popular opinion do your customers a favour and entitle refunds for the season pass or the game itself for 24 hours 210 suck my balls ubisoft and massive entertainment,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i dont even know where to begin id like my money back for this 15 piece of that i paid 60 for the combat is good i rather like how it handles that said its all the good i have to say about this game its repetitive same 45 missions repeated levels are kindof bogus crafting is kindof bogus the dark zone well the recent patch was pretty much a hey you people weve got your money so why should we care kind of thing the hackers are persistant youd have more fun playing daikatana its pretty much in the same vein and if you get that reference more power to you avoid at all costs,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,first of all its not my review one of my friend who i do coop and we dont finish the game write this as e positive review and i just goin to change first and last line tom clancys the division its not fun even for first 30 40 hoursafter that game became boring and repetitive there is no end game content the content you get after finishing the game is repeating same missions on higher difficulty over and over again and nonstop gear grinding bad level design the only difference between missions is the mobs level you enter the level zone and the game keep spawning bullet sponge mobs pretty much a horde mod not interesting and bad storytelling there is only 3 4 type of enemy in this game crafting system designed to keep you grinding and doing same thing things over and over again the only thing you know before crafting a high end gear is the gear score the 3 talents are random and because of that you have to grind the materials and craft the same weapon 6 7 times to get the talents you want rng loot system sometimes 0 good loot after farming 10 hours sometimes tons of loot in 1 hour darkzone is broken cheaters are all over the place retarded rouge system peoples jump into your bullets to make you rouge no pvp game mod this game cant be fun in first 30 40 hours with less rpg elements skills perks and gear mods are not good enough to create unique builds and different play stylescharacters all r same shooting feels nice and smooth very good cover system good weapon modding but after you entered endgame all of these became boring and repetitive the division need more attention from ubisoft gameplay mechanics are awesome but the game really need some tweaks and serious contents highly recommended to play with friends and with voice or u get boredand wait for steam sales,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,perspective from just under 75 hrs played 120k dps 75k hp regular group of 3 i will definitely be a contributing piece of the playerbase who reluctantly walks away from the game its too bad too it is a great game just seems like the team went into panic mode to overcome some obstacles they didnt foresee and totally blew it i cant imagine this not being a dead game in record time editupdate i will level an alt to 30 and use the stash to transfer items back and forth between my farmercrafter and pker i will level another alt to what ever level it is gear mods open up on the mod vender for electronics i will level another alt to use the hub for every other resource for crafting its just really annoying to feel like you have to do this to enjoy the gameb due to some dumb changes to rules of the mechanics theyve set postrelease to combat progression they feel is too fast pros this game could be awesome if you have a group of 4 and all of you are motivated to get dope gear bullet registration is on point runs smooth on subpar machine see bottom of review for specs looks great story is great the only way i know this is the incredible amount of voice acting you get to or have to depending on your point of view listen to while doing missions most text driven mmos i just skip through being able to travel while having context fed to you is nice we have managed to figure out how to struggle through a challenger dungeon as a duo so full groups are not mandatory cons in order of appearance their pr community manager during the beta streams referred to going rogue as trolling not a great sign for people looking to pvp since then several changes reflect pvp to be an afterthought reinforcing the original idea pvp trolling is in fact shared with the vision of the game the direct quote is if you want to troll and go rogue you can do that you know but its going to come with a price no reward intended due to the incredibly high stakes and extreme disparity of reward basically none if you do go rogue be prepared to welcome 80 of the dz with open arms as they will come from all over to seek your for reasons stated above almost no one will go rogue but if you try to hunt rogues be prepared to desperately try to get the finishing hit on a downed guy in between a dozen other players with the same goal to get the incredibly huge chunk of xp you will almost certainly never see an exciting fight in this game blowout or nothing and im willing to wager 95 of the time someone goes rogue in this game it will be an accident i dont think itd be far off to say that same 95 of all rogue deaths will be from shots to the back while they were trying desparately to run away immediately after hearing the rogue gong phoenix coin from bosses nerfed no reason to farm bosses in dz for phoenix the only reason to go to the dz currently is if youre looking for a particular gun that doesnt currently have a blueprint available or to farm for exploits or both exploit the 2nd of the 2 reasons to go to the dz you can currently get an incredible edge with crafting materials giving you the ability to endlessly roll items until you get the ones you want this entails collecting items using the stash and an alt what it does is turn 30 minutes into an entire normal days worth of work acquiring crafting materials the xpac is releasing on xbox first pc amp ps4 will get it 1 month later with so little to do in the game as a result of crippling any desire to pvp it is very likely to be a dead game by the time that content is available dz bucks are worthless they didnt figure out a way to make these valuable once you become normal 30 dz 30 the best thing you can do with them is prepare to go to lvl 30 at normal lvl 29 by running around vendor to vendor making sure you have all the slightly better stuff the size of the map is small for an mmo it might take 10m to run from the n side of the map to the south side and from east to west it might take a little more the dz occupies a small chunk in the middle im typically the last to complain about frivolous expenses towards video games and almost never grab season passes or balloon packages i prepurchased gold for 100 i dont have to pay for the xpac but with the xpac releasing on xbox a full month prior to pc i can only imagine this game will be completely dead by then so a total waste pc specs about 60 fps with no feelings of input delay a lot of settings on low some on medium the streaming setting thing on 100 cpu i73770k oced to 44ghz w h100i cooling mem 16gb 1600mhz cl7 ddr3 storage samsung 850 evo 500gb sata iii ssd video evga 660 gtx os windows 7,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,i wanted to love this game i really did ever since its announcement i have been following it as close as possible pleading the developers to bring it to the pc the idea of an mmo modern shooter in new york city is a wonderful idea and early gameplay and later gameplay as well looked great now that i actually have the game well ive come to the harsh reality that the book isnt half as good as the cover art the division isnt a horrible game but it isnt the first class open world mmorpg shooter it sold itself as ill simply end up forgetting it lets look over the pros and cons pros the world itself is wonderfully constructed while the graphics are meh the actual construction of the city is great and it does feel like manhattan turned upside down trash is everywhere cars careened in the sides and hordes of hungry desperate people try to stay alive one minute you are participating in a pitched firefight at madison garden the next you are clearing an apartment room by room looking over the trashed remains of a childs bedroom that can hit you hard and these moments are the best the division has to offer the story works sort of its nothing special the acting is a little stilted but all in all it gets you into the world and invested in it you dont need much more from it than it provides teaming up with other players feels good and the tactics of team fighting work rather well the ai isnt anything special but it can be difficult enough to give a challenge to your team a verity of skills and specializations also make different characters work well together each having a role in your squad customization of your characters feels good outfits all work well and you can give your character a utilitarian unique look that fits the world it doesnt fall into the trap of one character wearing authentic armor and another a solid diamond bikini that many games fall into it all feels serious ingrained in the world cons combat is rather basic and even a little mind numbing every battle feels the same no matter what equipment your foes bring to the fight you use the same two abilities every time fire the same assault rifle and rarely use another weapon unless you run out of ammunition the ai isnt brain dead but it does nothing interesting nothing that will ever surprise you if you die its either because you make a dumb decision or you picked a fight with something that is simply too much of a bullet sponge to kill the graphics are meh if you play on a low to midtier system things will look really splotchy sort of muddy at all points higher end systems remedy this but even then its not anything we cant find in any other modern game the meat of the graphics is in its final product not the assets or effects used to achieve it the combat mechanics themselves are lackluster reminding me a lot of spec ops the line guns dont really feel different and against the persistent bullet sponge enemies you face your loadout feels weak at all times even the machine guns marksman rifles and magnum revolvers come off as piddle after you fire a few thousand rounds at a single foe wearing a hoodie they sound good but the feel and impact are lacking the total game lacks depth if you are going to do anything you do it by shooting want to save someone shoot someone gather gear shoot someone fix tech shoot someone recruit an ally shoot someone gather blood samples to counteract a deadly disease shoot someone there is just no variety and the core gameplay is too shallow to make up for this you will grow tired of this very quickly i have no issue with looters or grinders and have indeed enjoyed the aspect in a number of games i even liked destinys later implementation of it but this game just doesnt make it work all items feel the same some having higher numbers than others the few that have special abilities are really just stat increases that trigger every so often while i love the feeling of opening a container to find the secrets within the division just made me go yay 1 to my stat woooo in order to make a good looter the loot has to be special or at least exiting the division failed at this small increases in stats does not a good looter make the mmo aspect feels a bit sectioned off its as if the entire theory of this section was big fences make better neighbors in my entire play period i worked with another player all of one time and that was because i used the matchmaking which can take forever even on launch day you miss that special element of walking down the street and bumping into someone else or stumbling upon the remains of another players pitched firefight while areas like the dark zone do this well enough and safe houses allow you to rub noses with other agents the moment you walk out the door you are alone and you feel it an mmo should never ever make you feel alone like you are the only person around especially in the heart of new york city final thoughts ultimately the problem with the division is that i feel no need to return to it im not hooked into the story and while the world they built is extraordinary the content within it is ultimately unappealing i dont want to go through another firefight in the division i dont want to go hunting for weapon parts or rummaging through contaminated areas to find a new jacket for my character i simply feel no need to return the gameplay is uninspiring the progression yawninducing the looting commits the most grievous sin i dont feel excitement when i open a container or search a body thats my experience with the division i would not recommend it also first review not to mention the horrors of uplay shoot,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,the game was fun for a little while pros graphics are nice playing with a friend is entertaining for at least 40 hours cover system feels very smooth usually cons lack of content there are about 5 different types of enemies bullet sponges ai is braindead pvp is a joke lots of weird bugs uplay ubisoft needs to die,-1,1
365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,hackers and exploiters save your money this game is so far gone at its current state 04202016 hackers and exploiter have ruined this game or should i say the developers incompetence i think i now have stockholm syndrome where i feel like i also need to be like the hackers and exploiters to keep upthe darkzone is a joke with the amount of overly geared people from exploiting the incursion and aim bot rapid fire hackers now today with the infinite mats exploit has to be the last straw my gear 196 is such a joke compared to them also when i join a lobby game i shouldnt be told that i suck for not knowing the exploit to the incursion lol ubisoft claims to be banning hackers and exploiter but i see none of this as a player or is everyone but me hacking a 3 day ban is nothing compared to the rewards gained good thing i got the regular edition saved me 40 dollars of hate,-1,1
